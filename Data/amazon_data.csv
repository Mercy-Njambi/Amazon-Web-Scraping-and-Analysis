0,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I purchased the F3S to replace my Umidigi A7 Pro which I purchased in 2020. I was reading about this device and could not find it on Amazon.ca but did find it available on Amazon.com. Shipping to Canada was much faster than I had anticipated taking only 4 business days to get to me. I've used the FS3 for a few days now and here are my first impressions. First off the setup was the easiest I've ever had with a phone(not sure if that praise is to Google or Umidigi or both), I was up and running with all my apps downloading in under 5 minutes. The device arrived with the battery at around 90%. There was a system update waiting after the initial setup. If you haven't used a Umidigi device before one thing that surprises me is their continued update support. The day after purchasing this device I received a system update for my 2 year old A7 Pro, a lot of manufactures will stop releasing any updates a year after they are released Umidigi breaks this norm. The packaging was very slick and simple, it did not give the impression that this was a budget device. The device was very secure in the packaging no jostling what so ever. There were also stickers on the front and back of the device showing the features and layout of the phone which was handy. The package also contains a USB Charger/good quality cable(looks the same as the cable that came with my A7 Pro which is still functioning after 2 years). There is also a gel case that comes with the device, it is good quality but I find that it can get slippery to hold, I have ordered two other cases to replace it. The phone operates smoothly for my day to day tasks, the battery lasts me the day and if I forget to plug it in overnight I still have about 20-25% battery in the morning. It can also handle gaming as well(although the device does get fairly warm). The finger print reader has so far been very reliable not many misreads and no lock outs. The shortcut button is a handy feature although one draw back is it will only function when the screen is on. I've set mine up to: Flash light, Camera, Voice Record for single press, double press, and long press respectively. I did have a minor issue with reconnecting to hidden wi-fi networks but was able to resolve this by going into the developers options and disabling ""Wi-Fi scan throttling"" it seems to be a battery saving option, if you don't need to connect to a hidden network you will have no hassles. The speaker is a single speaker it does the job but its not anything special, I rarely use it I prefer to use headphones. The FS3 also comes with a headphone jack which comes in handy when your ear buds die or are misplaced(hahaha). The headphone jack is on the top of the phone and the power cable plugs in to the bottom, I would have preferred them both being on the bottom but its not a big issue. I've trusted the Umidigi brand the last few years and when I needed a new phone I looked to them first because I knew I was going to get the best bang for my hard earned buck. So far I am very pleased with the phone and hope to get a few good years out of it."
1,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I got this as an ""update"" to my last Umidigi phone - an A11 - because, while I really liked the A11, I've gotten it in my head that I need a phone with NFC capabilities.I'm glad I decided to pull the trigger on the purchase, especially considering the price on Prime day.As always with Umidigi, the packaging itself is attractive, eye-catching, and high quality by itself. The phone inside of that packaging is the same.The screen size is great for watching media and the back of mine is a sparkling black color. All of the Umidigi phones I've had have been made of high-quality materials - both the screen and the rear of the phones are basically impossible to scratch. I'm absolutely *terrible* at holding onto things, so I drop my phone on hard surfaces multiple times a day and keep it in my purse pocket along with my keys. Despite this, I haven't had a screen or screen protector on an Umiidigi phone break or scratch at all.Not only is this F3S fast with its 6gb of RAM, the fingerprint sensor is *extremely* responsive and the battery has lasted me though 36 hours of relatively constant use. The NFC feature is honestly just fantastic. I've used it far more than I probably should have in the seven days I've had it with no problems and I'm so glad they included it on this model.The camera is really nice as well. The shutter speed doesn't have any delay and the image quality is very good. I haven't really had many things to take photos of because the weather has been terrible and my house is a mess, but I got a *really* good picture of my cat in pretty low light (I also included an accidental awesome picture of her from when I was trying out the ""burst"" mode while she was grooming herself in this review even though it's a bit blurred because she was moving lol)The only problem that's come up on this phone thus far is an issue with the notification volume being super loud sometimes, even when the phone is on silent. I did figure out that this is an Android issue (as opposed to a manufacturer problem) because I found the solution on a Pixel forum - for anyone experiencing this, the OS apparently gets the notification and media volumes mixed up. All you have to do is turn your media volume down to fix it. Kind of annoying, but not a particularly big deal.If you *do* happen to have any actual phone problems, Umidigi's customer service is absolutely top notch. They're super responsive and very helpful. I haven't had any real issues since a couple of phones ago, but any time I have needed to contact them (obviously within the year warranty), they've responded within 24 hours (not including weekends) and have solved my problems quickly - including being happy to replace a defective unit."

Â I've had several UMIDIGI phones before, but this one really stands out.  First, it's the right size for me (I'm 6'4"" and have a big head lol).  It fits perfectly in my hand and feels ""just right"" when making a call.  No fumbling with a smallish phone in my large hands, yet fits nicely in my front pants pocket.  It's amazingly light, too.This listing does a great job of describing the features and the reviews do well too so I will only emphasize ones that stand out for my own use.  They describe the screen as ""cinema-like immersive visual experience"" and it no hyperbole.  It is *stunningly* smooth, no shadowing and has absolutely incredible viewing angles.  It has a nice size for video viewing and is large enough to use for ebook reading.  It's actually the first phone that I found reading ebooks to be comfortable on, without eyestrain.It is fast, too.  Boots immediately and is very smooth between apps.  Battery life is really good too, but isn't too much different than my last UMIDIGI phone.  The very best thing is how well the thumb-based fingerprint reader works!!  This is the *ideal* location for a reader, as it is right where you naturally hold the phone and is on the button to open it.  I have never seen a reader work so fast recognizing and how fast the phone itself opens!I have but 3 negatives - this phone is awesome and loaded, so why not 2 speakers in stereo?  The screen is cinematic and gorgeous, and the absence of this is regrettable.  The next 2 are a bit of personal preference - while the camera is incredibly good, I could do with a bit lesser camera to have to have less of a camera bump.  I go caseless (it is gorgeous and made of durable material) and it rocks all over the place when on a desk or table.  While using the included case alleviates this, it still rocks a lot with it on.  Lastly, while UMIDIGI made the ""Beyond Dreams"" tagline less obtrusive than my previous phone, it is still there and just bugs me.  Just go with your brand and perhaps the model number.I tried to get some nice screenshots and a video of the smoothness of it but I cannot capture how nice it is in person.  It's first rate, comparable to the top of the line phones of other manufacturers.  At this price, it is a terrific buy that will serve well for years to come."
3,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Let's get this out of the way early, once again Umidigi has created a beautiful phone. I chose the 'Starry Black' over the 'Ocean Blue' this time and it's just as stunning as the blue is.Highlight #1 - NFC  - let me repeat, NFC that supports Google Pay, on an inexpensive phone for the U.S.A. market = #Winning.Highlight #2 - A full 6GB of ram and 128GB of LPDDR4X based storage. Storage is expandable.Highlight #3 - 5150mAh Battery. Coupled with the entry level Unisoc T610 Octa-Core Processor, which basically sips battery, this phone should get you through a full day of useage without breaking a sweat.Highlight #4 - 6.7-inch Display. It's crisp and clear and does surprisingly well outside. Ok, the colors are going to be washed out in bright, direct sunlight, but at least you can still read the screen if the need arises.Highlight #5 - Sony 48MP AI Triple Camera. I;ll need to read up and take some picturesHighlight #6 - Still comes with a headphone jack. Bluetooth still doesn't quite cut it for audio performance and I am glad to promote a phone that still includes a headphone jack.Highlight #7 - They have included a wall charger in the box.For us old-school peeps who still listen to FM Radio, Umidigi has included one. And gome one step farther by NOT requiring a headphone to be connected to be used as an antennae - it works without one just fine.A quick stop at some niggling points: the auto-brightness algorithm could use some improvement and Umidigi doesn't exactly provide timely updates, but does seem to release an update to fix issues.Th UI is basically stock Android. No fluff, no extra, duplicated, unneeded apps.Fingerprint reader is integrated with the power button which is on the right side of the phone beneath the volume rockers, and is as responsive and accurate as expected.On the left side of the phone is a 'smart key' (button) that you can use to initiate up to three different actions such as: screen shot; start recording; open an app.I've gotten some pretty good pictures although I haven't tested the 'night mode' yet. There are standard and 'pro' shooting modes along with HDR and some different filters to enhance your shots and selfies.I still don't know how Umidigi continues to roll out mid-range performing phones and feature sets at bottom-tiered pricing."
4,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Bought this specifically for the NFC and WIFI calling capability. Only after I bought it did I find out it would not work with both my endoscope and Flir thermal USB cameras. Interestingly the Flir camera actually connects and is visible in the program but then immediately disconnects and terminates the program.  This obviously indicates the phone is capable of the connection and appears to be ""coded"" or programmed to terminate camera operation. When I contacted the seller they said the camera will not work and is not supposed to. Thus four stars."
5,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I got this phone I liked the phone however it was a 3G phone which most companies no longer support it is not a 5G phone which it is listed under  please change the wording on this phone

Â For the price I paid the phone has everything that I need without breaking the bank. It features a large screen, plenty of storage (128gb) and generous amount of ram (6gb). For this price point I had been looking at phones with 4gb ram and 64gb storage.When first turning on the phone I went through the setup quickly. The fingerprint reader is a must have and I set three fingers with ease. Unlocking the phone with my fingerprint is seamless each time without hesitation. I went to the OTA updates and updated the phone right out of the box, took a few minutes and everything was good to go.Having Voice over LTE and Voice over WiFi is great, it helps the call clarity and VoWiFi for when I'm in a poor reception area. Dual SIM is nice so I can use my personal and work line both on the same phone. You can disable the second SIM when not needed (so my work calls don't come in after hours).The 6.7"" screen makes things very easy to read and view. Playing games works very well for the screen size. It would be nice to have a faster refresh rate but I didn't expect this in the price bracket.The processor, gpu and ram make for a smooth experience for everyday use and handled all my gaming tasks without hesitation.The camera takes good pictures but the response time seems a bit sluggish when moving the phone around. But in all fairness I had compared this to my wife's phone which is the S22 and cost over $1000.The battery is quite large and lasts me a few days with work, games and day to day activities before I need to charge it up.Overall I'm quite pleased with my purchase. Getting the features that I need, and performance that I feel will last me a few years if not more before I feel the need to upgrade."
7,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I come from Blu G90 Pro and wow with 6GB of ram makes a big difference performance. Screen is bright clear video. Game is not too bad but Helio G90 can tell difference in game. Great phone if your looking for clean android user interface. Umidigi F3S is speedy.
8,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Phone is great for the price and nice looking.  So far it works fine.  Great that it has large storage size.  Camera quality is not very sharp.  Maybe need to adjust setting.
9,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Overall an excellent phone for the price with some nice features that exceed the price tag. Phone is very similar to other phones classified as mid end phones.The box comes with a charger, USB type C cable, pre-installed screen protector and phone case. The phone has a good macro camera with a screen that exceeded my expectations for the price tag. Also the 6GB of RAM and the ability to lock apps makes it really easy to multi task. There are 2 key features that exceed the price tag of this phone. First, NFC which is something I need in any phone in order to use Google Pay or scan my house and car keys. Second, the Smart Key which is an extra button on the left side of the phone which is also customizable (see pics).Cons:The single speaker is loud enough but coumd be a little more clear."
10,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The Umidigi F3s runs lag free, The battery is exceptional, it gives me about a day and a half of use, The camera takes vibrant and well detailed photos, the phone display is bright and good at it's price point. There is 6gb ROM and 128gb of RAM enough storage for all your apps, photos, videos and music. I also like the fact that it's dual sim. Overall it's a great phone at it's price point making it well worth the money."
11,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Everything good, maden with care, packed with accessories and most handy: 3 in 1 programmable button I use for telegram, teams and flashlight."

Â It's hard to find a reasonably priced phone with good features, but this one seems to come through in a lot of areas while still keeping the price pretty low. 128 GB storage, 6 GB ram, 5,000+ mAh battery... It's hard to complain about this phone! The multifunction button is the cherry on top for this new budget offering from Umidigi."
13,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Nice product with good capture and navigation.
14,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I pick this phone and was told it works on the Verizon network. But it doesn't.
15,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I have had it with my Umidigi Power 3 phone! I absolutely will never buy another product from them. From the first it did NOT work as it should on the most basic of functions of a cell phone---making a phone call! (the sound was barely audible on phone calls even at highest level with using speaker I had to yell at all times when making a call). This occurred as soon as I activated this phone. The screen then cracked shortly thereafter from a very SMALL drop of say 3 feet from my back pocket onto the kitchen floor (linoleum tile). I got my money back though. Maybe their newer phones are better...but I just wish someone warned me about Umidigi cell phones as I researched and believed the hype....what do I have now? a motorola and it too is a brand I will never buy again... its got a bad chip issue which makes ghost calls and the  ringer works only when it wants to.....

30,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Update: 4g stopped connecting and their customer support is a joke. First impossible to contact then impossible to get any answers.Considering prices inflation these days, you will be having a very hard finding a phone that cam do pretty much everything a top liner would do. The price starts at 240$ tax so imagine when they are on a promotion, the price would be even better.First of all the design is beautiful, I mean the colors and the glass back panel. I am not a big fan of iphone like cameras arrangement but that is fine. The front screen has just a small dot on top which serves as a camera.Some people complain about connectivity when they insert a sim card but I havent experiences anything similar. I would suggest to read the manual carefully and contact the seller, I am pretty sure it could be figures out.The fund works as a charm, it has a prety good battery capacity and it allows it to last for around whole day. Depending on usage of course. The camera doesnt take the best shots but they are still decent. Remember the price and lower your expectations. It allows you to surf internet, play games, do your work, listen to music, study, etc. And all that with ease"
31,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The overall design of the phone is really good. I bought the blue version and it's as in the picture. The phone came in a yellow box with a cable, adapter and papers (also a sim card remover).The phone itself is really powerful because it never lags. it has 6 gb ram and a lot of storage (128gb).As you can also see in the pictures the camera is really good, it takes realistic photos and especially with vif colors.Finally the battery serve well because it's quite big (5150 mah).The phone has also nfc which is great.In short, it's a good phone for pretty much anything : gaming, social networks, youtube, photo shooting..."
32,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I took to my retailer buddy to program. He deals in pricey phones was impressed with this one .can't go wrong
33,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The phone is good, it's built well and the screen is bright and comes with, a free silicone case. I don't have much complaints but I did exchange it and got a premium device that is better suited for my needs"
34,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,For the price it works perfectly. I'm on Bell and calls and data work awesome. Comes with a clear plastic case as well as a preinstalled screen protector.
35,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"there's a bit issue about the phone, but customer service was great and they help me resolve it.amazing battery life and great phone for the price"

37,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,No complaints so far.
38,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Lors de la premiÃ¨re utilisation le tÃ©lÃ©phone me semblais bien cependant a la premiÃ¨re charge il n'a mÃªme pas charger au complet et un message d'erreur est afficher
39,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"My wife needed a new phone, as hers was acting up and being unreliable. So I came across this brand, as I remember reading good things about the brand, and reading many reviews and studying the specs. On paper this seems to be a good phone, much better than the Motorola one that my wife wanted to get from Costco for $200. After researching the phone for a while, I decided to order it and give it a try, shipping was fast and arrived the next evening. Opened the box, set up the phone, transfering everything over from the old phone was a breeze. That's where it stopped being a great phone. It couldn't stay connected to WiFi, constantly disconnected without my wife noticing this caused her to go way over her mobile data limit and resulted in a nice extra on the phone bill. Next, call quality was very bad, person on the other end of phone would hear a computerized like voice, with constant cut outs making calls and conversations hard to have. Lastly the camera which is supposed to be 48MP was very grainy/blurry, and the zoom was only 2x which make the picture quality worse.It's too bad since it is a very nice looking phone, maybe I got a lemon, but maybe not. Anyways I returned it after a week of using it without any issues with the return. Didn't want to take a chance and exchange it for another unit."
40,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"UMIDIGI F3SI spotted this phone and was impressed with the specs to price point.It has a 48 MP camera on the back which takes really nice pictures. I haven't had a chance to take any night pics yet but think that will be good as well. The front camera takes nice selfie pics as wellAndroid 11, lots of internal storage and a spot for an SD card as well.It also has a second sim slot which will come in handy on the next trip down south.I am writing this review on the phone right now and the screen is nice and sharp.I am looking forward to using this as my daily driver."

42,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Overall, definitely a phone worth it's price. It has good storage and RAM, great battery life, and the 48 mp camera is fantastic. The phone is slimmer and longer than some other phones, allowing it to fit better within my hand, without losing any screen size. The package includes not only the phone, but a simple clear case and a charger (USB Type-C). My one slight problem is some of the UI preferences that I have not been able change to my liking, but I will get used to those over time. As always, UMIDIGI has given me a phone that I very much enjoy with a very affordable price."
43,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"So far I love it! Very smooth, very fast.  Light weight but not too light where it feels plastic. Audio is good, very clear. Could have a little more bass but not complaining. Pictures are actually excellent. I'm comparing them to my iphone 12 Pro. I'll see how the battery life is but so far its good too. The next thing I would hope to see is wireless charging for this. Comes with its own phone case. But overall, this is an amazing phone for a great price."
44,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Jâ€™ai commander ce Umidigi comme telephone de backup, mais il mâ€™as beaucoup surpris. Performance / prix trÃ¨s intÃ©ressant. Sont seul point faible est la qualitÃ© des photos. Fonctionnel, mais loin dâ€™un iPhone. Jâ€™en suis satisfait et je recommande!"
45,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I bought one of these in August and like it so much that I bought my wife one. Great camera on it. It holds a lot of apps and runs all of them great. Lots of memory in it too. I would put it up against other phones that are in the 500-600 dollar range..
46,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The F3S with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage is a nice step up from the A13S I was previously using. The apps are snappier, able to handle more open apps at once.I know this is a cost effective phone, but my only drawback is the slow response of the screen. You can see the refresh rate while scrolling through facebook and Instagram, but I'm also spoiled with my Pixel 6. The screen is bright, the face unlock is great.I noticed that this F3S supports dual sim, but you have to sacrifice the microSD slot, where as the A13S has both sims and a MicroSD. But with the 128GB you likely won't need the SD anyway.The camera is much better, with the Sony 48MP lens. Still a bit of a lag between button press and shutter though.Again, comes with a silicon case and screen protector pre-installed. Love this.All in all a decent phone. I would recommend."
47,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Ce tÃ©lÃ©phone a plusieurs qualitÃ©s :-lÃ©ger-plusieurs choix de couleur-bel Ã©cran qui est assez lumineux pour la lecture en plein soleil-Android en version Ã©purÃ©e-trÃ¨s bonne camÃ©ra pour le prix du tÃ©lÃ©phone-chargeur et Ã©tui fournisQuelques points Ã  mentionner :Le bouton option est placÃ© de faÃ§on Ã  ce quâ€™on puisse lâ€™utiliser pour des commandes usuelles comme une capture dâ€™Ã©cran.

49,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"This is the 3rd Umidgi phone I have purchased over the years. The other two were a Bison and F2 and this was my least favorite of the 3. The phone has a lot of good things going for it spec wise but it was just buggy.PositivesGreat BatteryGood CameraLarge ScreenComes with a case and screen protector includedStock AndroidNegativesBluetooth calls drop every 30 secondsThe speakerphone didn't workThe screen protector was starting to have bubbles on the screen after the first dayRandomly freezeMaybe I had received a faulty product, but in its current state, I would have a tough time recommending this phone until the bugs are fixed."
50,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"My last phone was a Samsung A10e, and anyone coming from a cheap A series phone can for sure tell you that this is a MAJOR upgrade. I got the 128gb S21 FE model and I only paid $590 USD for the black version, despite really really wanting the white version, yet that one was priced at $699 USD. Would I pay $699 for it? Probably not, but everyone has a different budget for everything!When I received the phone, it came in its regular factory box which is very thin, like I was concerned for a second that they just sent me a case, but nope! They've cut down on everything that they send you. It came with the phone, a manual in a tiny box, a sim card tool behind that box, and I believe short type c cable, I already have a charging cable so I didn't pay any attention to it. Not that big of a deal really, it just worried me for a second haha.Now I'm someone who worries about storage, and this phone does NOT come with a micro SD card slot (unlike the S20 FE), however I've not had any problems with my storage yet, I still have roughly 61GB out of the 128GB to go. The system itself is 22.5GB which is expected as this is a very beefy and fast machine, and then I play a lot of games so my apps take around 39GB. I don't take many photos either so I only have around 1GB used, but if you are someone who loves to take photos, I recommend getting a separate portable hard drive or even using your personal computer to send your photos over, as spending $70-$130+ for just 128GB of more storage is a lot when you could use that to get around 500GB on a standalone drive. It is also worth mentioning that getting the bigger storage version for this phone, also adds 2GB of ram to it, giving it a speed boost, but I'm about to go over some things about the phone's speed.As for game wise, I play Genshin Impact, Colorful Stage/Project Sekai, Stardew Valley, Pokemon GO, and Fallout Shelter, and this thing runs them all like a BEAST. I wouldn't recommend getting the extra 2GB of ram in the bigger storage model since this phone can run pretty much anything you throw at it. Anyone who's ever played Genshin Impact knows how heavy the game is, and it can run it at max settings just fine, the only problem, is that it gets INCREDIBLY hot. So hot that it lowkey hurts to touch after playing for more than just 5-15 minutes. This could be completely fixed if you get a cooling mount for around $20-30. I do prioritize game functionality and speed over looks so I do play extremely comfortably in low-medium settings as it still looks great! However if you're looking for a gaming machine with smooth fps and no lag at all with maximum settings on heavy games (since bigger temperatures means lowering the processing of your game, causing lag), I'll have to recommend looking for a different phone such as an Iphone or a Oneplus since they do that well.The camera is good for me! I take photos of my dog and that's it. It also has a 30x zoom which is crazy. The front camera is really good and I sometimes put it up to my head and angle it to make myself look like a goldfish and it's super funny haha. The fingerprint reader works extremely well even with a screen protector. Fun fact I found: you can lay your finger over your fingerprint reader while the screen is off and it'll unlock! So you don't even have to double tap your screen to wake it up or press a power button. I was never a fan of 120hz screens and I still am not, but it looks super smooth when I have it turned on. The AMOLED screen was a huge game changer for me, it's beautiful and has incredible contrasting colors. I know people say they have tons of issues with the battery to this device, but I honestly haven't had any problems whatsoever. Now I do keep medium power saving mode on as I just don't see too much to the use of allowing your phone to do any big background services when you're not using it. It lasts about a day and a half. I work 9-5 and I come home with 70% battery after being on it or checking it very often and frequently. Now I will say there has been some connectivity issues during heavy storms and heavy storms only, but I experienced that issue with my last phone so there's a massive chance that's just my mobile data provider (which is US Cellular). By the way, this phone is unlocked, so it should be able to accept just about any other provider you use. I also think it supports 2 sim cards? I'm not too sure as I'm not someone who would ever have to use it, but if you are, then that's a plus.Overall this phone is absolutely amazing and I 11/10 recommend it :)"
51,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Update - 9/15/22I have not received any security updates (August should have been out, by now, September was just released, but my phone is still on the July patch the phone shipped with). I am not sure why this is, and unlike a Pixel phone, there is no way to force/sideload a security patch. In the same timeframe, my S20FE did receive the August patch. I am holding off for now and hoping this is a fluke, but if I don't receive the September update by October, this may indicate an issue with phone itself.Update - 8/9/22After going caseless for a couple of days - both on wifi almost exclusively one day and on 4G LTE another - the case was likely the issue. Both tests resulted in a warm, not heated phone after heavy usage and over 6 hours of screen on time. The Spigen thin hybrid was the same case I had for my S20FE, except this one was not the ""clear"" option. I am not sure if the hard type of plastic on the back did not displace heat well with this phone model or if something in the non-clear cases are made with a material that interferes with RF signals, but that case was returned and a cheap, all-TPU case was purchased. Screen on time has continued to improve from the barely 5 hours before to 6.5-7 with the same usage now. As such, I have added one star to my review. I still encounter ghost touches and I am not sure how much of an improvement the case change has been to signal strength, but this has gone from an underwhelming experience to a solid option for those that can get a good deal on it.Original review below:I have bought and used both an S20 FE (6 RAM/128 ROM) in 2021 and an S21 FE (8 RAM/256 ROM) on Prime Day in 2022. While the S20 FE ended up being almost the perfect phone for the past year, the S21 FE was not worth it, even at Amazon's great price.S21 FE Pros1. Slightly smaller than the S20 FE, and I found it easier to handle - a few millimeters makes a huge difference here.2. Camera was excellent as every other Samsung phone I have owned has been.3. Phone had the July 5th Android update waiting to download when I received the phone in mid July. My S20 FE was about a month behind on monthly patches (probably due to Samsung prioritizing newer phones).4. Solid construction - Like the S20 FE, I have no worries of this getting bent, punctured, or damaged from compression, as I have experienced on some phones. As with just about every other phone I have owned, I have a TPU case on it to prevent fall damage.S21 FE Cons1. Battery life. A little about my settings: after doing all updates, I factory reset the phone to have a ""clean"" install. Downloaded all apps and then turned auto brightness and NFC off, only have bluetooth on when in the car, screen set to 60hz refresh, 5G off, and mostly on fiber-connected WiFi at home. On my S20 FE, this could get me 9 hours on-screen time for one charge easily. The same settings on the S21 FE barely eek out 5 hours with a slightly smaller screen and the same battery size. Not sure if this is a bad android security update (which will prompt an addendum to this review next month) or the phone itself. But underwhelming after 2 weeks of usage.2. Possibly tied to the battery - it seems a lot warmer than my S20 FE ever got when using for long periods of time. Will be using without a case at home to see if that is part of the issue or not.3. Connectivity - I wouldn't say there are rampant issues per se, but it does not seem to have the signal strength when using 4G LTE when out and about. Again, the case may be a factor here, and will be using without for a couple days.4. Ghost touches - have had odd things happen with active on display stopping music, or tapping one area of the screen to open an app and something else entirely launches.At this point, this was not worth the upgrade for my use case, and I probably should have just bought another S20 FE instead. My phones get full usage daily, and it is just a matter of time before the S20 FE's battery starts to take a hit. However, with the charge I get out of the S21 FE, I probably could have stuck with my current S20 FE for quite some time."
52,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I got my S9 after my S4 crapped out after 5 years (screen went off, wasn't even cracked).  My S4 & S9 served me very well!  I had the S9 for 4+ years it simply is an amazing phone.  I was at a crowded place, and someone knocked my elbow while holding it.  It fell, and the screen cracked pretty bad (not like one crack, many cracks).  Screen still works perfectly, but, I was scared it could stop working at any time.  So, I needed a new phone.  I looked at the S21 FE and S22.  At the time I purchased, the prices were about $200 different (then a week after I purchased, prices were the same!).  But, I'm happy with my purchase.  I liked small phones in the past, never had a bigger one.  I am actually enjoying the larger screen.  Better for viewing content.  I'm a guy and my pants pockets are plenty large for this phone as well.  Feels no different than my previous S9 in my pocket.  I've watched a lot of YouTube reviews of the camera / video quality / test pics and footage, and it seems they are almost the same (sometimes I prefer and think the S21 FE image / video looks better, others the S22 looks better - kind of a toss up).So, what have I noticed?  Well, battery life is amazing!  Beats my S9 by FAR!  Now, my S9 was 4+ years old when I had to replace it (now use the S9 as a ""camera I'm not worried about losing or breaking"").  I had the S9 for a long time, and I cannot remember how good battery life was when I first got it.  But, I don't recall it ever getting worse either.  What I can say is, I used to have to top my S9 up a bit at least once or twice a day.  My S21 FE, lasts ALL DAY (and I even have the battery saver setup so it only charges to 85% - never did that with the S9).  And even from 85%, I get a full day no problem!  Usually around 35% or so when I am ready for bed.  The screen is great.  I do leave on 120hz mode all the time.  I also have dark mode turned on.  I like how it looks, and dark things on screen use less battery than bright white things.  But yes, battery is great.Now the cameras.  My S9 actually had almost identical video.  I make YouTube videos and the S9 did me very well in 4K by 30 or 60.  I do notice the S21 FE is ever so slightly better image.  It also has better stabilization and just some other processing stuff that helps out.  The pictures are better for sure.  I've taken pictures of people and shown them, and they've been like, ""What phone is that?!?  The pictures are sooooo good!""  The S9 did well.  But, the S21 FE is for sure an improvement.  I used to use my G7X Mark ii for most pictures, because it just was better by far than my S9.  Now, I don't think I ever really need that camera anymore.  This phone produces awesome photos!I haven't had a single issues, no glitches, no nothing.  Just a smooth perfectly working phone.  I did kind of like the S9 having the fingerprint reader on the back.  But, I quickly got used to the in screen reader.  It works fast and great.  Apps load fast.  Camera is on in an instant with a double tap of the power button.  Just really nothing to complain about.  I would have kept my S9 another few years, but, I am happy with the S21 FE and hope it lasts me 5+ years as well.Great phone, if you are looking into it and deciding if you want to get it, I for sure recommend it."
53,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I believe, it is one of the best deals available for a new, established brand name, Android phone. My son got one of these first, I got one for myself half a year later, and recently we got one for my wife. The reasons which we like this phone are as follows:1) It still accepts SD cards (newer Samsung phones do not). You can add 256 GB of flash memory for pictures and video for $30. The same upgrade of memory with the latest Samsung phone models would cost you about $200 (they charge at least $100 per 128 GB of built-in flash - a street robbery!). If you need more memory, you can plug in SD card with capacity up to 1 TB. You can store huge number of movies on it.2) It comes with a charger. An extra charger never hurts. This is a slow 15 W charger, but it does its job - charges the phone over about 2-3 hours. I usually leave it plugged in overnight.3) This phone has a very good, for a smart phone, battery life. With active use through the day, the battery comfortably lasts through the day. If the phone used only for phone calls and occasional e-mail checks, the battery will last for two days or longer.4) Cameras work quite well. Resolution is good, image quality is good. The phone has three camers with different focal length, plus front side camera. Perfectly sufficient for all reasonable uses.5) The screen is big, but not excessively huge. The phone is just right size to fit into the hand comfortably.6) We use it on ATT prepaid plan. It is fully compatible with ATT Wireless and is fully supported.7) It is nominally 5G, but this in reality translates into more DRAM and a little better camera and nothing more. There is no true 5G in the U.S. (thankfully - I do not want to carry a microwave source next to my body!). If you go to ATT web page, you will learn that there are three flavors of 5G, the first two of them are nothing but marketing tricks.  AT&T 5G using low-band spectrum reaches more than 277 million people in more than 18,000 cities and towns in the U.S. This is slightly upgraded 4G LTE. There is nothing 5G in it. This is what you get from all major carriers, sold to you as ""5G"". It is just a little bit faster than regular 4G.  AT&T 5G+ using recently introduced C-Band spectrum sits between our other two bands and provides a great combination of ultra-fast speeds and wide geographic coverage. This has very little availability, and it is still not true 5G yet.  AT&T 5G+ using millimeter wave spectrum delivers super-fast speeds and unprecedented performances in high traffic areas including parts of more than 40 cities and more than 40 stadiums and venues. Availability of this is extremely limited in very limited selection of places, pretty much, nowhere.8) All three S20 FE phones in our family so far have been working very well, they are solid, reliable, and well made.The downsides are few. One, I am missing a headphone jack. I have a couple of Boise noise cancelling headphones (no BT) which I would like to be able to connect. With this phone, I need a USB-C to headphone jack adapter to accomplish it. $10 - $15 is not a big deal, but it is very easy to lose.  Second downside, this phone still has that useless, annoying Bixby, but it got less annoying compared to my old phone. Finally, there are very few pre-installed apps and very little work is needed to clean them up.I do not play games on the phone, so I cannot judge if it is good for gaming. Probably, for latest games one needs the newest, fastest phone. For youtube or movies stored on the phone, it works perfectly well.  The screen has good resolution and is silky smooth, at 120 Hz.I am convinced, it is a great phone to get in the Android family, as long as it is available."
54,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I bought this phone on a Black Friday discount. The phone is really good, very snappy camera and taking amazing pictures. The device size is just a sweet spot I think, it is not as small as 6.1 inches and not as big as 6.7 inches. this phone is 6.4 inches, something that I liked about it.I wouldn't pay an unreasonably full price of around $700 for this as I could buy newer Samsungs (from flagship series) with the better camera and better hardware but this phone with the discounted price is just what it should've been priced initially. Used this phone few days now, nothing to complain about, just an amazing phone!"
55,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for my smartphone upgrade for a lot of reasons. One, and most obviously, was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it), it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so, I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance, the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen, while not 4K, still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good, nice and crisp. I've done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography, all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid, but not the best in the market right now. You'll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also, you can't beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support), you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size, while much larger than I was used to, still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though, as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But, if you've been reading up on the S20 FE at all, then you know that there are problems. First off, the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself, I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls, that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I'd say it works about 85% of the time, but when it doesn't, do you ever feel it. Adding on, the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad, but it's not flagship levels by any stretch. You'll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you're looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with, I'd look elsewhere.From what I've seen, the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes, my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There's undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released, but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no, at least for me. While I'm sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers), I really haven't noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter, but that's about all I've seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE, I don't blame you.It really is a shame that I can't give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars, because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues, there's always the worry that time will make them worse. It's a genuine worry, I get that. But even with the problems, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone, but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse, but for right now, I'm more than happy with it.Edit (8/18/2021): I've dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.It's been a little less than a year, and the issues mentioned above have started to affect daily use in a way that turns this from a great phone to an okay phone not worth your time. Okay, maybe not daily use, per se. But enough that it's starting to effect my initial thoughts on it.The amount of times this phone has turned on in my pocket because of ghost touches is insane. Every time I take it out of my pocket, it's opened a random app and input a few letters on the keyboard. And this is after adjusting the settings to stop these sorts of things. I turned off double tap to turn on (despite wanting that feature) and turned on accidental touch protection (which did absolutely nothing). I even made it so that the phone needed face recognition or a fingerprint to unlock every time I close it. But it just keeps happening. No software update really fixed the screen, as suspected. This is a pure hardware messup.Here's the cold, honest truth: the screen on the S20 FE is terrible. Worse than my old S7. Worse than even a budget android phone's screen. It's beyond comprehension. The virtual proximity sensor is also worthless. I almost want to give it the classic ""angry Amazon customer 1-star"" review, but I'll refrain. There's still good here with the chip, customizability, and great battery life, but that stuff can only get you so far.Here's my advice: don't bother with this phone. You can get a midrange smartphone for the same (or even a lower) price, with better specs. It's still not the worst thing out there and I'm not tossing it in the trash just yet, but it's definitely the last Samsung product I'll be buying. So disappointing, but I couldn't keep this review a 4-star in good conscience."
56,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Was a bit hesitant about buying a phone through Amazon but I'm so glad I did! Not only did Amazon have the best price but it did not disappoint. I also added on the protection plan at a good price.  Battery life is good and that's with me using my phone all day for emails,  social media,  etc... If you're debating on buying a phone from Amazon this is your sign... buy the phone!"
57,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"No battery charger included.  Real bummer!  New connections on the S21 require newer charging cables.  Therefore, when my phone arrived with 6% battery could not prepare it for use.  Wireless charging in my vehicle was too slow.  Looking forward to using a fully charged phone.  Amazon description should have included this caveat."
58,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Now that the price on this phone has gone down to $600, it is a very good deal for the price.The Snapdragon 865 processor is more than fast enough for anything I want to do. 6GB of memory is less than some other phones in this price range, but it is still more than enough for most people.The phone feels very solid despite the plastic back. If you use any kind of case, you won't even notice the plastic back.The phone supports 25W fast charging, but for some reason they only included a 15W charger in the box. Buying the 25W charger separately is a waste of money as well as a waste of the natural resources that were used on the 15W charger. Amazon sells decent 25W fast chargers for less than $15, so cheaping out on the charger is a real lame move by Samsung. You can search Amazon for 15W chargers that support ""USB-C PPS"" mode and are UL Certified.The screen looks beautiful when you turn on the 120Hz mode. This does burn your battery more quickly, but the battery is big enough that it still lasts all day.The screen has been very responsive to me. I have read bug reports about screen glitches for some people. Samsung has already released bug fixes that hopefully have fixed this. I advise only buying this phone from an authorized dealer with no hassle returns so you don't have to worry about this bug.The phone does have a lot of Samsung bloatware. I owned a Samsung S-series phone several years ago and the bloatware was really bad then. This one is much better. You don't even need to create a Samsung account to use the phone now. Most of the Samsung bloatware (other than the camera app) won't work if you don't have a Samsung account, but if you never use it, this isn't a problem. There are several tutorials online about disabling all the bloatware if you never want to see any of it on your screen.The triple camera setup on this phone is very good for this price level. The telephone camera works great up to 3X in good light. Image quality deteriorates quickly if you zoom in past 3X or in lower lighting conditions. Telephoto cameras are getting rare in this smartphone price range, so I'm glad this phone has one. I really like using the telephoto lens for landscape and nature photography. The normal and wide angle cameras work better in lower light situations (including indoor situations), though not as good as the iphone or Google Pixel phones. Pictures do tend look more processed than with some other phone cameras. Some people like the Samsung look. Other people prefer more natural looking photos. You should try to look at sample photos before buying the phone, since you cannot completely disable the Samsung photo processing.This phone comes with Android version 10 out of the box, which is one version behind the Android version 11 that the Google Pixel phones are shipping with. Samsung promises software support with 3 version updates, but that is a little misleading since 1 of those version updates will be just to catch up with the current Android version 11. Still, 3 years of bug fixes and security patches is better than what Samsung used to offer."
59,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"This is my second SAMSUNG Galaxy S21 FE 5G Cell Phone.  My first one had problems that two different experts could not solve, so I sent that one back to Amazon and got a replacement that works great."
60,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Edit: I'm a super heavy user.  I'm at about the 6 month, and now the device gets warm when it's taxed or the weather is a little warm.  And the battery life, whuch is still great, and dropped down significantly.  Love the phone.  Very concerned about the longevity. Particularly as i come up on summer in floridamark Edit:  one month in, and I love it!  Battery lasts all day, and I'm on my phone nonstop.I'm used to the change in buttons and actually like them.  Put in settings so power options do come up now. Like the screenshot method, mostly.Got a supcase military grade unicorn beetle case so it's well protected.  Signal is great on tmobile.  5g is slower than 4g, so I turn it off.  but I'm out in the middle of nowhere.Touch screen works perfectly even under double acreen protectors!  Updates get sent all the time.  So worth it!And my mom is blown away by the telephoto lens.  For me it's a fun binoculars, but pretty mushy picture quality at telephoto distance.  S9 couldn't do that at all. The close up distance/focus is much better than my s9.  The rest is pretty similar.---It's only been a couple days but so far so good. None of the touch screen or overheating issues a few people listed on the internet.I took very good care of my S9, but it was overheating often. This is night and day difference.I thought the volume buttons above the power button would take some getting used to, but actually the only downside is taking a screenshot is more difficult. Oh, and the power button no longer turns it off! Although I've read There are some workarounds for that. Otherwise you have to go up in the menu.I love that it's the same width as my old phone, but taller. Gives me more space but I can still hold it.I absolutely hate that there are no good colorful heavy duty cases out for it yet. Come on OtterBox!I wanted to go with the S10 because I was nervous reading reviews, and how new this was. But this was cheaper, and so far I'm very happy with my choice.Please note, red it definitely an orangey red.  I went with red so it would be more visible if all I could find for now was transparent cases. But if I could go back I would definitely choose purple again.I've also read a lot of people turn the 5G off because it's not available everywhere and you don't really want it constantly switching between 4G and 5G. 5G was coming in pretty good for me out in the boonies with T-Mobile. I did switch it to 4G yesterday and that also worked fine during a trip.Transferring information using Smart Switch actually worked really well for me. My S9 main Drive was completely full.  The SD card was half full. This brought over ALMOST everything perfectly, and it wasn't even very slow.  The only things it didn't bring over were  paid apps that I had installed with a different Google account. I had to add the rest of my Google accounts and do those by hand. Not sure if that would have been any different had I installed all the Google accounts first.I would say it's very slightly brighter than my S9. I don't have a problem with the camera being on the screen.Haven't had great luck with a fingerprint yet, but I do need to redo it since I put a screen protector on anyways.Happy happy!"
61,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I bought this phone for my mom, she is so happy with her phone, huge internal storage, amazing Camara, light, super fast to navigate in it"
62,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Read all the bad reviews. 2yrs later, knock on wood, phone still please wife.Strong connectivity.Fast for her useage.Awesome photos, and good assortment of photo taking options like 2x optical zoom camera, slow motion video, etc...Extra memory chip to store all those photos and videos. When its full, just but a new chip in.Highly recommend."
63,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"The CPU is fast and the phone has enough RAM to the point where your phone doesn't freeze up opening certain apps. The storage space is generous and the SD card slot area is pretty dope as well. It may seem inconvenient, unless you're upgrading from an android phone that had a back piece where you could take out the battery. The camera shoots in 4K and allows you to focus on an object.For those of you who don't know what 4K is, think 4K HD a certain adult film companies uses cameras of this quality, lmao.The price is reasonable, especially for all the features, storage space, RAM and other specs that this phone has. The camera is on par with most newer iPhones if not better. It's approximately as big as the iPhone 13 Pro Max and faster. I've tested this out personally. The Samsung FE series is quite a refreshing experience. It's well worth the price.Oh ANOTHER THING. If you like decent headphones, this phone sports a newer version of bluetooth connectivity. It will have better connection to wireless earbuds, wireless headphones, smart TVs, bluetooth speakers, cars that support bluetooth, etc.The colors are of a nice variety and the display is beautiful. You can watch videos in 4K quality. It is also, a legit pro gamer phone. No game I've played has ever lagged. The download speed is pretty impressive as well.Overall, if you prefer Samsung phones or great phones at reasonable prices, then I'd recommend this phone via Amazon.The best function is the Bluetooth tethering. You can share your phone's wifi/data with another device WITHOUT it using your mobile hotspot data AND WITHOUT being charged. You can even charge another Qi compatible device off this phone or charge this phone off a Qi compatible device.I apologize for the rant, lol.Also, so far as of June 2022, this is the last high end Samsung phone with a micro SD card slot.You also power off the phone differently. You don't need to hold the ""power button"" on the side of the device. Screenshots are also different. You hold the ""power button"" and the volume down button at the same time for one second.This phone can also block Apple ID. These crazy females won't be calling me from different phone numbers anymore at 3am in the morning!"
64,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"However, the sim card tray had to be replaced.  In the description for the open box option, it stated something along the lines of it's been handled, some signs of wear.  Benign enough.  However, the sim card tray was bent and that had to be replaced.  NOT AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION when the seller promoted the open box.  All in all, the open box price was still a great option even with the additional $11 we had to spend on the new card tray.  So far, the phone is performing well and suits my husbands needs."
65,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,This Samsung GS21FE 5G is the fastest and most detailed cell I've had...We like them a lot and the battery last about 10 hours of continued use.
66,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"PROS- runs fast and never freezes or crashes (have owned for 7 months)- plenty of space and not overpowered by bloatwire as I though it might be (got 256 verison fyi)- NFC works great and I've loved this feature (coming before from phones without it)- customizable fonts, displays, screens- great call quality, multi-tasking on phone between apps, and was easy to set up- good size and weight- camera is beautiful! I have taken some really great photos with this and gotten so many colors/details. Also love the features and the modes.- 5G phone (happen to live in an area where I get some of this lol)CONS- battery at first (I had to switch to 60 hz display and now I get basically a full day/8-10 hrs)- no headphone jack- sometimes the pull out side draws are hard to pull out with touch- adaptive brightness didn't work well/anytime I'm outside I have to turn it up quite a bit- the photos and screenshots all save to the same place, so I have to sort through to get to my pictures sometimes and selectively import photos to google (serious hassle, but that's just how Samsung has it set up)OTHER- honestly, from the moment I bought it, I forgot how long I had it and had zero regrets after purchase. VERY HAPPY and will definitely buy another samsung (pending reviews) when I want to upgrade phones again . . .  though I have a feeling this one will last a while.- Would definitely still recommend this phone! :)"
67,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I never buy the latest thing. Too expensive.But this was on sale for Prime Day and a very good deal. I was upgrading from a Samsung S10e with a battery that was starting to get really low on charged time and some apps were getting glitchy and kept crashing.Since this was on sale, I decided it was time to upgrade on a four and half year old phone. Saved $180 on Prime Day. Much cheaper than if I bought it from my service provider. I can only compare it to my previous phones but this is a very noticeable improvement in quality and operation.It works well, quicker and a little smoother operating than the S10e. In switching sim card to this phone, there were no glitches for the service provider, Consumer Cellular. I play a lot of games. and the apps are running without crashing anymore and it works well. Battery is solid not great, but a definite upgrade from my previous Samsung. Display is sharper and a bigger screen which means a better viewing experience for my old eyes. Setting up the fingerprint security has improved greatly since I last bought. Much quicker and easier. Haven't really pushed the camera yet, but even after moving my pictures from my old phone, looking at those older pictures is better on this phone. A definite and noticeable upgrade.Overall pleased with this phone. More pleased with the deal."
68,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"The battery goes down quickly, Phone  is  charged  in the morning  100% by the time i get to work for 8:30 it's down to 52% just listening  to music, my older phone  holds  charged  way longer"
69,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I just received this phone and was disappointed to discover there is no charging block. It comes with a USB C to USB C male to male cable. All of my charging blocks accept a standard USB A cable so I have no way to charge it without purchase a new one. I have had difficulties in the past finding USB chargers manufactured by Samsung and I would like one with the correct specifications for my phone.The description page does have a section that says ""What's in the box?"", however it only says TBD. Guess I learned my lesson on that.Also I was not notified of delivery like I am with nearly every delivery so this phone sat out on my front porch for nearly 24 hours before I noticed. Thankfully it did not get stolen but it was sitting out in wet weather.I have yet to activate or use the phone, since I cannot charge it but may change my rating once I find an appropriate charger."

71,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I purchased a Samsung S21 to replace my Samsung S10 Lite that the screen cracked on and was starting to have a few technical glitches.  After using the new S21 for a few days I can almost live with my old glitches and cracked screen.  For a brand new phone this battery drains QUICKLY.  I am already going to be ordering another fast charging port so that I can get through the day at work AND the evening before charging it fully at night.  Another feature that isn't working is the face recognition.  That isn't a deal breaker for me since I am content using the fingerprint option, but something I've noticed just the same and wanted to mention in case you relied on it.I have had LOTS of Samsung phones and am always happy with them, but this one misses the mark a bit for me mainly due to battery life.  Since purchasing I have done a few tweaks that were mentioned like going to dark mode and restarting more to make sure I am rebooting once in awhile (which is something I rarely had to do on my S10).  I am hoping that makes a difference."
72,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Got this phone over a month ago to up grade from a S8. I live in Cape Coral Fl an as you know we just got hit by Ian which totally destroyed everything. This phone has been a god send. Got multiple calls in the eye of the storm and post storm. Id say sure its partially my carrier which is Metro PCS but I think it was also the phone or just a miracle. BUT I NEVER LOST CONTACT WITH MY FAMILY ONCE! thank you for making such a wonderful product.
73,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Phone charger not supplied with phone. Seems odd not to include an essential piece of equipment for the  function of phone.
74,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"The phone works well. It is a unlocked phone. My sim is not American based and I had no problems. GSM is one of the networks that is used, which the phone supports."
75,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Needed a new phone.  First, I bought the Galaxy S22+.  It got really hot and the battery drained so quickly.  Plus, the outrageous price.  So, I returned it.  Look around, read reviews, and I found this S21 FE 5G with 8gb Ram and 256gb memory.  Got it on a good deal on Amazon Prime Day  I love this phone.  Yes, it's an older model, with older Snapdragon 888 processor, and plastic back.  But with Snapdragon 888, the phone does not get hot, and the battery life last me more than a day.  And I use Spigen Rugged Armor case to keep the phone safe.  Therefore, whether it has a glass back or plastic back means nothing to me.  And it was half the price of the S22+.  This is a great alternative to the S22 series."
76,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"My Zenfone 6 died on me. Out of all the phones, this was the only one to offer most of the features the Zenfone 6 did.I needed a good battery, finger print scanner, expandable memory, snapdragon 8xx, 4k @60  video recording. This was the only one to offer these features.The only two features I was worried about were the battery life and finger print scanner.The battery life is great. Can easily get a day with moderate use and low screen brightness.I was skeptical about the onscreen finger scanner. I couldn't verify beforehand if I needed to turn on the screen to use the scanner. Thankfully the scanner can be activated with the screen off. It's very accurate and fast.The phone runs smooth. The cell signal is good. I use T-Mobile, and can get signal in most places.The only thing I still don't like about all Samsung phones is their custom UI. Will never prefer it over stock Android.Overall the phone is a great. Even now in mid 2022 there is no other better replacement for my Zenfone 6.I recommend the phone."
77,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Bought this White FE 25th March 2022 but started using some time in May and it took 3 months of using to realize that it is ACTUALLY DUAL SIM!!!  All along I thought that the sim tray having SIM1 and SIM2 on the flip side was a generic design.  It is odd because nothing on Amazon says dual sim but now checking GSM arena, it does indeed say dual sim stand-by.The only draw back for me is the caller ID. It only shows the contact is the number is stored EXACTLY as it shows if the contact calls you! Very frustrating seeing contacts numbers I have stored display as a plain NOT saved first time caller."
78,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Love my new phone and the colors they come in are beautiful. I haven't used the face recognition yet but the finger print reader works pretty well, maybe a few times were it didn't work. Battery life has been getting me thru a day of work and then some as well, so good Battery life in my opinion. Love this phone definitely recommendğŸ‘"
79,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,This phone far exceeded my expectations. The Android Play is great.  I can play Pandora and Waze on my car stereo from this phone.  I don't use the finger print or face recognition part but the battery lasts all day with plenty left over and i'm on it a lot...
80,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Update)After running the diagnosis, the local service center told me it was because the sim was not connecting to the network, which could be either due to faulty sim card, carrier software, or issue within the phone itself. I contacted my carrier and tries swapping the sim card in another phone, which shows that the sim was working fine. So I contacted samsung customer service again, they told me to send the phone over to repair it. After about a week, I have received the phone. The service statement says cause of problem was WPC FAILURE, and solution was S/W UPDATED. I got my phone back after a week, the software was updated and the phone was working fine so far. Hopefully there wont be any more issues in the near future.---------Purchased the S21fe early July this year, been having so much issue since purchased. I was unable to receive phone calls for over a month. Tried so many things to fix the issues. One day, I was able to receive phone calls after resetting everything, and thought the problem was finally resolved... I was wrong. Another issue popped up; the audio quality during phone call became so bad, the other side couldn't understand a single word I said. Then again, after the help from Samsung customer service, I was able to resolve that issue. While I thought everything was good.... I couldn't receive the phone call again!!! Have booked an appointment with a local service center, hopefully they can fix it. Aside from that, my phone still hasn't received the August security patch, it has been one month since the patch released.  It's been so frustrating trying to deal with the issue and having to worry about missing important calls. (Also can't return it, because I thought a software update would fix the problem and has been waiting and waiting, and 30 days has passed, issue still there)"
81,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Lots of storage very high tech
82,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Have had this phone for 18 months, its been dropped and never broke, battery still lasts all day and some when i watch alot of videos and games, cameras are great, size is perfect. Best phone for the price."
83,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I love my Galaxy S phone. It reminds me of my galaxy s9 I loved and missed so much.
84,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I replaced my S10 with this phone. No regrets! Display is vibrant and cameras are awesome. I use the phone to stream online. The battery doesn't last as long as I had hoped. That is the only shortfall.
85,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"This phone is solid. It's interesting that in 2020, a ""budget"" phone is 700 dollars but it is definitely a great value for the money. The cameras aren't as great as the regular S20 line up but they are a solid upgrade coming from the S8. Just make sure you have great lighting if you plan to use the ultra wide lens or telephoto because photos get very grainy in less than  ideal conditions. Battery life is solid. I work all week and when I'm not on my phone a lot, I easily get 2 days and squeeze  in a few hours from the next day if I really can't get to another charger. If I have a day off and I'm on the phone for hours,  I can easily make it to the end of the day at 20+ percent.The screen is great. Colors are bright and the quality 120 Hz refresh rate screen is buttery smooth to navigate. The phone is definitely bigger and closer to the Note 20 (non Ultra model) in terms of size so that takes some getting used to. Touch could be a bit better. Sometimes you have to touch the screen more than once to activate the screen or to select something. The fingerprint reader is an optical one so it's hit or miss sometimes. I have found that  if I pay attention to where I place my finger, it tends to recognize it more easily.  I just never thought I'd miss the one on the S8 considering the poor placement of the thing.  The stereo speakers can get nice and loud and are better than the single firing ones found on my old phone. Reviewers say that the sound is not as rich as the more premium version of this phone bit if you're coming from a phone that is over 2 years old with only a single speaker, you' enjoy them.. Definitely  get a phone cover because the plastic back does scratch and dent easily if you drop it on asphalt as I'm finding out. Haptics are another area where Samsung cut back on this model. The vibration feels close to that of the S7 in a rickety sort of way. To their credit, they have calibrated the vibration motor to react more like when you are moving the cursor around on a text box like that found in a pixel. Just don't expect a solid thump like on the note 10 plus or the S20s. 6 Gb of ram is plenty now but I may wish I had gotten a phone with 8+ GB in a few years after some OS updates. Only time will tell. Its a crazy time and hard to believe that phone prices have inflated the way they have but if you can get the phone on sale, it's a no brainer and very easy to recommend."
86,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Update 7/20/22I am still satisfied with my phone, in fact I have grown fonder of it. After using it for a few months I like its battery life better as it lasts me through the day.The phone is highly customizable thru the ""Good Lock"" app.The volume on the speakerphone has been useful a few times when I have taken while riding my bike with the phone on an armband.I still highly recommend this phone, specially when there's a sale or refurbished one available. More bang for the buck!-------I upgraded from a Galaxy S8. I love the bigger screen size. I miss the physical thumbprint on my old phone, but the on-screen one on the S21FE is very responsive. After reading about all the issues people have had with the Pixel 6, I was wary. This phone exceeded my expectations. It is fast and the screen size is just right. For my older eyes I can read well, and will just fit in my back pocket [inside of a Spigen case].The sound is good as I place calls on speakerphone or listen podcasts while I mull around the kitchen.The battery is average, it is great that it can be charged wirelessly since having it in my jacket pocket while I cycle I get condensation and would not be able to charge it with a cable until it fully dries.I set my refresh screen to 60Mhz to save some battery and the scrolling is still smooth.To nitpick, it would be nice to have a SD card slot when I want to shoot a lot of pics or bring extra lectures (videos) to watch at my leisure.The modem has been great and I have been getting speeds of 300Gbps in Chicago (Metro by T-Mobile)I am very happy with this phone and think the icing on the cake was that it will get 4 android versions. I normally keep my phones until they give the ghost."
87,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"This phone is an upgrade from my $300 Motorola g6 that worked well for 3+ years but lacked the quality camera and some other features and was starting to become noticeably slower.In upgrading my 3 highest priorities were hearing aid support, a better camera and faster processor for a price under $500.I also considered the Pixel phones but chose this one for the cameras and price. All the better phones I looked at could stream directly to my Oticon More I hearing aids.The face ID works as well as I expected as long as there is sufficient light. Why the phone doesn't produce more light when it needs it is a curiosity to me.Like other phones I've had the fingerprint reader seems to require me to change how I apply my finger to the reader as time goes by.The battery life is good and I only need to charge during the day if I am doing g a lot of Bluetooth broadcasting to my hearing aids.Thy biggest annoyance at this point is I usually have to re-pair my hearing aids at least once a day."
88,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Bought the 256GB version when it was on sale for $599 on Amazon which was a very good buy.Overall it's a decent flagship phone, some may say lower tier flagship which I could understand. Performance is alright but it's Android so you will occasionally get app freezing every now and again. Camera is good (not great) but pixel 6 is better. I love the many many features that Samsung that this device comes with such as Bixby routines (game changer), Samsung Dex, secure folder, good lock, RAM Plus, a customizable always on display, edge panels, link to windows for synchronization with a windows computer, smart widgets (stacking multiple interactive widgets together that can rotate) video call effects with apps such as duo as duo, WhatsApp, MS Teams, zoom. The screen recorder actually captures the audio from a zoom or Google meet etc. Battery life is good enough once you don't use 120hz all the time (Bixby routine can help with that).This phone will get 4 years of OS updates and 5 years of security updates so that's really great for longevity.Wouldn't recommend it for $699 but if you see it on sale for much less (you certainly will on Amazon) then go for it"
89,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,This phone is probably my fifth android from Samsung since switching from Blackberry. I formerly traveled a great deal and needed to be in contact. I was an early adapter but not a nerd. I choose Samsung over other manufacturers and have been very satisfied. iphone users always seem ready to put the Android down but I find the Samsung a much better price point. Each one seems to get a little better. Especially the camera optics. No exception with this one. My wife is now using my previous A50 model and is very satisfied. Previously all the Samsungs were the S series. I have never cracked a screen that I recall and that makes me believe they are sturdy.
90,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I've been using this for quite awhile now and have had 0 problems. Everything is as described and working as intended.
91,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Overall I like the phone. It's definitely missing basic features like a headphone jack, that I enjoyed on my Samsung Galaxy A52.That being said, the thing with Samsung phones is that the battery could be twice this size and it'll only last as long as the average time of other brands. Samsung has horrendous battery managent because they force you to always run their bloatware. You can't uninstall them and some you can't remove notifications or stop from running.In general I really like the camera and the screen. You can't get the specs that this phone has for the sale price. It does have smaller cameras but it's about the software and the sensors being used here. I can have a phone with 100+ megapixels and still lack the details that this phone provides. It's why I turned down similar Motorola, Nokia, TCL and other branded phones.I also wanted dust resistance which this phone is good at. Truthfully, LG phones blew these Samsung phones out of the water. But hype and brand popularity kept Samsung chugging along while real competition got removed. So now I'm stuck using this phone until another company comes along. But it is a good phone! So no worries there. You just won't have good battery life. Also Samsung phones are notoriously slow chargers, my 5yr old phone charges faster than this thing. I'm talking about older than 2010 speeds. Definitely buy a fast charger! It's needed just to get average speeds."
92,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Great features in this phone, especially for the price. There's always a catch, though, and in this case it's battery life. I upgraded from an older Samsung Android wanting 5G and better battery life. I got one of those. This one is slightly better than my 3 year phone related to battery life, but it's way more powerful. Can't have your cake and eat it too."
93,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I had an 8s. This phone is about the same size and works basically the same. I have 2 complaints: it keeps showing pop ups, like multi media formating for at least a whole minute which prevents me from reading the text I received; difficult to assign individual notification sounds for each app (ie, I wanted a knocking sound for text messages only, but no matter what I do it knocks for other apps as well)."
94,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I like the battery on this new phone.  10x better than my last.
95,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Phone is wonderful. Battery life is long, screen looks new and everything works as it should. Lots of storage, downloads fast and pictures turn out beautiful. Would buy again"
96,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Used for one week.  Dropped on counter tops and busted screen
97,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Love it's battery life and overall performance.  Easy to use and great pictures!
98,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"The price was good for a damn good phone. I went with the S20 because it is the last to offer the mini SD card slot. Easy transfer of pictures and music. I had a S9 previously. This S20 is crazy fast, and the battery life is better than expected. All day and more.Good price (half of the brand new S22) on the fence? Get off the fence and order it"
99,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"This a good phone with a good camera, battery life isn't the best. Notice it does not have a memory slot. You will only get the cable (C to C) and adapter is not included. Some cables (USB to C) do not work properly so I ended up buying the Samsung adapter C to C. Android Auto DOES NOT WORK on this phone, I had to buy an adapter for the car (usb to C) cables used with other phones didn't work. Adapter didn't recognize the Android Auto app either (I bought Samsung original cables), I have done everything but it just don't work on this phone. I have read that all Samsung S21 have reported the same issue. This is frustrating, Android Auto works fine with Pixel 6 and Xiaomi, so I'm considering changing the phone."
100,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"As others have noted, the fingerprint reader is not great. I upgraded from a 3a, and I really miss having a dedicated spot that I could press while my phone was still in my pocket, so that it was unlocked by the time I was looking at my phone. Now I have to get it out, find where I'm supposed to press, and sometimes try multiple times before it works. At best, it takes ~2 seconds longer to unlock than the 3a. I guess, in some ways, it's good to add a little friction to the process of unlocking my phone so maybe I'm less tempted to check it all the time?One big improvement from the 3a is that my hotspot appears to work much, much better. I spend an hour or so a day on the bus, so I like to get as much work done as I can. My 3a worked fine in this regard from 2019 up through the pandemic, but since I started going back to work in fall 2021, the hotspot no longer worked for about a quarter of my bus ride, and it often dropped unexpectedly, meaning I would sometimes lose work. So far, I haven't had any hotspot issues with the 6a. That alone makes it worth upgrading.As was expected, the performance feels much better. Apps and websites load a lot faster. I also like the wide angle lens."
101,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"Although there are some things that I dislike, this phone is definitely a buy if you are looking to change from old phones. This phone doesn't come with the specs of the high-end phones, but it is good enough for daily uses. Unless you are planning on playing games with heavy graphics or taking long (20+ mins) quality videos, this phone does the job.There are two things I do dislike about this phone.One is that its gyro censor is not very great. I like to watch youtube in bed, so I will flip my phone around to horizontal and vertical views a lot. Pixel 6a seems very slow or insensitive to the shifts and it will take couple times to get it to the right side.Second thing is that its finger print recognition is rather slow compared to other android phones. I did get used to it as I used this phone, but those switching from galaxy might find it annoying."
102,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"If you seek an affordable Android phone with a very good camera, look no farther.  The Google camera software is right up there with cameras costing way more dinero.  The earlier complaint of poor battery life seems to have been fixed with the latest upgrades although I wouldn't call the battery life stellar.  With a 60 hz refresh rate and an ok battery, it's not for heavy gaming use, otherwise its fine for typical activities.  It also fits nicely in smaller hands, my wife loves it.  It's also nice to have Google Assistant field your calls and the language translation software is really nice too.  Because of the quality that you get for the low cost, an easy 5 stars."
103,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"Original review: This phone is not really unlocked. The OEM Unlock option is greyed out in Developer Options!Update!!! The phone I received came with Android 12 Apr2022 version, which will not let you enable the OEM Unlock option in Developer Options. However, once I went to System Updates and let it install Android 12 Jun2022 security update, factory reset the phone, connected to WiFi (all without a SIM inserted), I was able to enable the OEM Unlock option in Developer Options. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars as I am sure many of us are trying to enable the OEM Unlock option and there are no instructions/messages from the supplier about the version issue. At least not one that I could find. I had to Google around to find a solution."
104,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"I replaced a Google Pixel 4a with the 6a when my 4a wouldn't charge. The 6a has many similar features as the 4a, but they slightly changed a few things so that you have to search for the feature. I still tap the back of the phone looking for the fingerprint recognition spot. However, the screen spot does work 95% of the time. The 5G speed is nice and worked well internationally as well. The one complaint I have is that the battery life is well below the level that my 4a had. When my 4a quit charging, the battery life was still over 3 days per charge. The 6a battery life will last a day, but not 2 or 3 days. I liked the Google Pixel enough to buy another one. It works fine and does everything I want it to do."
105,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"I'm not what you'd call a power user, but this phone meets my needs very well. I've had no issues with the speed, display or memory on the phone. I don't believe the battery life is as long as they say. It usually lasts about five to six hours if I use it to stream video. One annoyance I have is the location of the speakers. When I hold my phone, my finger covers one of them, muting the phone and buzzing my finger. When I put a case on the phone, it helped somewhat with that though. Overall very pleased with it."
106,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"Very nice.  Much better than i was expecting.  Smaller than i was expecting too.  For a 2nd tier phone, it stands out.  The camera is great.  As a black person, i was happy to see it capture all the skin tones of me and my daughter.  It was an easy tranfer between it and my Motorola Stylus (which was bigger).  I will be getting the larger pro version for my next purchase.  My wife and kids are Apple fans.  I have always liked Android."
107,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"Not thoroughly impressed with features.  It works, reception is good, volume is good, and camera takes ok pictures.  However, for price, the battery isn't impressive at all."
108,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"This Pixel just works better than the 4a.  Quicker, better battery life, better reception, better fingerprint reader, etc.My 4a would hang when coming out of a sleep mode to the point I had to cycle power.  No such problems with this 6a.  Camera might be a little better, and the upgraded photo processing software is amazing.  Note, the attached picture is a night sight image done on the 4a.Just wish Google would include wireless charging"
109,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,Takes a bit of patience and some googlel searches to figure out the features
110,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,Disappointed no way to charge especially if this is your first Pixel device - good for Amazon had to order plug and/or an adapter.  Adapter that comes with it is the wrong sex to use with USB 3 electrical socket and supplied cable.  You would think Google wouldnâ€™t want you to regret the purchase because you have no way to charge even before setup.  Google claims everyone should have had a plug like this already.  I know many especially Android/iPhone/iPad users that are still on lightning or older android type cables.  Phone seems to be ok havenâ€™t used much.  Much heavier than Pixel 4a.  Think it will take some getting use to.
111,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"I picked up this Pixel 6a to replace my aging Essential Phone (if anyone remembers those)... Needless to say, it's an excellent replacement. The Google Tensor chip is incredibly fast and its AI smarts (especially the Magic Eraser feature) are truly magical. Features like these are really what make Pixel devices stand out from the rest. (The excellent software experience is another pro in this regard.)The new camera bump design is quite attractive and undoubtedly distinctive. Those who have seen a Pixel 6 before will certainly know this is a Pixel 6-series device with just a glance.Although this device misses the glass back from the Pixel 6, I personally find this a worthy tradeoff - despite being a fairly large device (with a 6.1 inch diagonal display), it's actually noticeably lighter than the Essential Phone (which has a 5.7 inch diagonal display).Battery life, particularly while not connected to the cellular network, is also excellent. I can easily get 2 days of full-time, daily driver use - and 4-5 with the Extreme Battery Saver feature enabled. I don't need to worry about charging this phone every night.Overall, the Pixel 6a is absolutely a worthy replacement for my Essential Phone - not to mention, I was able to pick up a practically new one through Amazon Warehouse for around $290, which is less than I originally paid for the Essential Phone several years ago. I hope I'll be able to get another 5-6 years out of this phone, just as I did with the Essential Phone."
112,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"This phone makes me wish I could easily replace the battery in my pixel 3a. I hear they're making easy battery replacement a law in Europe, and I really hope the U.S. follows that lead soon!PROS: Overall, the phone is a decent functioning phone as one would expect, the display is good, the photos are really good and in general it does about as good as most of the pixels I've owned, with a few notable exceptions (see below). I've had a Pixel 1, and a 3a, and now this 6a, so I have a fair amount of experience with these phones, which is probably why this one is so far a disappointment.CONS: I already miss the headphone jack. I used to plug my phone into my (older) computer speakers from time to time, but that's no longer an option. I hope the jack comes back in future devices, but it seems like that's unlikely.BATTERY LIFE is not good. In the past, my new pixels would last for a day and a half, even under heavy use, but this one can't even make it from 7am to dinner time. Maybe the lack of a headphone jack and the extra use of bluetooth is a factor, but I'm not very happy that I have to recharge a brand new phone at 5pm almost daily.FINGERPRINT READER - this is probably the most noticeable step backward from my pixel 3a. The rear print reader on the 3a was lightning fast and conveniently located. The screen fingerprint reader on the 6a is terrible. I'd estimate that the phone only unlocks on the first try around 50% of the time. This is super annoying when you're driving and just trying to change the streaming channel. Also, the ""stay unlocked on home wifi"" feature is either broken on mine or is also terrible, as my phone is constantly locking and requiring me to use the crappy fingerprint reader when I'm at home.SCREEN BRIGHTNESS - On my 3a I could set my adaptive brightness where I wanted it and it would adjust to differing light conditions nearly flawlessly, but the 6a again, is a step down. Sometimes it goes extremely dark, other times it jumps to 100%... it's very unpredictable and almost seems broken. Again, the 3a was a far better device.In closing, I can't recommend this phone. I mean, if you're using a free phone that came with your wireless plan, the 6a might be a step up, but compared to the past pixels I've owned, this one is hands-down the runt of the litter. Maybe I'll get used to it, but I'm already thinking of trading it in for something else."
113,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"I'm a very light user. Primarily it is connected to my hearing aids and is otherwise used for occasional calls, texting and emails. I'm getting 2 to 3 days of battery life from a charge which is more than adequate for me. The USB C charging socket seems to be a little harder to connect to than on my Pixel 3aXL. No problem when using a cord but on my charging stand it takes some jiggling to get it to work."
114,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"I am tired of buying expensive cell phones that need replaced every 3 years.  I felt much more comfortable buying a phone for $299 that should last 4-5 years.  The battery life has been exceptional (I use my phone pretty hard and I have only been charging every other day) and I have no complaints about the functionality.  The in screen fingerprint reader has taken some getting used to, but I went with my thumbprint, somewhat sideways and that has been working great.  No regrets with this purchase."
115,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"I got the charcoal 6a with free $50 Amazon gift card (so the phone was essentially $399), which Amazon shipped with adequate padding.On the first day, the phone got VERY hot and the battery drained pretty fast, but that was likely due to all the updates and setup going on in the background. No heat or battery problems in the following days, with the battery lasting safely through the whole day. I also turned off 5g, which may have helped with battery life/overheating.Misc thoughts:- I mostly use the phone for messaging, photos, and social media, so the 60hz display refresh rate doesn't bother me (you can reduce animation speed in developer options to make it feel faster)- the fingerprint reader has been reasonably responsive and accurate, even with a glass screen protector- the phone feels easier to hold (lighter, narrower) than my previous 6.3""+ phones, which my wrists appreciate- very solid basic Android experience with limited bloatware pre-installed. Lots of cool features, like notification snoozing, now playing, and the Material You theme- the back of the phone does feel kind of slippery, but I got a case so that's a non-issue nowI do miss the headphone jack, but these days I mostly use Bluetooth earbuds with my phone anyway. I also wish Google included a charger brick in the box, and that the phone came with those ""plastic"" screen protector things out-of-box so I didn't have to smudge fingerprints all over it before I got a case."
116,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"There's already been a lot said about this phone so this will cover what I've found to be good and bad after using it since launch.Coming from a 3a, this was a smoother and better looking experience. The size is almost perfect and the feel is better. The 6 pro looks better sure, but the 6a isn't bad. The storage is still bad and of course you can't add a SD card to expand it! This is probably my biggest issue with phones today, they lock you out of expanded storage!!! Also, you can't get aftermarket batteries! Also Google reduced how many versions you're guaranteed and now offer less than other manufacturers on their own OS! So three strikes already!The other issue is the software, android 12. I haven't rooted in a long time and this has made me do it again. I upgraded my 3a to A12 and I still was able to take screenshots by holding the power button that gave me the option to take one. It was extremely nice and better than the ""hold power and volume down"". What did A12 do.... Go back to the two-button screenshot! What a dumb thing to do.The next problem is the swipe back feature, you can't disable the right side. Seriously, what is wrong with the devs? It's like they keep giving people less and less options. It's so screwed up and the bad thing is you don't find out until you buy it because reviewers can't or often don't mention these things because sometimes what bothers ""you"" won't bother themOne last issue is Google seems to be moving some photos editing tools away from the free app that's installed on the phone and onto their paid service. This is once again why I hate so many companies today, they nickel and dime you while taking away what was once part of something offered at no additional cost.One more thing, sometimes the phone hangs when switching between apps or your stuck with an empty screen with only your background. This never happened on my 3a.Overall, it's an okay upgrade over the 3a but if it wasn't for the slightly better storage (cough), and getting a good deal on it, this is not a great upgrade. Too many issues with the software (back steps and the like), and lack of battery/storage upgrades. Google isn't alone in the latter, it's a trend by almost all the phone makers today which is wrong."
117,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"My Pixel 5a 5G battery routinely lasted three days before requiring a charge. This Pixel 6a requires a charge on the second day.  Also, the 6a is rather ""quirky"" when compared to the 5a."
118,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,The phone works for what it is worth. Most of bad reviews come from people who expect flagship level of performance when you only spend half the price of flagship phones.Fingerprint and battery is ok.Call quality is great. Lightweight and easy to hold. It does the job with smooth interface.
119,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"As the picture shows, it came with a warning that it didn't work with CDMA networks like Verizon. THIS IS NOT TRUE. It works with Verizon fine. I don't know why they put this on there. It just led to unnecessary confusion."
120,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"I was an avid Samsung owner. Their prices have gotten down right ridiculous for a phone that only lasts a few years. My daughter recommended a Pixel, so I bought it. Best advice ever! It's simple, intuitive & can handle a plethora of apps. Battery life is phenomenal! Don't even get me started on the camera. The best photos I've ever taken. All this for a fraction of an older Samsung. I'm a Pixel peep now!"
121,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"I have never been someone who spends more than $100 on a phone and I tend to keep them long after most people have upgraded. So when I decided to get this phone (at $449 with a $50 gift card, nice deal) I was taking a big step. When it stopped having service within 12 hours I wasn't happy. I was able to contact Amazon for an exchange in the hopes I just got a lemon and so far, a week later, the replacement is working awesome. I haven't updated Adaptive Connectivity Service because with the first phone that's when things went wonky, and while it could be a coincidence (and likely is since even a factory reset didn't fix the connectivity problem) I don't want to chance it (and from reviews it looks like that app is less than useful anyway). I take a lot of photos and I love the software features for that (magic eraser is pretty magical).It's not top-of-the-line but for $399 I wasn't expecting a Samsung Galaxy 22, so I happy - or at least I'm happy with the second phone!"
122,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"Replaced my Pixel 3a.  Why?  No 5g and no more software upgrades.  This Pixel 6a has 5g, prompt upgrades till 2027, better photo hardware and software, and all at a tremendous price.  Plus, Amazon is giving me trade-in credit for my Pixel 3a!  I took both phones to my T-Mobile store, and the transfer went swiftly and pretty easily."
123,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,The AI and app responsiveness is the best I've had. I used to own a Motorola G play which had a Snapdragon processor/SOC and this is much faster. I love the Google suite and coming from Microsoft Office I might be using Google now for everything except for OneDrive from Microsoft. This is the best phone I've owned and I've always gone with the mid-range.I'm also a programmer and had difficulty integrating with the Windows APIs but at a glance Google seems very easy. I plan to write my first app with this phone.
124,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"Light, great performing phone for the price.  I like the smaller size.  The camera has lots of options.  Battery life could be better.  Software is occasionally a bit flaky."
125,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"Photos are great, and all I could ask for on a smartphone. Great $300 phone."
126,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"I'm not interested in having the best camera feature or the fastest video rating, just want to talk and text on the phone.  This phone is satisfying all my basic phone needs.  Great value for the money.  Operating system updates and security features are a great benefit.  Very satisfied with the Google Pixel 6A. Gave 4 stars because of minor deficiencies with fingerprint reader, battery life and cost. All could be better but much better than most other phones in this category."
127,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"I got this Google phone to set up as a De-Googled phone. Immediately installed Graphene OS and will never ever use it to go to Google, or anything owned by Google. Phone works great using Graphene OS."
128,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"I am happy with this pixel, very good camera, fluid system and comfortable to use with one hand. the only gripe is with the in-display fingerprint reader, it's not as accurate as the physical reader on my previous pixel 3a XL.but overall, it's the best type ""a"" pixel to date for price, it's good, nice and cheap."
129,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,Does not disappoint for the most part.
130,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"The finger recognition makes a really flashy light and it's kind of annoying, other than that it's really lightweight, friendly interface, the battery lasted for days (tho i don't watch much videos)"
131,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,Using this on T-moble.  Very fast screen response and good image quality.  Camera seems to work well even though it has lower pixel specs than others.  5G works well when it's really available.  Good battery life.
132,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"This was un upgrade from my Pixel 3a.  So far - so good, and there is more of a learning curve than I expected, but I'm happy.  I wish it was capable of being charged wirelessly, but otherwise I'm happy with the purchase."
133,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"This is an upgrade of my Pixel 4A 5G. It came charged. Hooked up the supplied cable from my old phone to the 6A. The transfer was super easy and didn't take all that long. I was worried about some of the reviews I had read but decided to give it a shot any way. I love the new phone. The in screen fingerprint reader WORKS GREAT!!! I used it all day long and put it on the charger when I went to bed. No problems. Overall, this is the perfect upgrade. It looks and works like my 4A but I like the idea of the new Tensor chip with upgraded security. Best part, I got it with my Capital One rewards. It didn't come with a charger but charged fine on my quick charger for my ThinkPad and then the next day overnight with USB charging. I highly recommend this phone. Pictures and videos are very good. I like the upgraded software for photo editing. Got the Nineasy [3 in 1] case with kickstand. The buttons are a little stiff but hopefully will ease up some with use. Also came with a screen protector but I'm not using it. My phone was unlocked. Using it on Consumer Cellular. I'm an old fart and am home most of the time so I use my wifi for data most of the time. This isn't a ""flagship"" phone but it works great for me. $400 versus $1200...I can live without all the ""bells and whistles""."
134,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,The only thing I don't really like is it heats up a little fast when using it to play a game or are searching for something for a bit. It's not bad enough for me to not like the phone though. Still think my 3a XL is a tad better in terms of battery.
135,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"Pros - Fair price, Smooth operation and perfect size for pockets. The camera is excellent for the price point.Cons - some issues with fingerprint reader.  while others have complained about non registered fingers opening phone, my issues have been with my registered finger failing.  Usually works eventually though.Overall a good phone for the price!"
136,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"the phone is great.I am upgrading from a 3 year old LG G8 thinq to this Pixel 6a.Screen on the LG is better; however, the processor on 6a  is awesomewithout wireless charging is a bit inconvenient though.and no face recognition is another minusthe finger scanner is very bright flash.  usually takes 2 ~ 3 scans  .the LG does a better job here.another setback is the screen is not as sensitive.  sometimes , it takes 2 - 3 taps to wake it up from sleep modeof course, the infamous black screen is also another flaw that has been plaguing all the pixel phonesfor me, I would push the power button to get out of the black screen"
137,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"The phone does great.  The only disappointment I have is crappy battery life.  I can barely get 2 days out of a charge.  Lots of storage, and very good camera."
138,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"If you want a small, powerful phone for not a high price, then this is the phone for you. Yes, the fingerprint scanner. It's a bit slow but I get past that."
139,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"not bad phone, size is better than pixel 6, but for these money could be better. screen frame could be thinner, and screen refresh rate could be at least 90Hz.during a play phone gets hotter than pixel 4a for instance, if you play and at the same time charging, battery percentage not going up, fingerprint works with delay and ......"
140,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"This is half the price of a Iphone and its better! The audio feels more natural then the iphone 12, and the overall feel is just satasfying on the hand."
141,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,Good and real item
142,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"I have enjoyed the Pixel 6a phone. For the features it has, I think the prices is good. It is great that it recharges fast. It has good battery life. It would have been good if Google would have included a charger but they don't. Despite this, to me it has been a good phone."
143,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,I bought this new phone (a Pixel 6a) because of the great reviews and because my previous Android phone (a Moto G7) had received no updates after Android 10 and seemed to be slowing down. The new 6a has a slightly smaller screen (6.1 in vs 6.3) that is often difficult to use accurately. I generally am not a fan of typing on phones and the error rate on this phone is far higher than on any other phone I've owned. When texting I often get errors that produce actions that don't even show on the screen (hitting the post button often calls up the delayed send screen and hitting the comma button often pulls up the emoticon screen). The battery has been fine and my reception (especially for streaming music while driving) has been better than my previous phone. But this problem with screen accuracy is frustrating!
144,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,Had a Google Pixel 3 for yearsGOOGLE PIXEL 6AIS REMARKABLE..
145,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"This phone is great. I was actually between this phone and the IPhone SE 2022 and choosed this one because of the preoder deal where it came the pixel buds A-series for free. Before this phone I was daily driving an IPhone XS and this phone has similar to a  bit better daily performance which is not bad, much better battery life, faster charging, better photos and smarter better virtual assistance with much better features.I'm not what you can call a power user, I use my phone to take and make call, cheking email, social media, and for music/media streaming which this phone has excelled at. Dont get me wrong, this phone isn't for everyone. If you want top notch features dont expect to find them here but if all you need is a modern looking device with nice to have features, solid essentials and at least 3 years of softwre updates, this is it.One quick pro that I see no one talking about is the fact that google sells original replacement parts throught IFixIt.com."
146,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"Haven't had this long, but so far so good.  It did not come with any instructions at all.  So I have had to get them online.  Otherwise, its a good phone.  I  had the 2XL pixel before this one."
147,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,"The phone is very responsive and display is great especially for the price range. The battery life is pathetic however. My phone is about dead in the early evening with medium to low usage AND with battery saver on. Not a big deal if you have access to charging mid day but I work outside so this is not always an option.Also, Google phones aren't compatible with Firstnet which I learned when trying to setup my Firstnet account. It was super easy to port my Verizon line over though.Overall it's a pretty decent phone for the money and my 3 star review really just reflects my specific issues"
148,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,Nothing negative except it's now $50 cheaper then when I bought mine :(
149,Google,Pixel 6a,128 GB,Android,6.13 Inches,Upgraded from Galaxy A50.  This Pixel is amazing.  Price is also amazing.  High end phone for budget phone price.  Also 5 years of security updates so it will last longer.  Very happy.
150,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"First impressions: Was looking for a decent and affordable entry level android phone with at least 6GB and this appears to fit the bill.  Cannot comment on reliability as its a new purchase.Android 12 requires at least 4GB of memory to run (phone with no active applications that I've launched appears to use  3.8GB of memory). Hence my 6GB minimum requirement.Not much bloatware apps (FB, Microsoft Outlook). I was able to uninstall the bloatware I didn't need.Volume and power buttons are on the right side, not sure I quite like that yet.Was able to be recognized on Verizon and nearly completed the activation step, though I didn't go through with VZ activation as VZ required me to switch up to a higher priced 5G plan (would lose my grandfathered cheaper 4G plan).  Decided to activate on Visible (VZ MVNO) instead.Would not buy the phone at its regular price."
151,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I have owned this phone for 3+ months. I usually don't do reviews for anything, but I am particularly satisfied with this product.For the average smartphone user, this is all you need. For all tasks / apps besides high-demanding games this phone is absolutely as peppy as anyone would need even with quick motion enabled (120 hz refresh rate). The phone camera is also quite good (slightly better than the Pixel 6's camera).My only complaint is Samsung's bloatware applications that are pre-installed with the phone. Would not be a big deal if you could simply uninstall all of them, but you can't without some software level tinkering that would likely void the phone's warranty.5 star product quality and experience, minus 1 star for Samsung's pre-installed bloatware applications."
152,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Extremely short time to create and type password, being handicapped it took me about 15 attempts. Thought I finally got it since it asked me to type it again but then said it was wrong. So I advice you to make password short (it says  you must have at least 4 characters and at least one letter.) Once you get into phone you can go to settings and make time much longer for putting in your password. You can also change your password but do this after making time longer. I can't get into phone to do this because it never said to verify password. Important...make sure you received a travel adapter that come with order...mine was missing. Because of that I can't do a 'hard factory reset' and start over. I don't want to send phone back I just need help to get into the phone, meanwhile battery life is great."
153,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"* Special Edit * Many if not all recent Samsung phones no longer come with the usb wall  charger. You will not get it in the box.Coming from an A7 2017 model, this phone is incrementally great. Its not a huge difference but the main issue today is really OS and security updates end thus forcing a new phone. Because of using Samsung SmartTags, I likely cannot use a custom rom. If it wasn't for that, the A7 2017 really isn't that far from this. That's something I can now test.The A53 has a surprisingly better speaker. Really loud and sounds like it's coming from the front instead of the bottom where it is. Actually, seems they also use the call speaker as well to output sound which is on the top.The camera is a bit better of course. It's good enough. I'm no camera snob or you better be buying the most expensive phones if you ask me. Has macro function. Also does a good job focusing.The fingerprint reader is about the same once enabling it to always show on the always on display (AOD) and I set AOD to always show as well.The screen is good. There's no wild difference other than marketing.Battery seems about the same in limited testing (my A7 still gets about 48 hours with AOD enabled and some use). The battery saving special modes can add up to days of battery life mostly on standby. So in theory up to 7 days. The A7 has this feature and its great for no power emergencies. Looks like a bit differently implemented on the A53 but still have to properly test it. I know for a fact that Android devices can last up to 12 days on standard batteries as I have one that does. A much bigger screen, etc at 7 days standby is wonderful. My numbers for sleep drainage show it might even make it without the battery saver.But, the A53 battery will take some weeks or months to properly see how the battery does. Interesting, point AOD here has no auto off (and on) while down or in a pocket which is crazy. That instantly saves battery and is crazy they no longer have it. Instead they have schedule so you can at least get a partial worse effect of it at night when sleeping or tap to show, etc. The A7 thus gets me only total 3-4% drain at night even with AOD enabled. So far, the A53 with AOD always enabled sees 3% for 7 hours overnight. Looks like 4% per 8 hours. This is for my setup. Your's may differ.Actually,  one of the best improvements appears to be the cellular connection. It appears to be 2-3 bars stronger than the A7. Since the A7 was typically at 1 bar for me, it would often not receive calls, delayed messages, etc. So far,  I'm receiving everything. This was a main issue I always had with the A7. Easily exceeding everything else the phone offers.By the way, I'm using the A7 wall charger here.  It's 15 watts. That's fine. The A53 just charges 10 watts slower than the maximum. I see no need for now to spend more for that. It just charges a bit slower. As I edited in earlier, don't expect Samsung include them now with their phones. The A53 does not come with one for anyone who thinks it does. Neither does their more expensive models this year.So far not seeing any issues. I'm happy with it.  But, there's far too many features anymore. Takes a lot of time. I'd still be almost as happy though with the A7 if it wasn't trashed by the phone manufacturers like they are. But, if you need a phone, this one is a great choice. I highly doubt that will change here. You also get up to 4 years OS upgrades and 5 years security which increases the value of this phone over many manufacturers.Bug: AOD stuck at full brightness in the dark thus consuming more battery. SOLVED: The eye comfort shield (what they call the software blue screen filter for night time that makes the screen yellowish) causes AOD to have problems dimming when both are running."
154,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I had my LG G8 for three years. Wish I could've kept it for another three but...meh, that's the shelflife of phones for ya. My daughter has an A52 and loves it. I wonder if her phone is faster than my A53? This phone seems to take 1-3 seconds to execute a task. It's a budget phone, yes, so I expect some drawbacks. The slowness isn't a deal breaker. But it is worth pointing out. Call quality is excellent, speakers are excellent, usual Samsung phone features are excellent. Save for the lag, it's all good."
155,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Overall, this is a great Samsung phone that offers a smooth user experience.Pros:- It's fast.- The screen resolution and refresh rate are excellent.- Smooth experience streaming videos. Great sound quality.- Fingerprint sensor works very well.- Battery life is great - easily lasts more than a day (I usually charge it every 2-3 days).- Excellent storage capacity.- Takes clear and sharp photos and videos.- Great phone call quality.- Love the fact that it will receive 5 years of security updates, which is very important these days.Cons:- As with ALL Samsung smartphones, there is A LOT of proprietary bloatware (I previously owned a Pixel and iPhone, both of which contained very little bloatware). I was able to uninstall a few bloatware apps and disable others. For the apps I couldn't disable, I denied them the ability to run in the background and restricted battery access, which helps to extend the daily battery life for up to 2-3 days. They can also be hidden from sight.- I found it annoying that Samsung has its own redundant app store to Google Play and has proprietary apps that ask the user to create a Samsung account. Seems unnecessary when the phone runs on Google's Android system.- No travel adapter included. Seller got the description wrong about what's included in the box. - No wireless charging, but not a big deal for me.Overall, this is a great phone for the value despite the bloatware. For users unaccustomed to Samsung, if you spend some time customizing the permissions and notifications for the bloatware apps, you'll likely enjoy using the phone, too.10/11/2022 Update:- Phone continues to work well for my average user needs, e.g, talk, text, web surfing, streaming, reading ebooks/newspapers/magazines, using Google Pay/Maps/Drive/Docs/Sheets/Notes and other productivity apps, taking pictures, etc.- Battery life continues to be excellent, as I've ensured that most apps (other than the communication apps) do not use background data and have restricted battery access. If you don't make those adjustments, they would drain any big battery quickly.- I like the default Device Care app that helps to further optimize the battery life and puts to sleep apps that haven't been used in a while.- Taking screen-prints is not straightforward, as I had to research online on how to do so. There's no app/icon for it. I have to push the Down button and Power button (located on the same side) simultaneously to print the screen. Not the most convenient.- I can't opine on the dual sim or SD memory card features, as I don't use them."
156,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Expandable memory should be standard on all phones...talking to you apple. Having shopped around for a phone that checks every box, I came across this gem of a phone. Camera isn't super good (no 3x mechanical zoom), but neither are my skills with one...I won't know the difference. Sound is loud enough, I can hear it while operating a crane...probably shouldn't, but I digress. Screen refresh rate is smoooth. Doesn't have the fastest processor, but honestly, who needs a top end phone processor. People that do won't be looking at this phone's review...if you think you do, more power to you. Speaking of power, the battery on this is huge. Plenty of bat time to veg out on streaming services or social media all day long...not while operating the crane of course. If you use a corded ear phones, you'll need to get a usb-c one...they are just as cheap as the old fashion ones so don't let that be a deal breaker. Won't go back to top tier phones. Especially one that doesn't have expandable memory...I'm not using your cloud service so you can sell my data that much easier. Get this phone.Verizon users note: Certain Verizon services won't be supported on this unlocked phone. The Verizon call filter, Verizon HD calling, and Verizon video calling - you'll have to use Google services for those options."
157,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"The phone just seems to work well all around. I haven't had any significant issues with this phone to date and those things that I can point to as a negative are not enough to take off more than one star. It just works. Battery overall has good performance, but it does depend on which apps you use and if you have consistent cell signal. There can be a bit of a lag in the screen when scrolling and tapping quickly on things, but it's not something I haven't been able to get used to. Glass has proven to be rather strong as I completely shattered a glass screen protector, but the phone glass had no sign of wear."
158,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Only Con I can think of compared to the phone It replaced is the lack of physical fingerprint sensor. The screen sensor feels kind of slow and not 100% there in comparison. Lack of headphone jack? buy a USB-C to 3.5"" adapter and be done with it. Great screen refresh rate and pretty colors. 4 years of updates and expanded storage capacity to 1TB were the main selling points for me."
159,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"This phone truly is a budget friendly version of a flagship phone! However the amount of bloatware that comes with it is rediculous! Hence the reason for taking off a full point! The way the settings are set up also very quickly drain your battery. If you take the time to set your settings right this phone will boast a 2-day battery life!!! The screen sensitivity is incredible and the fingerprint detection is wonderful!!! The sound is great and clear, it has expandable storage, the cameras take very nice videos and photos. There is no headphone jack though and no wireless charging. But if you're like me and don't use wireless charging and use Bluetooth headphones/earbuds anyway... Then it's not really a issue. Gaming is average. But not bad. Need to compromise somewhere. Yeah know? Call quality is SUPERB!!! I love the screen sensitivity it's really a wonderful midrange phone must have!!! Samsung A53 5g for mid range phones did as good if not better in pretty much everything else including a easy to use interface. Samsung also has a clean and user friendly menu panel and display that that knocks competitors out of the park! I truly love this phone!"
160,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I've had this phone now for 18 months and still happy with it. Absolutely no issues. Fast phone. Good storage. Bright display. Can't comment on camera since I don't use it that much.I do use the phone probably 16 hours a day, so if you're a heavy user, you won't have any problems.Very satisfied with purchase decision."
161,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I bought this phone to replace a lost Samsung 10+. I just could not make myself spend $1000 on a phone but I did want a Samsung. I read the reviews on this phone and watched a few YouTube videos. I figured at the price point of $350 I couldn't go wrong. I have been pleasantly surprised at how good this phone is. Great battery life, expandable storage, and a really good display. The Bluetooth works great with my watch and a few other things. I am not a ""gamer"" but I do know that this might not be the best choice for heavy gaming--it seems to need a more powerful chipset for that. Camera is more than adequate. Samsung will provide 4 generations of Android updates and 5 years of security updates.All in all I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it."
162,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"This is a very good phone. Replaced a s21 that was damaged and for all the things that are important to me, I can't tell the difference. It doesn't have the induction charging but because it charged so slow when using it,  I never used it anyway. The camera may not have as good of specs, but I'm betting most people would not be able to tell the difference. The battery last way longer than the one on my s21. Most importantly, at about a third of the price of a new s22, you can't go wrong with this."
163,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,I never am able to get a real cell phone plan because my credit sucks so I always have to buy unlocked phones at full price and don't have a grand to pay for a top of the line phone.  This is the best mid range phone I've ever used.  The camera isn't perfect but it's really good for a mid range phone.  Zoom isn't great but regular view is nice.  The wide angle is really good though.  Custom features for display are nice.  Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a phone with a lot of memory and good battery life who enjoys taking photos
164,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Because of the A53 5G I'm not going back to an S series.  For the price of this is dang good phone.  I'm running on the T-Mobile network and it picks up every single  frequency that T-Mobile has.
165,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Thought I would try a cheaper Samsung phone instead of paying $1000. For the money I paid, I do like this phone but dang it is heavy. Half the time I pick it up I end up dropping it as I'm used to a lightweight phone. Screen is beautiful. Miss some of the photo editing features and speed of moving through different apps and open pages. But honestly, the money saved is worth it."
166,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,I'm an android user love me from Samsung. This phone has so many features. I love it.  So much to learn on this phone. Reports on my use and my whereabouts. I charge it every 4 or 5 days. But when I watch movies or play games it every 2 or three days. Love this phone camera and the speaker is loud. Signal is great.it shows me things I didn't know was on this phone. Large screen. More so long screen then wide. So it fit in your hands well. Not to thin or thick. With my case it a little heavy not much. Thank you seller and Amazon...
167,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Always a hassle to change phones. Even one Android to another is a learning curve. At first I didn't like the fingerprint in the front, but it sure is handy in the car when sitting in its holder. I am a bit disappointed in the camera so far, but I will have to fiddle with it more. Otherwise I find it to be a good basic camera. I have had a slew of issues, actually weeks of issues getting it to work with Verizon. They finally got it working on 4g. I was to switch to a plan with 5g, but they tell me it is missing some kind of 'code' and they are having to manually do it which will take an additional 1-2 weeks. Even they say it is no fault of the phone, but something to do with their software. I've had other issues with Verizon in the last 18 months, like they couldn't figure out how to discontinue Disney from my account. Took almost 6 months and I had to call every month for a credit, so I am strongly considering T-Mobile, BUT I will certainly make sure they can actually hook up to this phone BEFORE switching."
168,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I was able to transfer everything from my old Android to the Samsung Galaxy A53 without too much trouble.  I used Smart Switch to move contacts, photos and text messages.  It was slow going but finally put all my APPs and games, etc. onto the new phone.  I put photo IDs with my contacts, added Speed Dial, etc. and wanted to see how that went before I put my SIM card and SD card in the next day. . . . and, about that, this was a new one for me . . . there is only one SIM card slot.  When you take it out, you see a silver metal piece that says SIM and I thought that had to be removed.  Looked up the phone on the computer.  You put the SIM card on one side of that metal piece and the SD card on the other side. . . a little tricky to keep them both in place as you replace it into the slot.  So far, the cellphone is working well except that I have to pound on it to answer a call or turn off an alarm, at times.  The battery seems to go down quickly, but I have many things on the phone.  I charge it every night and have a car charger as well.  It is the first time I ever received a phone without a way to charge it . . it comes with a cable but both ends are small and I thought I would use one of my many plug/chargers.  Wrong, because they have a bigger end - like a USB - that goes into the plug.  Luckily, my Motorola Moto G Power charger worked with this Samsung A53  [my old Samsung Galaxy S7 did not.]  My Motorola car charger also works so I lucked out.  Shame on Samsung selling a phone without a way to charge it."
169,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"First the size of this phone is significantly larger than my Google Pixel 2 or 4a, but it's far from being the largest phone on the market today.  For use by an elderly parent with diminished eyesight the large screen size is a benefit.  Attached a PopSocket to make it easier to hold and carry.Setup was quite simple, transferring files from a Moto x4 was a bit more difficult and took several attempts, including (not mentioned in instructions) specifically downloading Samsung's data migration app to the Moto, but once that was done everything transferred nicely.Have only had it for about two months and got the first monthly security update for it which is great (when I personally owned a Galaxy S3 circa 2013, updates were very few and very far between).Device is quick and generally works well.  Installed Google's own Phone app instead of Samsung's due to familiarity and known spam call blocking features in Google's Phone app.  The in-screen fingerprint reader is good but in my opinion not great.  My Pixel phones have the rear dedicated fingerprint sensor which works first time every time, while this Samsung Galaxy A53 takes a second or so to recognize and confirm fingerprint, and lets me in about two out of every three tries.  Have it setup with a PIN as well, as a backup just in case.Overall it was a good buy and is a great phone for the price I paid (under $400 US at the time)."
170,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I upgraded from a Moto X4. Would've went Motorola again, but the build quality on their phones is kinda bad now. It was a big adjustment as I've never used a phone with this large of a screen. I really like almost everything about this phone. Nice bright screen, long battery life, great cameras, good performance, waterproof. Only dislikes are the bloatware, missing headphone jack and spotty fingerprint reader. Bloatware doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would, but I wish I could disable more of it. Headphone jack is remedied by a USB C adapter, which works well most of the time. And fingerprint reader issues could most likely be if my fingers are dirty or wet or something. Overall this feels like a flagship phone with it's quality and performance. I'm happy with it."
171,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"A much better cellular radio than the Moto G7s it replaced. Calls can go thru in parts of Maine that showed no signal on the G7. In addition, WiFi calling works on AT&T, unlike the G7.Main camera is not really better than the G7. The 64 Mpx quad Bayer sensor only works in very bright conditions. Otherwise it's a 16 Mpx camera.Unlike the G7, you can't save raw or .dng files. The wide & macro cameras do work, but they're kind of niche.Don't buy it for the camera."
172,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Bought this after wife dropped her previous one and display died.  Could not upgrade phone yet, so we purchased this unlocked version for her.  It has worked just fine with Cricket just by swapping the SIM card."
173,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,This phone didn't come with a charger or travel adapter as advertised.
174,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"This is my second A-series after being a flagship phone person since the release of the OG Moto Droid.  At first I was attracted by the price but then when they got rid of removable storage in the flagships I was never going back. Great phone, great cameras , great battery life and inside the case who knows it is a $350 phone and not a $1250 one?Only thing I miss is the convenience of wireless charging, but it is a small loss for the savings."
175,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"This is actually a great phone.  It's rather large and without a cover, good size and not that heavy.  Most of the functions work well however I can't get messenger to work (for some reason). The big gripe I have is the ""power button"" will NOT shut off the phone.  You have to hold the Power button and press the volume down at the same time and sometimes that doesn't shut off the phone but brings up the stupid Bisby or whatever their helper is so that is very frustrating.  The fingerprint reader works well and you can put more than one finger to use. It did take a bit of time for the reader to ""learn"" your fingers.  The camera is ok but not spectacular IMO.  I am a photographer and would have liked a better zoom feature and adjustable light feature like on my LG phone.  The digital zoom is as usual - crappy.  For the price it is a decent 5G phone and works fairly well with the T-Mobile company.  I have much better coverage than 4G which I was getting ready to leave T-Bag because of such poor coverage.  Enjoy!"
176,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Not what I thought it would be
177,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,This phone performs all the functions one expects in a smart phone and does them really well for a reasonable price.  Only thing this phone doesn't have is wireless charging and that is a small problem indeed.  And for about 1/4 the price of the flagship devices the A53 is the right choice for many.
178,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"The phone has some pluses and minuses.The volume is not really loud on this phone coming  out of the single speaker,  or the ear piece.  The fingerprint reader is not good at all. My previous phone (google pixel 3a) had the reader on the back...and very fast to read your fingerprint.  This reader is on the front and rarely reads the first time.The camera is ok, but not as good as my old pixel. I have shot the same subjects with both, and you can see a difference.The battery should get the average person through a full day, but it is a really slow charging phone, even with a quick charger.I returned a blue phone because there's no security updates, and this phone will be covered for a while. Oh, and the Bluetooth is not awful, but not great either.  If you are looking for a phone that has good storage, security updates, and 5G (my 3a didn't have 3g), then this might be a phone worth looking at."
179,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Update- I have now had this phone for over a month.  A little distressed to see it has already dropped $100, but that is my fault for jumping the gun.My previous phones were a Nord 10 and a Moto G 5G phone (which I still have).  Also a Samsung A52s, which I had for just a few days before sending it back to Amazon.Here's the deal.  The Samsung A52s 5g had a Geekbench 5 score of 721, vs. this new Samsung A53.  The qualcomm processor on the A52s 5g is noticeably faster than this Exynos chip and I can tell that as well in operation.  There's always a little pause, before something happens after touch the screen with this A53.Compared to the Nord 10 and Moto G 5g, though, this phone this phone has faster test numbers.Screen Brightness and battery life is what I wanted in my newest phone!  Didn't get it!  The 5000ma battery does not last any longer than that of the Nord 10, the Moto G 5g or the A52s that I had.Size in this case, does not make a difference.  By the end of the day, I'm still down to 20% or less.  My previous Moto G Power 4g phones would run easily three days, with their 5000ma batteries.  What gives?  Screen brightness is still a problem.  In bright outside light, I still can't see the screen on this phone either, without shading it with my hand.Lastly, the lack of a headphone jack, although I knew it upfront, did turn out to be a problem.  I usually carry around some Panasonic earbuds.  When at an airshow recently, I popped them into my ears, to reduce the noise.  Then remembered, that I couldn't connect them to the phone.Now the good things- 1) I did speed test, near a collection of 5g towers.  My previous Moto G 5g and my Nord 10, while running on T-mobiles network, never achieved more than 58 megabits of download speed.  Which means their tuners could only handle the lower and possible the middle 5g spectrum.  fyi-there are basically 3 group of frequencies (think-low, middle, high).This Samsung A53 achieved more than 300 megabits of speed next to the same set of towers.  That's almost 6 times the download speed of my other 5g phones.  Which means it can tune into the higher spectrum frequencies.2) The microSD expansion slot is a little weird.  The sim goes on one side, then you flip it over to insert the microSD card.  But it handles my 400 mb microSD card and transfer rate s to it are quick.3) It seems sturdy, I've dropped it a time on two within the house.  However, I had it encased in a Spigen, my favorite brand, of cellphone case.My basic opinion, is to give it 4 out of 5.  Mainly because of the lukewarm battery life, sluggish initial touch screen response, underperforming exynos processor and screen not being bright enough against the sun.But the speed of the cellular download, the expansion slot, the screen clarity, the toughness of the phone, make me give it 4 out of 5.  It's dropped $100 in less than 45 days.  That's a bummer."
180,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Like the phone but the problem I have is people have a hard time hearing me & I have to say hello like 3 times before they hear me.  Works the best if I just use the speaker not sure why.  I have never had that problem before.
181,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Been using for about 2 months now. Coming from a note 9 only because the note dosent have 5G, but the A53 worked great. Nice lite little phone with a great Camera and a very bright screen. On screen fingerprint scanner is not the best but definitely works after keeping the screen of fingerprints. Also phone is slight laggy going in and out of certain applications or jumping from apps otherwise phone works great!!! Definitely not flagship but can't complain when you only spend $300."
182,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,This is a good phone if you do the minimum like text or call or video call and do the occasional watch video. Otherwise this phone is kind of slow in my opinion. It is an excellent purchase for the price and doing the minimum. Otherwise this phone isn't for me unfortunately.
183,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"This is my first Samsung phone since the S4, my last phone being a Pixel 4a.  The reason for moving from the 4a was lack of 5G, which for T-Mobile customers who camp or live in remote locations is very important due to the incredible range of T-Mobile 5G.  Both this phone and the Pixel 4a are running Android 12, but this phone has Samsung's version.  Surprisingly I don't find that as annoying as their S4 version back in the day, and it does have some nice features such as being able to lock the home screen layout to prevent items moving, and the ability to preserve battery life both by turning off fast charging and limit charging to 85%.  The main downside is there are apps I would rather not have, mainly Samsung apps, but that's a minor point given the storage available.  The size of the A53 is larger than the Pixel 4a, which is not something I was looking for or wanted, and what results in my ""almost perfect"" title above.This is a dual sim model or single sim, single memory card model.  That corrects one of the deficiencies that kept me from buying Samsung again years ago--the lack of expanded memory.The fingerprint scanner is under the front glass.  It seems to work well, but I'm still getting the hang of learning where to press--that isn't obvious until you try to press in the wrong location, at which time the display will show you.  Being under glass has the advantage of the FP scanner not getting dirty--a problem I had with the Pixel 4a.  I'm not finding being on the front rather than rear to be a big deal.This is may be my first ever non-Snapdragon Android phone, or at least the first in a long time.  I find it very responsive, but the efficiency is yet to be determined due to a lot of daily use just setting up the phone and signing into apps, etc.  But three days in it appears I'll only need to be charging the phone every 2 or 3 days, depending on whether I have the phone limit charging to 85%.There are a few things missing.  No headphone jack, something I never used once on the Pixel 4a and something missing from a lot of phones.  Also it ships with a USB-C cable but no charging brick--not a big deal, and also something becoming more common.Finally, like the 4a, this A53 is made in Vietnam.  I consider that an advantage over made in China for [pick one of many reasons].  Also, Samsung's security update policy is very good, reportedly going 5 years from the March release, which was the reason I didn't look for other 5G midrange phones more the size of the Pixel 4a."
184,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"If your going to put in print what your agreeing to send in the purchase of this product then Amazon should hold up it's end of the agreement. It clearly states:What's in the box1. Data Cable 2. Travel Adapter 3. Ejection PinProblem is that is not true. Yes you get a data cable. end of story. I have a suspicion that that if Amazon barked loud enough that Samsung would send them the Travel Adapters and the Ejection Pins considering how many Samsung products move through the Amazon sales. OR, Amazon could just change the advertisement and tell the truth in the first place. Sure you can return the phone and they will send you a new one; but it won't have the travel adapter or the ejection pin in the new box so what's the point. Time you clean up your act Amazon."
185,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I have not been able to use this phone yet because despite what the item description says about what's in the box, it comes without a charging adapter.  So you have to have something that accepts a usb c connection or else get an adapter.  And I'm waiting on an adapter.Also,  you might want to have it shipped to a pick up location or else stay home near the door on delivery day.  Maybe all the phone deliveries are like this or it could have been this person, but the delivery person didn't even knock on the door and left the package right at the top of the porch steps.  But their record shows they handed it to me personally.  I live in a fairly pirate safe area but if you don't be aware that this may happen."
186,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I ordered this phone because I needed one with more memory.  The description leads you to believe that this isa BRAND NEW phone but alas, I received a REFURBISHED model.  When I opened the amazon box, I got a beat up box with the Amazon Renew label.  I quickly called customer service, and informed that that nowhere in the description did you list this item as refurbished.  I requested an additional discount for this error and it seems to work perfectly so far so be aware!!!"
187,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Great phone Samsung A53, love it.Best phone I owned and great price.I don't know yet for durability,  I just  using it 3 months."
188,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"This is a midrange phone, and can be forgiven a few shortcomings, but in 2023, there are plenty of phones that are not spectacularly fast, but are still smooth and responsive. My kids $125 Motorola, for example. This thing Hesitates. A lot. The tap I just tappedâ€¦ did the phone not register it? Did I miss the button? Is the phone still thinking about it?In terms of speed and responsiveness, my 3 year old pixel 4a outperforms it. Maybe the benchmarks donâ€™t reflect it, but this phone feels clunky.And so much bloatware. I shouldnâ€™t have to log into a third party site to change my wallpaper. So many apps reinventing androidâ€™s already perfectly good apps. A lot of them are hideable or removable. The UI tweaks are sometimes nice, but generally not much better than basic android. I do have to say that I like being able to type in my pin without hitting enter. So thatâ€™s nice.The fingerprint reader is adequate, but I much prefer the readers on the back of phones. This one misreads a lot and is a little slow. Or maybe the phone is just hesitant and the reader is plenty fast. Whatever.The camera is really nice, especially the wide angle but, agin, itâ€¦.. hesitated when you press the shutter button.Itâ€™s also heavy. Ugh. Take it back."
189,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I wanted a solid performing mid tier phone. I don't use the cameras extensively and don't game on my phones so most high end features are overkill. I use my phones for email, web browsing and as a phone. Everyone rates phones for their cameras and speed for running apps so buying this was a guess since no one rates the way I use it. This phone works well as a phone and it's fast enough for web and mail. Surprisingly 5g data is not always faster than 4g. Even on WiFi these aren't as fast as my 4 year old Moto G5. But when there's a good 5g source, it can get 150g downloads. The down ratings on this phone are the extremely finicky fingerprint reader (super tedious to set up and works 50% of the time for unlocking) and all the Samsung bloatware. I buy unlocked phones to avoid carrier bloatware, I don't want any from the manufacturer either. Give us a way to easily delete all the junk."
190,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Me llegÃ³ el celular, y me funciona muy bien. Se puede aÃ±adir el chip de cualquier compaÃ±Ã­a de celular, ya que esta desbloqueado."
191,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I had a lower end Samsung that was starting to show the signs of aging that we all eventually notice (and I will some day notice it with this phone too) and was reading about this model.  I tend to appreciate larger RAM and internal phone memory and this model more than filled those requirements, being more than double what my old phone was.  I'm not really a power user with my smart phones.  For me, they are my personal music player and electronic communications (text and email)  That's mostly it.  Maybe some online shopping and streaming things now and then.  Not much of a mobile gamer either, but I am tempted to see what this phone can do.  Compared to my earlier model I'm enjoying it.  Keeps up with everything I have asked it to do.  Heck, I was almost giddy at how easy it was to just move the sim card from my old model (which was with T-Mobile) and it just recognized this new phone no problem.  And the Smart Switch app worked like a charm again.  This is my 2nd Samsung phone now and I've been quite pleased.  It's the first 5G phone I've had.  The first phone with a fingerprint scanner (which was a little clunky for this newb to figure out, but I got there and it's really been pretty cool! So much easier than the passcode lockscreen and I love how certain apps will use it too)  I haven't played around TOO much with all the camera stuff.  All those lenses and such make it seem like it would go WAY above and beyond anything I'm going to be asking of it.  But maybe now is a good time to actually find out what it can do and play around with it.  I'm sure there is a LOT of untapped potential in this phone I currently have no idea about.  I think the price has dropped again since I bought this, but I have found it was worth that money that I paid and has me in the modern age of cell phones."
192,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I purchased this phone because I do not need a phone for music, gaming and work.  I only needed a phone to make calls, texts and photos.  This was a perfect fit for me without going to a dumb phone."
193,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"lost my galaxyS20 FE off the handle bars of my bike ,needed a cheap replacement and for 1/3 the price of the S phones it might be worth the savings .. so far (2 weeks ) it works well as long as you don't mind waiting for things to load . If your use too top of the line high speed this might not be the phone for you . I'm o.k. with waiting a second or too for things to load If I remember in a few months update this review.update :after having this phone a few weeks I'm not so is a little slow  seems to always have a problem connecting to Bluetooth devices, especially my cars factory radio . I have to un-pair and pair a few time . Could it be that the car is 5 years old ? maybe but every other phone I've used even my galaxy S7  connects right away . I might just return this phone and go with a used  galaxy note"
194,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Does  everything I need to to and at a great price.  You can spend a lot more but the benefit is small
195,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Second phone I've had in the last year,And yes this phone will call&text on at&t,But you will get an error message on every restart(No Big Deal)  But on this phone I didn't have visual voicemail,And was missing a video call button on the Dial Pad,And was missing a Wifi Calling icon on the pull down screen  So  anyway I got a at&t branded phone and everything is fine....BEWARNED from my experience TWO times in the last year,AND In a conversation with a AT&T customer service YES  unlocked phones will work with at&t..  Here's the kicker  NO NO NO phone will be 100% compatible with AT&T unless it is a AT&T branded Phone..."
196,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I almost didnâ€™t buy this phone because of a professional review I read that complained of â€œextremely sluggish performance.â€ But then I watched a video review that said it was among the very best of the under-$500 phones and that its plusses far outweighed the compromises that Samsung had made (yes, including performance) to keep the price down.  So based on that â€“ and the realization that Iâ€™m not exactly a power user â€“ I decided to gamble that it would meet my needs and that I could live with its performance limitations.  Iâ€™m very happy with that decision.Iâ€™ve streamed music and short videos, done regular phone calls and WhatsApp video calls, navigated using the GPS, texted, taken photos etc. and everything Iâ€™ve tried has worked just fine and without the slightest hint of sluggishness.The call quality is excellent â€“ better than my land line.  Video call quality is very good (or would be if my friend could learn to hold his phone steady).  Photo quality is good â€“ it doesnâ€™t have a telephoto lens (another one of the aforementioned compromises) but its zoom simulation is much improved over my old Samsung.  Battery life is excellent compared to what Iâ€™m used to â€“ I seem to use 15-25% of the battery in a typical day and it takes about a half hour with a non-high-speed charger to recharge that much.  And the folks at the Verizon store were very helpful (even though Iâ€™d bought the phone through Amazon) in transferring my phone# and moving all my data.So if youâ€™re a power user youâ€™ll probably need to spend $800+ for the phone of your dreams, but if youâ€™re a regular user like me Iâ€™m confident youâ€™d be very happy with an A53 5G."
197,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Like most about it. The screen is very sensitive. Don't have to actually touch it sometimes and it does something. Was also a learning curve with the Android 14 vs our old phone with 9. Over all it does what we need.
198,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,This is really a good phone. The battery life is great the screen is really good it is 1080p but pretty crisp. I have no issues reading with the Kindle app. I play call of duty mobile just fine as well. I think the phone is pretty snappy not as fast as an s22 but adequate. I think the camera is quite good for a budget phone. You should get the poetic case with kickstand there are 2 fronts one built in plastic screen protector and one open to use glass. It's a great case. To wrap up the phone does not have bleeding edge specs but will get the job done.  If you are heavy into mobile gaming or just want the best of the best spend 3 times more and get the top of line. Personally I am very pleased to have paid $325 on prime day its worth every penny of that price.
199,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A53 5G,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Great value for the money. I don't need all the bells and whistles, but this phone has lots of features, good processor and memory/storage and battery life. NO headphone jack, though, you'll need bluetooth ear buds. Camera is pretty good for a value phone. Speakers are good for a value phone."
200,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"UPDATE: 8/26/2022 at the end. Not great.Bought this for my Dad who needed to upgrade from his old Galaxy S7 Edge (also a security risk as it's no longer updated...yikes) and this was the most affordable option for him at that point in time that wasn't refurbished, used, or overpriced for what you're getting. (Man, there are a LOT of those.)Pros:-Battery life. (When you hear ""all day battery"" they ain't kiddin'. Motorolla (really Lenovo) gives you a big, beefy battery with this thing.)-USB-C. (Yay! No more having to futz around with Micro-USB.)-Fingerprint reader and face unlock.-Android 11! (I really don't like 12 and have missed 11.)-They actually give you a charger! (Take *that*, Apple!)Cons:-Performance isn't where it needs to be. (4GB of RAM sounds reasonable for Android, but it's kinda pushing it. The older 600 series Snapdragon is long in the tooth and showing its age, so it's not exactly a speed demon, itself.)-64GB of storage isn't exactly going to win any awards. (And much like any storage device with an operating system, the fuller it gets, the slower it runs. Use the Micro SD slot, people!)-Only 10w charging. (So no matter what brick you throw at it, it'll TurboCharge (their branding) but it won't be like a Google Pixel series phone, which is lightning fast by comparison.)-720p display. (Don't take that 1600 to heart, because you're not getting that. I'm not sure why they chose this display or this particular size, but it's a rough 720p as in it's barely there, but there nonetheless.)-Camera notch IN the display. (Not a cut-out, not at the top of the bezel, no. Smack-dab right in the screen (much like the Pixel 4/4a, onward.)-Screen is polarized. (If you wear certain sunglasses, you can't rotate this to landscape mode as you won't be able to see the screen. It's LCD and probably akin to a Nintendo Gameboy Color, but much better quality.)Overall thoughts:I can see why people had problems getting their Verizon service to work with this phone. I got it to work with a simple SIM swap but the texting was a pain as their texting services are now secured and this didn't secure them right out of the box. (I forget the setting, but it's in the Hamburger Bar settings menu, it's per user and not overall. It's a pain to work with, but it does work.) Phone calls and everything else (including E-911) work well, after finagling. So does Wifi calling. It's just a needless pain to set up, really.The performance is okay, good even, if you let the AI in the phone follow what you do. (Sounds like a security risk, but it's actually a caching mechanism allowing the phone to know what you use the most and giving it priority over everything else.) Kinda like how you can use Optane memory in an Intel-based computer to speed up a HDD akin to using a Hybrid drive. (In its current form/update, the phone reminds me of a Pixel 2 in overall power.)The screen could be better. You can see the individual pixels and the lines/rows they're in and they're so noticeable that you can actually be taken out of the moment with what you're watching/seeing when it happens. It is capable of displaying 1440p and 4k signals, still at 720p, but usually devices with smaller resolution screens get stuck at 480p or 720p signals and make the best of it while this can successfully take in those signals and at least cleans up the picture and makes it look like proper HD, even though it's at the low end of it. Buffering isn't nearly as bad because it's driving a 720p display, so movies and shows will load slightly faster because of it. (Within in reason. Some apps drag like they're being operated by snails until the stream fully loads. Ugh.)The lack of stereo speakers is a real pain. (I miss my Pixel for that alone.)I traded my Dad my phone (Pixel 4a) for his (this one) because I can use it better (this is a MASSIVE phone) and the Pixel works better for him. This is capable enough for most people and it's quite usable. The hotspot feature works (you have to have a subscription with your carrier to use it), it works with Android Auto (very sluggish start up time...bleh), and for A/V stuff, it works well enough.For the price? Solid phone. Especially when you consider it's brand new and not used or refurbished. That said, if you're fine with used/refurbished and want something with more power in the same price range, I recommend a Pixel 4a or 5/5a. Both will still be supported with updates through 2023 (possibly 2024) and have a solid feature set, whereas this will be using Android 11 for the foreseeable future (but with security updates!) and if you want Android 13 and beyond, you'll need a better/newer phone.I'm honestly more or less happy with it, the price was good for what you're getting (brand new), and it's a sturdy beast with a massive battery (by comparison). Recommended.UPDATE: Changing my final thought to mildly recommended. The phone still works, but the AI garbage is nothing but a sales pitch. The phone somehow seems to go slower, with some new feature or task you give it. The AI is supposed to be helping it learn which apps you use the most and adjusts itself accordingly. Well, the AI decided ""I'm going to use the slowest lane possible. We'll get there in 2 hours, instead of 30 minutes. Enjoy the ride!"" and boy, oh boy, does it crawl.It's gotten to the point where using Android Auto is just almost completely impossible. Button presses/taps can take upwards of 30-60 seconds to register! (That's insane when you're supposed to be using it as a GPS!) YouTube music lost most of my songs and refused to play them, asking me to redownload them (and it never did), so there would be entire skip spots during any journey. (I had to pull over once to figure out what the heck was going on.)Voice commands are sluggish, reaction times are the equivalent of a newbie going up against Tyson in his prime. You take the swing, but nothing happens until after you needed it many seconds ago.Even outside of Android Auto, it's sluggish. Loading Chrome can be a nightmare, given the page you're checking out. *sigh*Part of the problem is the storage. Much like on a computer, eMMC (which is what a phone uses) can slow down once it's too full, and all storage drives (regardless of the type) all have a recommendation of keeping things at, or below, 50% of the storage. Well, that's impossible on this phone because nothing will install to the SD card and the Motorola bloatware takes up a good chunk of your available space. You can max out the storage on this thing in no time flat.It's a great starter phone, it's fine if you're needing one in a pinch and can't afford more (believe me, I get it, I've been there more times than I can count.), but it's not going to be your #1 daily driver in the long run. Not unless you're fine with Motorola apps, chrome, some texting, and maybe some YouTube. Forget Android Auto, forget gaming, and forget packing a bunch of apps on here. It's clearly just a phone in a pretty Android wrapper."
201,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"I will start with the 2 worst, most functionally-deficient things. I ended up returning it because of the first defect. Maybe they will patch it?1. The status bar is all messed up. This phone has the camera cutout as a little dot on the left, so that space can't be used. But it ALSO prohibits icons in a center area as if it had a medium-sized notch there, which it doesn't. This leaves space in the status area for no more than FOUR notification icons before it does a little dot thing as if you are overflowing. Did they forget to change the software from a previous model which had a giant notch there? It makes this phone unusable for me. I need a status bar with room for a bunch of stuff I have going on constantly. I need to see download and message statuses for multiple things. My current phone, a Blu XL4, has an option to ignore the top sliver of the display with the garbage ""notch"" so I have a full-width status bar. Motorola does not, AND they messed up the default. There is no way to use this phone if you need more than 4 icons visible.2. There is no screenshot icon in the pull-down menu. I need to take a lot of screenshots, and the power/volume combo is both annoying to use and wears out the buttons. Motorola's new method requires you to tap-and-hold with 3 fingers on the screen. The problem with that is it activates buttons/links/etc on a lot of pages. So you will need to download some shady 3rd-party app with adds or whatever if you want to add a screenshot function. It also has a (not)""helpful"" menu which pops up every time you do a screen shot, which gets in the way.3. I don't use split-screen much, but if you do... you can't long-press the recent app icons to do this. Motorola's idea is to swipe from the center of the left edge of the screen (oh how clever, cut the screen in half!). Problem: THAT GESTURE IS ALREADY USED BY ALMOST EVERY APP to access menus. Did the genius who removed the long-press method to replace it with side-swipe not know this?Now some less-important details...One good thing: it does have double-tap to wake the display. This should be standard. It saves wear on the power button and is sometimes more convenient depending on how you are using the phone.You can't turn off a mystery feature which wakes the display in response to the slightest wiggle or movement.You can't turn of a wallpaper animation which stretches your wallpaper and displays it in a distorted form, and then shrinks it to normal temporarily when you touch menus. Your wallpaper will spend most of its time blurred.The fingerprint sensor can't lock the display. You must click the button. I don't know why. I had 2 other Motorola phones which would let you lock them by touching the sensor. Another way Motorola really wants you to click the power button constantly. The reason I prefer not to have the power button used for everything is because the only phone I had break in the past several years was a Moto E4, and the power button stopped working.About that camera... it's pretty good, but FYI it doesn't give you 48MP pictures (you kind of knew it wouldn't). They use a 48MP sensor and you end up with 12MP pictures. The idea is to reduce noise by averaging groups of 4 pixels. It works somewhat, and I like the pictures, but calling it a 48mp camera makes it sound much better than it is."
202,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"I initially bought this phone for a friend that said her phone died.  Then she said she didn't want it and ordered herself an S22.  So I figured I'd keep the phone for myself, and I'm glad I did.My everyday mobile phone is the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.  But the swines that designed the thing, followed Apple over the cliff and took out the 3.5 mm Headphone Jack, did away with removable storage, and put the fingerprint reader in the middle of the screen.  This phone, being a budget phone, choose to not jump on the bandwagon of taking away features and charging you more money.I use this phone as my primary media player.  It takes good enough pictures and videos, everything works as expected.  I put a 128 GB SD card with all my favorite movies.  And with Bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack, I get the best of both worlds.  I can receive calls with the Google Voice app, but again, corporate swings, took away the ability to make WIFI calls using the google voice app.It has the same size battery as the S22 Ultra, so on standby, it can go for up to a week without needing to charge.  And since there's WIFI just about everywhere these days, I use this phone about as much as my S22.I could go on and on about why you should buy this phone, but you should be aware of two points.  Its a budget phone, so speed is not its thing.  Also, some popular apps, for some reason, doesn't work on it.  The most notable is the Facebook Messaging app.  It loads but is unresponsive.  That aside, great budget phone.  Strong buy recommendation.Update.  All i had to do was update the Facebook messenger app and it started working again."
203,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"I bought this smart phone for my technophobe wife for her 72nd birthday. She has even figured out how to use some of the features, but mostly I thought she would appreciate the camera and she does. So do I! The phone is terrific, it runs every Android app I've installed, it is very flexible and reasonably secure, it mated up perfectly with the Bluetooth system in our 2012 Honda CRV, and the battery easily lasts 5 days even with a fair amount of use.  Couldn't ask for more."
204,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"I'm not a ""power"" user.  I do use it for biz and pleasure.  Mostly for communicating, phone, text, email, and the occasional file download.  Camera is also a necessity, and the quality this delivers is fine/excellent for my needs.  It's built well and the battery life is great.  A little larger in size than my previous version, but I've gotten use to it.  I'd buy it again.  For my needs, the battery life, picture quality, reliability, etc. have been fine after observing/using for the past 2 months.  And the price was right.  I'm not going to buy a $500 phone...ever.  Good luck."
205,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"I primarily care about reliability. I have stayed with the G Power for 3 or 4 years now, my entire household has them. After 3 years one had an issue where the screen started to fuzz out, so I replaced it with a new model. These phones have been worry free for us on t-mobile and att. Aside from that old phone, the others are now 2-3 years old and seem to take a beating fine.I should note that after seeing bad reviews of the 2022 version, I replaced the old phone with the screen issue with a 2021.Fingerprint on the side works great for me. I use a poetic case, fits great and leaves the fingerprint exposed for easy use. Thanks to Motorola for keeping budget-friendly unlocked phones on the market."
206,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"If you are used to Samsung phones this will be a learning curve.Intuitively, you will miss the Samsung layout and methods and procedures(navigating from one screen to the next, daily use of procedures/processes to get from one screen to the next etc).IMHO, Samsung does have a superior method and procedures compared to Motorala's.Not in everything though,  But this is software, Samsung in theory can incorporate some methods that Motorola does better.  There are probably just 1 or 2 things out of methods and  procedures that Motorola has more over Samsung.That said, this a good to one notch above good. It Works for the person that uses it for a phone and camera and other normal functions. High end users with top quality demands know they should go for what they really want. But this is a good phone for price.Good Buy!"
207,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"First Note: Iâ€™m switching from a Moto E4 to the Moto G Power 2021.The E4 began life as a Verizon prepaid offer that I switched to AT&T. Neither service gave good call performance from my rural home on the E4.I was considering switching back to Verizon but the signal and call quality on the unlocked Moto G Power 2021 has been a big improvement so I think I will leave it on AT&T prepaid. My call signal and quality went from zero to two bars and people telling me I was breaking up to reading two to four bars and clear conversations. That in itself is a big win.All I had to do to switch to the new phone was move the prepaid AT&T SIM from the old phone to the new. I set the old phone to back up everything to Google and let the new phone copy those apps and settings. In hindsight I wish I would have just backed up my contacts and manually installed the apps I use. It didnâ€™t save all my passwords anyways and Iâ€™m not sure it didnâ€™t install some system stuff I donâ€™t want. After the initial setup it consumed 21GB of internal storage. The old E4 only had 16GB and was at 14GB consumed after I cleaned it out and backed it up. Go figure?Battery consumption is great. The first day I had it on a lot and only ran it down to 50%. After a normal days use it is at 78%-82% left. I charge every night. The 3' cord and straight charger supplied is a disappointment. I plug my charger in behind my dresser and there isn't room for a charger that comes straight out and has a wire plugging straight into it. A 3' cord also won't reach from a standard height wall plug to the top of my dresser. I had to order a longer wire and use an old Samsung charger that plugs in from the side. A charger with side or bottom plugin with a 5' wire should be standard.Android 10 or Motorolaâ€™s implementation of it has been a challenge to get used to. Simple settings like changing the notification tone and volume for specific apps is buried deeper than it should be. The system should be intuitive enough you donâ€™t have to Google how to set it. It also has multiple nags and reminders I could do without. Some I have been able to turn off and others keep popping up each day. Copy and paste was turned off in the Gboard and I had to search for a way to turn it on. Thatâ€™s pretty stupid to think people would not want that feature on by default. It makes word insertions I canâ€™t get to go away sometimes. I think there is a way to turn it off but Iâ€™m going to have to research the Gboard settings further.I was hoping for a $200 upgrade on the camera but that is a disappointment. Trying to zoom in on something isnâ€™t much if any better than the old E4 and has produced some out of focus images. Regular picture and video taking is fine but not a big improvement over the old phone. One aggravating thing is when you switch it to video it doesnâ€™t want to switch back to photo. Sometimes itâ€™s easier to turn the camera off and restart it than to get it to switch back to photo. Oh, you have to make sure itâ€™s not set to return to the last setting used for that to work.The touch recognition of app shortcuts is inconsistent. One time they will open right up and another you might have to touch it 3 times. If you hold on it too long or touch it a second time too quickly a sub menu opens.The screen seems to turn dark in the sunlight. In bright sun it is impossible to see even at full bright. I just turned on adaptive brightness. I had to set it brighter for indoors and it automatically went to full bright outdoors but the sun isnâ€™t shining today.The signal and call quality is the only thing that makes this phone a keeper. If that had not been such an improvement I couldnâ€™t justify the higher cost of this phone."
208,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"For the price, you get a reasonable phone. I don't know why Motorola decided to significantly downgrade the 2021 over the 2020 model. My wife accidentally broke the screen on her 2020 and it isn't made anymore, so we ordered this model, despite the lower specs. As I said, for the price, it's acceptable, but it's the same price that we got the 2020 model for and it's just worse. Very frustrating..."
209,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"This is a solid phone. It does everything I need, and the battery life is truly impressive! I don't use my phone nearly as much as a lot of people, but I am very happy with it! If you are someone who is married to your phone, I can't speak to wherever this phone would work for you, but if you're like me and use your phone for talk, text, and some internet surfing, this fits the bill."
210,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,I use this to play music via blue tooth.
211,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,This is a good phone. Doesn't keep a three day charge. Half a day is what I get.I don't like face recognition or finger print. Haven't tried it
212,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"This phone is great bang for your buck. We have two of these and we're very happy with them. The battery life was excellent when I bought it. It does get a bit weaker over time, but still really good. The finger print reader works ok for the most part. It's a pretty fast phone with plenty of storage space. The cameras are great for the price point. Obviously there are more expensive phones with better cameras, but pretty happy with the image quality. The screen is bright and has nice color."
213,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"The phone works fine as a phone and browsing chrome or Facebook is fine too. Battery life is OK, not spectacular. The reception is so-so but that might also just be the carrier. The most disappointing thing is how slow the camera is. When you open it, it takes 5 seconds or so to wake up. Then it needs another 5 seconds before you can change any settings, like the flash. Then when you hit the button to take a pic, it's another 5 seconds before it actually takes the pic. And there have been instances where I heard the click and saw the flash, but the pic did not get stored, so now I have to check each time and make sure it worked. There's also a considerable delay when you're switching from pic to video. If you want to catch your kid or pet doing something cute, you won't be able to with this phone. The moment will have passed by the time the camera does its thing. I've had $50 phones work better than this, to be honest. Oh also apps often freeze up and then I get the pop up that lets me wait or shut it down. It happens at least once a day."
214,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"I'm loving how long my battery last between charges. I haven't used the fingerprint or face recognition but trading up from 32 to 64 leaves me lots of room for apps. This was a renewed phone but it looks brand new. I use my phone primarily for calls, text and looking things up so this is perfect for me."
215,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"This phone worked really well right out of the box. I'm on Verizon. After I inserted the SIM card and set it up on their website, I was able to make calls, message, and surf the net, problem free. So now six months later it is still problem free and the battery life is awesome. I listen to music at work for about 10 hours of a twelve hour shift, and still will have about forty percent battery charge left at the end of the workday. the fingerprint reader is flawless. I haven't used the facial recoginition feature yet. Best phone I've ever bought."
216,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"Bought this phone for my mom who was having trouble using her current phone. The Moto G Power has been awesome and super easy for her to use. The battery has lasted a long time and it was super easy to move over all her information. Overall, very happy with this purchase."

219,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"Fantastic phone for the price, great screen size, great battery life even when gaming all day its more than enough, the camera is half decent. Definitely worth the price especially since its unlocked!"

222,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"Update 2/27/22- After deciding to give up downloading Spotify on my phone, I just said forget it and decided to play it on my chrome browser! so all isn't completely over. I was almost going to make another big purchase for an iPod touch 7th generation! Whew. Glad I avoided that. Otherwise this phone is just ok. I still DONT recommend it for all the hassle it puts you into for downloading certain apps like spotify and rainbows shop. I have to use these on a browser now!! And Snapchat STILL can't download. Which annoys me. Phone is not recommended but it's ok for now. It has a cool feature like a three finger screenshot, which I think just comes with android 11. Still cool though. The finger scanner being on the power button is cool too. The camera is just OK. It takes nice photos. I like how it has night mode.Hours into getting this phone completely set up, switching my sd and sim card, getting somehow magically charged 30 for getting my phone switched through call by metro, this GOD DAMN phone PATHETICALLY DOWNLOADS, let alone downloads anything at all.It's fast, I'll give it that. Cameras just OK, it's not bad. But DOWNLOADS? And I've tried literally EVERYTHING. 179 DOLLARS DOWN THE DRAIN OF CAPITALISM for this piece of pathetic S@$T do not be able to download simple crap like Spotify or Snapchat.I can forgive it for not having wifi calling. I can forgive it for not having a top of the line camera (I don't even care about that). But I seriously, seriously, seriously seriously seriously SERIOUSLY cannot forgive this phone for not being able to do an EXTREMELY SIMPLE TASK like DOWNLOADING A DAMN APP.It can download games. It can download it's heaps of useless Google f#ckSH@T crap no one uses such as ""Google fit"" ""google this google that"" but when it comes to simply downloading literally the simplest of things on GODS GREEN inDUSTRIALIZED EARTH, such as literally SPOTIFY of all things...I BEHEAD THIS PHONE! I SEND IT TO THE GULAG!! THIS PHONE NO LONGER DESERVES TO LIVE!!!Music is my literal life and I will not tolerate not having Spotify!! I refuse to use anything else! I even have a premium student subscription, AND not to mention I also have a Hulu and showtime subscription WITH my Spotify subscription!!! What's the point of that if I can't even use the app?? This phone literally disappoints me. Severely. I'm extremely upset with it's downloading speed.If you're going to get a phone, get one of the ulefone notes, or a galaxy, or a LG or Samsung even. Steer clear from the moto g power series. Or if you're going to get one get a Moto G Power 2020. This phone is a disappointing, shameless downgrade from anything holy. Seriously, there are better phones that are at least FUNCTIONAL for basic needs. I severely hated my Alcatel just to flush myself into another pile of S@#$&!"
223,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"Full disclosure: This is my first android device since having iPhones since the 4. I'm coming from an iPhone 7 that I would have to charge 3x a day and got fed up. I currently use Mint Mobile (GSM) and it works great on this device.Pros:Price: inexpensive yet capable.Battery life: I can go about 3 days without charging with normal use. I don't really stream anything on it, but I do use it heavily for web browsing on the go.Screen: Sharp and big largeFunctionality/gestures: The gestures are neat and the built in moto stuff isn't overbearing.Fit and finish: Well built and durable. I have a Spigen case on it and it fits well. Overall good looking device.Fingerprint reader/buttons: responsive and work well. Have not had an issue using biometric recognition.Operating system: No issues here except for the fact that I was new to Android. It does work well and functions as advertised without any weird bloatware. The built in moto stuff was actually helpful in the transition.Cons:THE CAMERA: It stinks. sometimes there is a second delay before it takes a picture. It lags out and usually the pictures are pretty grainy. For a phone that has 3 lenses on it, I was surprised that the quality is lacking in that department.Performance: It's not the fastest thing around, but it gets the job done for the price. Sometimes it will get a little low on RAM. If you're a mobile gamer, this might be a concern to you.Overall, I'd give this device a 4.3/5. It performs well and WiFi calling is supported by my carrier. The biggest thing is the camera, I just wish it was better. All in all, it is a good daily driver, or phone to have around in case you break your main one."
224,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"Revised 7/15/21  After a visit to my T-mobile store and the tech showing me how to find the navigation option to use the buttons option and not gestures I am revising this review.  The battery will fast charge and holds a charge well.  I am using this phone for my backup phone and for reading my kindle books when my primary is on the charger.  Generally get about 2 to 2.5 days per battery charge.  I have used the camera some and it is a good camera on this phone.  The navigation thing was a big deal for me. Not using those dumb gestures made the decision for me to keep this phone as my backup.Revised 7/15/21About the only good thing about moto G Power 2021 is the longer life battery.  The camera is way too complex for easy learning, The swipe from left side or right side to go back a screen is poorly thought out and poorly executed.  The swipe interferes with the kindle app when trying to see book recommendations.  The screen scrolling up and down is uncontrollable and will all of a sudden speed up the scrolling.  Worst of all is the sound control which is basically non existent.  I purchased this phone on 6/8/21 and only a week later, the notification sound is gone, the speech to text mic sound is almost gone so it is hard to tell when the mic is active.  Keyboarding in a phone call you get almost no sounds at all of the keys being pressed.  All sounds were ok until I updated the motorola system update about 6/10/21.  I did finally find how to fix the alt sounds so they are ok. All attached to one control.The left right swipe to go back a screen is the exact same gestures used in a kindle book to move back or forward a page. So the motorola gestures interfere with the klndle book.  The older G series used a back arrow button which would move you back to the kindle menu allowing access to the home, library and store buttons in the book but with the G Power 2021 that is almost impossible to get to anymore.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE.  This is  first for me and moto phones.  This one is going back for a refund.  NOT returned."
225,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"Despite what the top review says, this phone does support (with no user actions needed) Wi-Fi calling. It switches to it automatically when I get within range of my home network.As far as other features of the phone goes:1. The 3 day battery life is not marketing. I heavily used it over 3 days and it was still going strong when I finally relented and plugged it back into the charger.2. Fast and smooth. Lots of storage and memory. No complaints there.3. Voice quality is excellent.4. Screen is decent.5. Yes, it has a headphone jack. It is absurd we have to check for that right now but there you have it.6. Alas, it has no off screen navigation buttons, and defaults to clumsy and mostly-activated-by-accident gestures instead of having on-screen navigation buttons, but you can change it so it shows on-screen navigation buttons instead.6. Why is there a camera *in* my screen making the entire top of the screen unusable? Oh, I know, because Apple did it. Did you ever stop to think that Apple stopped knowing what it was doing years ago?7. Too thin, likely to break unless you put it in a case.8. No bezel so the phone has to be put on a flat surface if you want it to interpret touches accurately.The 2021 Moto G Power continues the current trend of removing useful features and ""adding"" stuff nobody asked for or wants, but at least Motorola are doing this more slowly than the other phone manufacturers. For that reason, the Moto G series might be the least awful range of smartphones on the market right now. So I give it a reluctant thumbs up."
226,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,My parents are loving this phone with all the easy to understand features
227,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"It's fast, doesn't drop calls, fantastic picture's (my hands shake), I can't believe the battery. After 6 hours, if you don't use it much, it's still at 95%. My old Moto would have been at 35%. Very pleased."
228,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"I bought this phone to replace my Moto Z4 because the Z4 split in half along the left side of the phone and I could see the battery through the split.I purchased this phone based upon price and a few reviews I read that complimented the phone. I have to say, the battery is outrageously good. I'm not sure why, but it compares like this. I always leave my phone in the kitchen when I go to bed. If I set my Z4 on the countertop with 100% battery at 8pm, and picked it up at 4am the next day, the battery would usually be at 80%, plus or minus. If I put the Moto G Power on the countertop at 8pm, and pick it up at 4am the next day, the battery is usually 95%, plus or minus.During the normal work day, I plug in my phone on the way to work and take it back to 100 %. If I left the Moto Z4 unplugged at the office with regular use (texts, email checks, no social media) the battery would be at 60% by 1pm and I would plug it in at work for about an hour or so to get it back to 85/100% before leaving for home. The Moto G Power, with the same usage at work, will be at 92% at 1pm, and I don't have to plug it in at all until I leave for home and plug it in in the truck.I have left the Moto G Power unplugged all day on a weekend and it barely goes under 90%. Maybe 85%, plus or minus. Could possibly be app related, but I don't know for sure. The only app I don't use on the new phone is the ""News"" app. Decided not to install it this time, but that's about it.Even took this phone to Cheap Trick/Blue Oyster Cult concert here in SoCal and left with battery around 79% after Snaps and Instagram posts during the concert. Usually concerts would kill my phone battery or at the very least take the battery to 20% plus or minus.Camera is okay. Not as sharp as the Moto Z4, and coloring could be better too, but it works. Selfies are great with the G Power as the lens is wider than the Z4.Everything else works great for a $200 plus or minus phone. I highly recommend it for a value purchase"
229,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"This phone has been a really good phone overall until a couple of weeks ago when the phone started to behave erratically, clicking and scrolling on its own, going haywire, etc. Last night I saw that the phone was swollen (Still has the original battery) on the charger (original charger) and I picked it up and started to take it outside, the battery burst into flames causing me to drop it on my bed (burned a hole in mattress) and my wife who was nearby grabbed the burning phone and threw it onto our wooden floor where it exploded and started streaming out smoke and toxic fumes. I had to evacuate my family from our home and put out the fire, it took hours before our home was aired out enough to return.I know that any lithium battery has this potential but we received no warning message at all that something was wrong with the battery. I am not sure if there is proper overcharge protection built-in because something obviously failed in my case.For the time being, I am going to be skipping Motorola brand phones as I have barely owned the phone over a year and now I have to not only pay for a new phone but a new mattress and a burned floor slat."
230,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"I got this phone for work. It is easy to use and I don't have to worry about my phone dying, but I'm not a fan of the fingerprint reader on the side. Other than I like it."
231,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,Exelente producto
232,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,Good product
233,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"I've been using Motorola phones for a while, and I buy the phones for our family plan. So, this is probably the tenth Motorola I've bought over the years. I'm coming from a Moto One, and so far, I like this phone.Here are my highs and lows so far:HIGHSNice, large screen. This is a fairly big phone.Expandable memory -- I bought a 128GB MicroSD that worked great.The navigation and movement are very smooth.Moto Gestures: I've always loved ""twist"" to open camera and ""chop"" for flashlight. Very useful!Nice pictures -- the quality is plenty good enough for me.Very large battery. Keeps a long charge.Water resistance.Side-mounted fingerprint sensor works well.Comes with a quality wall charger and cable.I love that Motorola doesn't load the phone down with a bunch of preloaded apps like Samsung does.LOWSThis phone might be too big for some people with smaller hands.Slick, plastic body. You'll probably want a case. (I love the Rugged Shield cases.)Android 10 Gesture Navigation. If you don't like swiping all the time, you can turn the old three-button navigation on in Settings.Overall, I'm still a happy Motorola customer. I will update this review should I encounter any problems."
234,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"I got this phone about four months ago. I am an amateur photographer and  I take TONS of pictures. In recent years I have only used my phone to take photos, and my phones have been pretty low on the spectrum, resulting in frustratingly low quality photos.  I had planned a trip to Hawaii in June for my 60th birthday and was debating on getting a nice new digital camera, or just get a new phone with a better camera.  For the sake of ease and convenience I decided to go with getting a new phone and ended up with this Motorola.  I could not be happier with my purchase!  I got the most incredible pictures and videos from Hawaii! Some of the pictures I got from my helicopter tour of Kauai were so spectacular they look professional! There were very few pictures I took that could not be edited into a beautiful photo!The phone is fast and reliable, and also has the best battery life life of any phone I've had in the past. I highly recommend it."
235,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"The phone itself is great.The issue is the description said new, unlocked phone.  The phone we received was clearly used, had fingerprints all over the box, the box was clearly used, the tape seals had been cut and retaped.  Inside the box had been repacked and the SIM removal tool was not included.When the phone was powered up, it was already set up at least once.  The phone had been put into developer mode and had all sorts of Boost Mobile apps installed.  Later I noticed that once I set it up, the boot screen said Boost Mobile.  I may have just missed it during the first boot.  It would make calls on Verizon, but would not send or receive SMS messages.This was clearly a used phone that had been put into developer mode and was a Boost Mobile phone, not an unlocked version.  Clearly, someone returned the wrong phone or the seller is reselling used phones as new phones."
236,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"I've been using this phone for about two weeks, maybe longer. When I read that it had up to 3 days of battery life, I thought they were kidding. It is not a joke. I've been going a couple days at a time without charging, and the phone's battery has not gone below 35%. I cannot speak for heavy gamers, because I have only downloaded light games. If you're looking for a phone that can handle hardcore gaming and streaming, you'll have to look for another review, because I have not tried it. I do, however, listen to Spotify almost constantly-- and the lowest that the battery has gone from a full charge is around 70% after a full day's listening. That with other usage (i.e. small games, browsing, social media, etc.).A thing that should be mentioned is that the back of the phone doesn't snap on and off like the Moto G 4. Not sure if others see it as a good or bad thing, but I'm putting it out there just for knowledge's sake.I have not tried using facial recognition, but wow-- the fingerprint sensor. I've used this feature on other phones previously, but none of them compare to this one. It is in such a convenient location, and you can have up to four or five fingerprints saved into your phone at a time.An issue that is often brought up with phones, is overheating. With my last phone, which was also a Moto, this was one of my main issues. Well let me tell you... my phone has not once gotten warm. My Moto G Power 2021 handles applications so well, that it has not even gotten warm, let alone overheating.If you are a returning user of Moto's, you might be hoping that it'll have certain features from other phones. There are all of those and more that you can enable. (i.e. chop for flashlight, double-click power button for camera, hold three fingers on screen for screenshot, lift to silence incoming phone call, double-tap to wake from sleep, etc.). There are more, but I don't want to type too much.So far, I love this phone. My last Moto lasted for several years, and I have great expectations for this one as well."
237,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"I bought this for my daughter as a starter phone. However, after playing with it for an hour, I can hardly tell the difference between this and the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G I got for myself! The screen is actually bigger and looks great, the touch screen is smooth and responsive, it has an expandable micro SD card slot, and the camera is 48MP. And, it had no issues with texting right out of the box. I stuck a Mint Mobile SIM card in it and everything worked perfectly. So apps don't run as silky smooth as on a pricier Android phone and it's not waterproof, but at this price point that doesn't matter. If you use it to do all the normal smartphone things - text, call, social, apps, streaming, this phone fits the bill. It's a great phone at any price point, hands down. I had no idea a phone with these features and high quality could be had for this price. So why did I spend five times as much on a Galaxy? I need to go ponder that now."
238,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"What did I like, well everything....tired of my apple foundation....this phone is similar to my iphone xs max & a bit bigger....never liked android phones, but now they have come back strong....the moto g has everything and more....none of this crap with itunes to load my mp3's [30k] worth of tunes....same for pic or videos....small learning curve and fine tuning to my likes...hate google, but the play store is better than apples's app store, sorry , in my opinion....I have has iphones since the 3g and will continue it as a backup....apple needs to lose the itunes portion of the mp3,vid and pics loading and players for iphones and stop with trying to control the users every move....anyhow, setup this moto to your likings and you will love it....7/1/22.....Update....had this phone now for over a week and seems to work flawlessly.....my only issue is when I take a pic and want to sent it NOW, can't, gotta go to photo's and select it or start a new message and select the pic....iphones, you take pic and send....small annoyance but I'll get over it...enjoy7/1/22..... Another update couldnâ€™t believe that the phone updated it and when I took another picture it had the word share and when I pressed on share it brought up my contacts and I was easily able to text my photo without any extra step so now the phone is absolutely perfect."
239,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"I've had this phone for almost a year. I had a Moto Z2 Force for three years before that. I don't think this phone will last that long. The screen has developed some dead spots near the corners, and the phone cannot multitask, especially if I'm running Waze or Maps. In other words, if I set up a road trip on Maps, and I try to listen to music or a podcast, the phone will freeze and reboot at some point into the drive. Maybe 3 hours in, maybe 30 minutes.The big plus? Battery life. 3 days is overly optimistic though. Maybe if I have it in battery saving mode and I don't use it for 3 days. But I can get through a 12 hour shift with normal use (phone calls, gaming on breaks, Google and Wikipedia searches on the clock), and that will use the battery generally from 100% to 65%. I only ever charge it at night, and I never have to worry about bringing a charger everywhere I go. Almost worth the massive size which makes one-handed texting virtually impossible for my average-sized hands.Bring back the small phones!"
240,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,I was kind of disappointed after the prior model I had so much long life in the battery. This model does not.  It's still a pretty good phone overall
241,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"This is my third Motorola phone to use with Verizon prepay.  This phone does not allow easy switch between apps.  It completely closes you out of one to go into the other.  So far, that's my only complaint on any of the Motorola phones I've had and is a new issue with this one."
242,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,I took 3 days for Verizon to recognize the moto g power and many hours on the phone with them.
243,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"I had the Moto G7 Power 2019 version, and I bought this version to upgrade that older phone.  Overall, Motorola makes a great phone; some people would say this is a ""budget phone"", but to me, it doesn't feel like it at all.The pictures come out very clear and detailed, the videos are very good quality (mp4), the phone is very fast - even with multiple apps open at once, etc.The only thing I've noticed that is a slight difference (in performance) is the battery life.  The 2019 model definitely lasts longer than this one; however, the 2019 model also does not take as good of pictures or videos, and it also is nowhere near as fast, so everything is a trade-off.Overall, I really like this phone.  A buddy of mine was looking to upgrade his phone, and I recommended this one to him (he used mine to get a feel for it), and he bought one as well, and likes it as well.In my opinion, you really can't go wrong with this phone, as long as you're just looking to use it to use Maps, texting, simple web browsing (like looking at Amazon for something to buy for example), taking pictures or videos, etc.I run Linux (Xubuntu 20.04 LTS), and this phone connects seamlessly to my computer.  All I have to do is select ""File Transfer"" from the notification drop-down item, and it shows up without any issues.I also helped my buddy set up his phone, and he runs Windows 10, and this phone connected just fine to that as well.If this review helped you, please give me a thumbs up.  Thanks"
244,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"The original purchase was a locked phone and caused me big headaches of having to work through it with my service carrier.  After much troubleshooting, my service carrier assured that the sim problems were being caused by the phone being locked.  I returned it and got a replacement and new one worked like a charm, right out of the box.Not happy about having a received a non-functioning phone to begin with, but I am very pleased with the way the replacement was handled.  I received the replacement home very quickly along with instructions and label for returning the original one."
245,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"Overall, I'm quite pleased with this phone; I got it during a Black Friday sale for $170 and I think it's a fantastic phone for the price. The battery, while somewhat slow to charge, lasts for days on end; apps work well, processing is fast, the screen is good quality, etc. The camera, while it has a lot of nice options like portrait and macro mode, is more pixellated than the description suggests; the ""quad-pixel"" technology is definitely code for ""we wanted to make this seem better than it is"". The camera isn't bad, to be clear - if you aren't someone who wants to take high-quality photos on a phone, don't worry about it, it's a reasonable phone camera. The other thing I wish I had realized about this phone before buying it is how *big* it is. My last phone fit comfortably in my hand, whereas this one actually causes some strain. You can minimize this by buying a ring or pop for the back, and turning on the ""one handed keyboard"" in settings."
246,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"I had the 2019 G7 power and really liked the long battery life and bright screen so I figured I'd go with this one since my battery was getting tired quickly and why not upgrade before the phone does die completely. This new phone is very nice. Little awkward at time to hold with one hand especially with a case on it. One big factor why I buy Motorola is because of the price. Can't beat that deal for a pretty good smartphone. I can't see spending more then $300 for a phone. Camera is ok, not as Good as I had hoped but it's good enough for the little bit I take. The biggest issue I have with this phone is the power/fingerprint. Sometimes it unlocks with my finger and sometimes it doesn't. Never had a single issue with my previous phone with the back cover fingerprint. But this power button fingerprint has hiccups. I had to add the thumb to it because it stopped registering my index finger which was the first finger I had to set up. The brightness of the screen is terrible. Have to have it on full bright most of the time which drains battery. If your outside you can hardly see the screen on middle brightness.Overall I like the phone. Got it for sale on $229 so couldn't pass that up. If you don't mind some features that are not as good as the original phones then you'll be happy with this purchase. I do find that this phone takes better pictures then my brother's $800 iphone so thats a plus. I would recommend this phone to someone getting into entry level smartphones and on a tight budget."
247,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"This phone holds up so much better compared to a Samsung, the specs are mid range, which is acceptable for the average user. The speaker is not as horrible as previous versions. And battery last forever. And like previous versions these phones can take some abuse, but I would still buy a case because there are gaurntees in this life. But definitely worth the money there asking for it. Don't use facial recognition, or fingerprint scanner on any phone I've ever owned ain't gonna start now. So I can't tell you how well either those things work."
248,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,This is a good cheap phone but the camera is totally trash.
249,Motorola,Moto G power,64 GB,Android 10.0,6.6 Inches,"Motorola used to make really good low budget phones, but in the past few years they have been getting sluggish, de-featuring the camera and generally making the phones less enjoyable to use than phones of a similar price a few years ago."
250,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"Iâ€™m a college student and my phone screen went black on me a couple weeks ago, so I was kind of screwed without a phone and my data, but this one arrived within a few days (it was half a day late but overnight since it was set to arrive 8PM- wasnâ€™t a huge deal) and it works perfectly. I was able to get all my data transferred through iCloud and itâ€™s just like my old phone. I believe it came with a screen protector seeing as the screen looks raised which is nice. There are a couple tiny tiny scratches on the protector but thatâ€™s to be expected with the refurbished phones, that would be the only flaw I see. Battery seems even better than my old phone and I was worried about maximum charge/capacity only being around 80% but it hasnâ€™t been an issue at all!"

Â Update: the seller contacted me later the following day after reaching out to them and apologized and is going to replace it. It could have just been an oversight so Iâ€™ll give it a go.Original: This was advertised as excellent condition and probably should have been categorized as good condition. The screen and back glass are both scratched and dinged up so much that it glitters in the light.The shipping was super fast, it came packaged well, and the price was decent. It seems to work perfectly otherwise, but dings in the screen can definitely affect the overall strength and make it less durable. This is for my 15 year old son so durability is a must.I sent a message to the seller yesterday but havenâ€™t heard back yet. It hasnâ€™t been 48 hours for a response, not faulting them for that, but I may just return it. It seems either they didnâ€™t review it well before re-selling it, or they didnâ€™t think the damaged glass was a quality issue. Iâ€™m not completely sure I want a replacement from them, but if they end up reaching out before I return it Monday, I will update."
253,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"Amazing!!! I got a yellow for myself and a black for my husband and they are flawless!!! Long battery life, not a single mark anywhere on either phone or screen, and they came with glass screen protectors on! Will definitely return to this seller when we are ready for the 13!"
254,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,Phone looks great for the price. Only disclaimer is read the comments I got the excellent condition and the screen more then likely was replaced due to glue still around the outside with fuz on it and light wear around the edges. Doesnâ€™t come with Apple box or a Apple brand charger. Overall Iâ€™m satisfied with the price and look just be aware of what your getting.
255,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"Purchased a refurbished red iPhone 11. Extremely happy with the phone. Everything works great. There was a small scratch on the screen, but not noticeable when phone is in use. Battery stays charged for hours."

Came with a screen protector already on it too.
257,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"Phone is in near perfect condition. Only complaint is the charging cube that came with the phone was cheap and got overheated as soon as the phone was plugged in (just leave it out). I really enjoy Apple as a brand because it is honestly just so easy once you are used to it, but I am not someone that needs the newest and just don't really care to pay for the newest. Amazon providing refurbished tech is great for the environment as well as for penny pinchers like me."
258,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"I needed to replace my teens Iphone and absolutely refuse to pay the gross prices of new phones, especially for teens who tend to break or damage phones easier. I almost bought a refurbished phone from Ebay until I saw on Google that Amazon sold them. Amazon has a better return policy and Iâ€™m very familiar with Amazon and never use Ebay so I felt better buying here. So far the phone has been fine and as expected. We put a case on it immediately so if there were any cosmetic flaws they werenâ€™t very noticeable. Also able to finance through here so can pay overtime which is great and Iâ€™ll pay it off sooner than my financing terms but still better than putting on a credit card or paying full price up front. Hope it holds up, had about a month now so canâ€™t say much else."
259,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"I upgraded from an iPhone 6s as a birthday present to myself. I wasnâ€™t willing to pay over $400,  didnâ€™t want to see visible wear & tear, needed the phone to be purple. And with this purchase???! BAYY-BEEğŸ—£ got everything I asked for! I love my new phone and Iâ€™m so grateful to myself (and the company who I purchased from) for taking the time to find this gem ğŸ’. This was a fast ship too, ordered on 11/15 got it 11/17. Do yourself a favor & take advantage of this deal ğŸ”¥â€¼ï¸-Aria"
260,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"Writing this review after having the phone for a few weeks. Itâ€™s awesome. I hate buying refurbished and renewed because I like the â€œnewâ€ feeling you get when buying something never before used (I know lol) but this is the next best. If you donâ€™t have the money for an actual new one, I highly recommend this one"
261,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,Almost perfect condition! 92% battery life! The only thing was a tiny scratch on the front that isnâ€™t very visible in the first place and disappeared completely when I put on a screen protector. If you want to save yourself a couple hundred dollars I highly recommend buying one of these!
262,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"the phone is great! it came with a screen protector. the screen protector had minor scratches and so was some of the camera, but that was expected with a refurbished. i had a 7 plus so this is quite of an upgrade but i love it! it did NOT come with a sim card but did come with the thing to open it & a charger/box piece. itâ€™s also unlocked so it was the easiest thing to set up. i love this phone, thank u cell surfers!"
263,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"Screen came slightly popped out from the phone and there was a minor dent on the side.Other than that there was no other problems, batters was at 91% and face id was working."
264,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"Bought this phone for my 17-year-old son. He asked for a brand-new phone, and I laughed. He loses just about everything. Getting this phone was a compromise and he had the advantage because the phone is perfect. No scratches on screen or back and battery is between 90-98%. I've heard buying reconditioned phones is a risky venture. Not in this case. It was everything they promised and more."
265,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"I was very skeptical about purchasing a phone through Amazon but I took a risk and it was worth it. The phone itself was clean, not scratched, and looks completely new. Wasnâ€™t disappointed and would definitely buy from this company again in the future."
266,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"I was hesitant to purchase a used phone, and it worked out very well. The iPhone looks perfect, and the yellow does not disappoint. This is my big move from Android to Apple, and it has been seamless. I am very impressed with what Amazon has delivered. Great job!"
267,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,Pretty good for now. Expected more for the â€œexcellent conditionâ€ as the phone has a little scratch on the screen
268,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,Phone arrived in excellent working condition. Seller is reliable and responsive. Would recommend purchasing a refurbished phone from this seller before paying full price for something new. Great deal on the iPhone 11 in like-new condition!
269,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"elular me llegÃ³ perfecto sin rayones, limpio entre otras cosas muy bueno, pero en el momento en el q reviso la baterÃ­a, esta se encuentra en 78% y se supone q pague por uno q deberÃ­a venir 90% a 100%, esta fue mi Ãºnica molestia"
270,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"Besides the few nicks which don't affect it at all, my iPhone 11 is in top shape. Works as promised. The camera is amazing. the fingerprint is okay but the facial recognition is where it is at. Amazing detail for the retina display and tons of useful features and apps. It was really easy to set up. the generic cable and power brick both work great. Though the cable is a little on the short side. But since I previously had an iPhone SE, I happen to still have longer cables. And now I can make full use of my home pod mini. The price is well worth it with how slight the damage was. Unfortunately it doesn't come with a case. But I am sure to get one soon. Bluetooth on this device is amazing reaching every corner of where I live without caring around the device. I just wanted to test it out. The best feature is the battery which charges in about half an hour. And lasts all day. That is with a heavy battery use live wallpaper. I switched from Android and don't miss it."
271,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"The telephone works prefect. I did come with small scratches that you can see from further than 12 inches on the top right hand side of the screen, but it seemed to not matter since it is refurbished.  What matters is that everything about the telephone works."
272,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,This was my first phone I purchased without any parent money and let me tell it was worth it I still have it is unlocked. I still use it i recently just used it in Korea it still works great I had it for almost a year now
273,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,i like the phone its like a brand new phone witch was fantastic i found close to no scratches or scuff marks whatsoever. but only my phone battery capacity was 78%  but i can just buy a Certified iphone battery online for like 20-30 dollars and replace it :D.  9/10  i would show pictures but my computer dosent have a camera. but i 100% recommend buying this product.
274,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"It works fine, but the problem is the speaker which it wasnâ€™t loud enough. For the rest of this iPhone, it works fine."
275,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,Was skeptical to get one a renewed iPhone . Decided to try it ordered an iPhone 11 64 gb black . Receipt it in 2 days . Got it upon inspection of the phone canâ€™t expect perfect condition thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars it had a little hair scratch on lower side of the phone canâ€™t really see  but since I applied a screen protector canâ€™t see it at all ğŸ˜. Around the camera lens it has a few light scratches but Also canâ€™t see it hardly noticeable. The battery life on mines says 87% not to bad I think but letâ€™s see how that goes . Iâ€™m not a heavy daily user so could be a problem for other people. I connect it to my t mobile account and itâ€™s working everything else works great camera speakers sound face recognition. Great buy to save money on new iPhone. . Would I recommend it ? Yes . But everyoneâ€™s experience is different. They give 90 days to return it or exchange it .
276,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"Face ID works well ,only complaint is the battery life was 84% when delivered and the back screen light dims from time to time but itâ€™s a good phone ! Came with charger and screen protector!"
277,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,This is my everyday phone now. I love it. However I did switch from android to iPhone and I have no complaints so far. Good phone works amazing even if your on the phone all imlay it doesnâ€™t drain that fast
278,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,Phone works great. Iâ€™d buy buy a refurbished phone again. This one does respond to touch slowly on occasion.
279,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,I was nervous ordering this phone but I really needed it and it came fast and so far so good the phone had no scratches screen is beautiful no cracks came with the screen saver Iâ€™m satisfied with my purchase THANK YOU

288,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"The phone came in good condition and works fine.But when you are setting it up i recommend setting it up manually,the quick start can freeze the phone and you would have to reset it.Other than that itâ€™s a great phone and when buying keep in mind it does not come with the SIM card.Super good!"

Been using it for some days it works great! Shipment was received inside a bubbled envelope but the phone was inside a plastic box, so safe. I would reccomend this seller."
292,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"I got the white iphone 11, i haven't even had it for a month and it started to ghost touch, i have updated it, changed the screen protector and case. However there are no scratches on the body or screen, basically brand new, i have also noticed that in the top right corner that the screen has started to lift up. kind of disappointed. but other than that it is a good phone."
293,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from a refurbished device but most comments were pretty positive. I wasnâ€™t happy that mine had a few visible blemishes on the screen and was about to return it but decided on keeping it because of the price. I applied a screen protector and case and it looks almost as good as new. Battery life is 88% but still lasts a full day no problem. I did have the idea of replacing the battery as soon as I bought it because my iPhone 8 was awful at 83% but I donâ€™t feel the need just yet because battery is really great. Overall Iâ€™m glad I got this because I really needed to upgrade my iPhone 8.
294,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"Como si fuera nuevo, hasta el dÃ­a de hoy funciona bien."
295,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,Great option for a cheaper iPhone! Battery life is at 87% and the phone looks brand new. $300 for an iPhone 11 is not bad if you can buy at the right time
296,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,Everything fine except the fact that the phone battery life is lower than my iPhone 6 ğŸ¤¦â€â™€ï¸ğŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸ğŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜’
297,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,Works as promised. The camera is amazing. the fingerprint is okay.  Battery life is ok but not great.  The phone is in great condition and is perfect for kids who tend to be less careful with the device.
298,Apple,IPhone 11,64 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,16 year old Nephew .....wanted wanted  wanted an IPhone....  There is no way I could get him the one he really wanted.... So we went thru the Refurbished ones and he found this one...and so far ....he is happy.

300,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"The price on this phone was very good when I bought it and now it is so low, at only 149 bucks, I'm considering buying a second as a backup in case I need another phone even though I already own an iPhone 11. This was purchased to replace my second phone, a Moto G Power 2020. The Moto G Power 2020 is a very good phone with a larger battery, but I needed a phablet with a stylus, and a faster processor, and a bigger screen. The Moto G Stylus 2021 also has better specifications than the Moto G Power (the exception being its lack of stereo speakers). While the Moto G Stylus 2021 does not have an AMOLED screen the resolution/color profile of the 6.8"" Max Vision FHD LCD display is excellent. There is the issue of the screen being a form of hardened tempered glass instead of any type of Gorilla Glass, not even one of the older versions, so a glass screen protector is a must.I've included benchmarks run for this phone; its Qualcomm Snapdragon 678 processor yielding very good results for the price. I've also included a photo taken with the phoneâ€™s rear-facing camera. As you can see the photo has a full range of tones, excellent resolution, and excellent detail. The camera can yield surprisingly fine results in good light, but your mileage may vary as I have a lot of experience in photography and so made specific decisions as to what settings to use before taking any photos with the phone. The phone can also create good photos in low light just donâ€™t expect them to compare to photos taken using daylight.My iPhone 11 is superior for snapshots and much better in low-light. I typically don't need to do anything to get a decent image with the iPhone 11 yet surprisingly the Moto G Stylus 2021 has the ability to create better photos in daylight. The 4k video was also a big surprise, it's only 30fps, but the results are still excellent. I haven't had a single issue with the phone in nearly 6 months of use. There are limitations, Motorola not using any type of Gorilla Glass for the screen being on of the biggest, but considering how low the price is and everything included for the money I'm giving it 5 stars."
301,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,Sometimes it's decides it's going to do what it wants to do far as cutting off your keyboard and not letting you bring it back up until after you shut off the phone this was advertised as a new phone not a used one I bought a new phone and this is what happens it did hook up to the straight talk wireless fairly easy just took the SIM card out and put it in the phone and it worked until it come time to pay then it said that I had a phone that wasn't compatible so I paid the bill and it works the Motorola phone updates are insane I've had it update three times in one day by Motorola and then I went in there and shut it off where it could end update because that would take up all the memory on my phone if it updates three times a day didn't make no sense that is just dumb why not do it one time a month and do it all at one time instead of updating three times a day the battery life is excellent the fingerprint is on the screen button to turn the screen on it works really well and quick The stylist gets a little funky every once in awhile I don't like all the Google apps on here had problems trying to use some of the stuff off of my 32 GB memory card from my old phone things wouldn't pull up pictures and whatnot some of my music wouldn't pull up luckily I had a backup memory card tried it again with the new card same problem it wanted me to format the 128 GB card I don't know what for it still works like crap and I know it's not the card I never have a problem with SanDisk especially when the card cost me out arm and leg but it's worth it to save your pictures and your information cheat cards do not work in this phone but the sandisk works okay I put my own memory card back in my old phone and it still work fine I put it in my wife's phone and it worked fine I just don't understand why it wouldn't work in the new phone so I had to buy a new SanDisk transfer the pictures over as a copy just in case the phone tricked out and erase my pictures and my music and videos
302,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I've had this phone for about 8 months.  I wanted to use it for a while before writing a review.  It's my 1st unlocked phone and so far I'm pleased with it.  I use Verizon as my service provider.  My old Motorola Droid Maxx froze up after using it for over 5 years so had to replace. I'm one of those people who doesn't replace my phone every year I usually use it til either the software is no longer updated or it gives up the ghost.  In this case my droid maxx gave up the ghost.  I had already been considering replacing it but then the screen finally cracked and it froze up and nothing would unfreeze it not even the folks at Verizon could get it to work.I'm also a fan of Motorola phones so was looking to buy another Motorola phone.So I decided to try this Moto G Stylus 2021 based on the reviews and price that I found on Amazon.  So far I like most of the features and how it works.  However, there are a few things I don't like.  My old Motorola droid maxx used wireless charging which I loved as there was no need to replace the charging cable when it wore out or worry about the charge port going bad like with previous phones I've owned.The Moto G Stylus  does not have wireless charging which is one of two downsides, but so far the charging cable and charge port work fine so not a deal breaker.The 2nd downside is that the only way to cast from the phone to your tv is to use Chromecast.  I tried several cast apps from the Google store but none worked.  Miracast is not supported either.  I'm sure someone tech savvy and with enough HDMI and USB cables might find a way to cast to the tv without using Chromecast but I'm not that savvy and the Motorola website says to use Chromecast to cast with this phone, so I bit the bullet by taking the path of least resistance and spent $30 to buy Chromecast on Amazon.Also, when I received my phone I had a difficult time getting the sim card to activate the phone so I had to go to Verizon to have them figure it out. I spent over an hour at the store as they tried to activate my phone.  They finally figured out that because my old phone had frozen completely something happened that interfered with the new phone activation and the sim card. Anyway once they figured out what was going on they were able to get my new phone to work.  I'm sure most people won't have this issue if your old phone still works.I like the camera feature also as the picture is much better than the picture from my old phone.  In addition night time pictures or pictures taken in the dark turn out sharp and clear.  Definitely an improvement from the camera feature on my old phone.I also like the long battery life.  So far with normal use it will last about 2 days sometimes longer, but sometimes it only lasts about 24 hrs but I think it's due to certain apps or features that I use that use up more battery power vs just standard usage with using battery saver.So overall I'm happy with this phone.  It seems to be well synced with Google too, so it's easy to access anything on your Google account. It did take me a little bit to get used to it's features and functionality, but it does come with a Moto icon on my home screen that is a guide that's at your finger tips to help you figure out a function or feature.  After 8 months I'm still learning new stuff about this phone."
303,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I really like this phone. Don't let the title mislead you. It's a great phone, and powerful enough for what I need it to do. And I especially like I don't have to  have a contract with one of the carriers to use it. Contracts are a legal form of robbery, in my view. Everything about it is great, BUT don't let the 2 day battery in the title mislead you. If you barely use your phone, it might last 2 days. But I use mine throughout the day, and it barely makes it over one day without needing a charge. But we all have chargers handy, right? Great phone overall."
304,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I just received it today and it was new, in box as described and was truly unlocked! All I had to do was put my cricket sim card in and BAM! I was ready to go! Crisp screen, great photos and so far the battery has held on strong. Very satisfied with this phone and would definitely recommend!! Thanks!!"
305,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,Got this for my phone as an upgrade from her last moto g phone. Changing things from one phone to the other was easy. Over all screen brightness and 1080p screen is night. She does like the stylus and cameras aren't to bad as well.
306,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I was impressed right out of the box and having played with it now for 3 days I give it five stars! It's the same size as my s22 ultra and has a nice clear bright display, is responsive with smooth scrolling and awesome cameras! I love the feel of it and I'm enjoying not having 5G! It was very simple to get it added to my Verizon plan But whichever carrier you choose remember you're buying and unlocked phone so definitely go into to your settings for your phone connectivity and choose your carrier instead of automatic, it will be set to automatic when you get it. I'll add a picture to show you what I mean. Yes it will work on automatic but it will also glitch sometimes and try to connect to a stronger carrier in the area if you leave it on automatic. I seriously have zero cons all pros I love this phone I really do!It's a great phone at a great price!"
307,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,Good phone I like everything about it I am not sure how it happene but the pins in my phone's USB port got all bent. It stopped me from charging the phone easily I straightened them out a few fell out and it was hard to get charging.  It's not super easy to replace so I have to get a new phone. I would still recommend the phone just be careful how you put your charger in.
308,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,Great Little Programing MetroPCS
309,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"We bought one and loved it so we bought another. The stylus is convenient and the sound quality is great. Great for regular use, games and conducting business."
310,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I've had this phone for a while now. I use it for personal and work. I've never had an issue with anything. Solid product.Everything on the phone is very responsive. Even after using it for as long as I have, they stylus, finger print reader, etc. is still working like I just took it out of the package.I predict I'll still be using this phone for a few more years before I'll have a need to replace it.I care about the longevity of a product, this phone fills that need."
311,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"The physical size is a bit too large to fit comfortably in my pockets, which I was pretty sure was going to be the case, but I was sacrificing ease of pocketing for better internal storage (just couldn't find quite the perfect intersection of the two, for some reason).I have been pretty sad about the camera. I was really looking forward to that feature in particular, the specs sounded great! But in practice, the zoom is awful, the photos aren't sharp, it's very sad.But the phone works great, rarely crashes, apps run well."
312,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"Dislike fingerprint location on this model, other Motorola's have been a great value."
313,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I'm not a person whose going to spend $1K on a phone because everyone else is, and I am not getting locked into the Apple ecosystem ever again.  This phone, so far, has been a great upgrade to replace my Galaxy S8+ that though functioning perfectly well, is no longer receiving security updates.It's a shame that security updates aren't taken more seriously by these hardware providers, and I wish Google would just take them out of the hands of the hardware companies entirely, make it a baseline OS issue and keep them coming through the Play Store as long as the OS version is still valid.  Unfortunately, that's not where we're at, so we're being forced into a ""buy new at least every 2"" paradigm.This phone, while a little large for my liking (my hands are on the small side), is usable one-handed.  The stylus is not particularly my cup of tea, but it was worth the experiment.  Handwriting on a screen of this size isn't particularly useful in my mind (at least not yet) and really requires a larger screen and more intelligent stylus.The phone is overall snappy and responsive, though I admit I don't use my phone as a computer -- I use it as a communications device, so my usage patterns shouldn't really be stressing the speed and overall performance.While some people do seem to have issues with swapping a Verizon SIM from one phone to another, I had no issues doing so between my old phone and this unit.The camera(s) seem to be quite good, and I've paired this up with a DJI OM5 gimbal already, though I did have to remove the Motorola case from it to get the magnetic holder to keep a secure grip on the phone.I wasn't so sure about the fingerprint reader being in the power button, but so far it has worked like a champ with no failures I've recalled.Overall, another good phone from Moto."
314,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,Arrived quickly which got me out of a mess.  Fairly easy to navigate.  Not sure about the fingerprint recognition feature - seems a bit hard to use when the phone is in a case.  Nice Display.  General impression is that this will be a good phone for me.
315,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"arrived on time from seller.  the phone is nice. fingerprint reader has several fingerprint settings so you can use mulitple digits. my only qualm is that the fingerprint reader is on the side so everytime you grab your phone you run the risk of closing the screen, opening the screen or something else happening. Had to train myself to stop setting off the fingerprint reader. It was annoying, still kinda is a few months later.  the phone works well. fast for what i need. coming from a lg phone that i loved, the moto is an adjustment but it is okay"
316,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,I'm on the AT&T prepaid plan.  Just remove sim card from old phone and place in this one.  My favorite features on this phone is the 4000mah battery and the stylus.
317,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,I bought for the stylus & seldom use it. The one ear speaker is a little disappointing. I switch to speaker phone when possible. The O/S even with the upgrade is a bit sluggish. I have it set to enlarge text but sometimes it stays large which defeats the purpose. For ease of operation I should have spent a few dollars more
318,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I bought this almost a year ago, after having the 2020 Stylus that I really loved. My dad was needing a new phone, and I wanted to ""upgrade,"" so I got the 2021 and gave him 2020. Comparatively and reading, I instantly noticed the sound quality on 2021 was a lot worse, and it was noted by several online reviewers.  After having it for a  few months, it started getting really hot anytime I charged it or had a game open. I went on moto support, who insisted I was just doing too much, even if it was one app. It would overheat and turn off my cellular service. It was only on occasion, and I attributed it to the game. Now, after a year, the battery I can watch drops for every minute I am on the phone, it drops about a percent. I had to factory rest as a final resort as all the moto systems say the battery is fine and says that my regular use is suddenly ""irregular use"", and I am using it more than often than usual, which I wasn't.  After the reset, it's still getting hot, and the battery is better but only slightly. Paid the $25 for the extra year of warranty because I don't think it will last another 3 months.  2020 my dad is using is still going strong no heat issues and the battery lasts all day!"
319,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"This is running the (currently) newest android 11 OS and apparently NO ONE likes it. My Amazon Music App hates it, My power amp app hates it and it absolutely refuses to work with the wifi at my work. I suspect the os has been modified to ""protect"" the user more which would be nice except, as with ALL things google they thing they know better than the user what the user wants or needs. and there is really no way to personalize or disable these things to make it user friendly. The battery frequently overestimates how much longer it will last but I can work around that."
320,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,VERY NICE LIKE OVER PRICED APPL CELLS FOR A VERY LOW PRICE
321,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I waited a couple (3 i think) before writing a review, because the last phone i got (google pixel 3) i did the review and then the issues atarted happening. This phone is great. The battery could probably last a couple of days, if your not on it at all. At first the phone would every once in a while glitch out. I did all the updates, and the gliches stopped happening. Now for games it does overheat slightly, like the phone would be a tad warm, but nothing that seemed harmful to the phone. I did the face recognition, because for me the fingerprint didnt work. No problem. I love the storage space on it, i have all my music on it and it doesnt even budge. The camera quality is eh, but i dont really care too much about that. I would buy this phone if your thinking about itğŸ˜ğŸ˜"
322,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I had this product for a week or two to see how I liked it and I felt it wasn't right for me. The phone looks really nice and has lots of features but there are alot of really bad design elements that I felt were not worth it. The notch/hole punch I really dislike and has become an awful trend these days along with the rounded display which added to the inconvenience as I found myself constantly having to move my hands away from the screen because it would unintentionally touch the screen due to the screen size being so huge and not having any cutoff. The speaker and earphone plug being at the bottom was a really bad design choice and I found it very awkward and annoying orienting the phone sideways without blocking the speaker, this was a feature that was not broken so I don't know why it was altered. The phone claims it comes with 128 gigs of memory but in reality it will come with 114 gigs free as the rest is used up by apps and there is a ton of them which I don't understand why.The particular phone that I had seemed to have some sort of battery issues and I couldn't figure out if it was something to do with rogue apps draining the battery or the screen or both. The battery wouldn't even last a day even though it advertises two days of battery, on standby it would last but not in usage. Most of the time I had to have the phone on battery saver and dim the backlight completely and it still would not last the whole day. I figure maybe the specific one I got was defective. If you are willing to look past all the annoying design elements then this is a nice phone. I prefer phones that are simple to use, have lots of memory, are fast and have long battery life. Unfortunately, this phone checked none of those boxes for me."
323,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I decided to switch to the Moto G Stylus (2020 ed.) last year b/c I became very irritated w/ Samsung's and Apple's exhortation. I cannot reasonably justify buying a Â«premiumÂ» phone that costs well over 1K. You can get an ipad now for less than two hundred bucks and now these companies are wanting 1000+ for a phone that doesn't do that much more.My computer, which I work more on does a lot more, cost less than half of this price. So jumping was more a philosophical change.Based off my experience with this phone I can tell you the following:1- The phone has a modest performance and works well comparing the price cost of the newest other flagship phones.2- The phone does 95% of what other so-called premium phones do w 1/3 of the price3- The phone charge is insane. I have held one charge for at least three day and spend several hours on the.4- The camera is outstanding for the brand and takes some nice sunny shots (will add photos later).5- The stylus pen, although simple, really under-sales itself and does a lot for the price of this.6- I hardly noticed too much performance distinctions with these phone and other more popular phones. Now granted, I am not trying to play hard-core video games because that's what a gamer-PC is supposed to do (pun intended), but still compared to the prices of others, I don't think you can beat this model."
324,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"Replaced my 3g that was old and had no frills. I don't like how intrusive these new phones are. Too much Google. But everything works and it has good sound, calls and texts work. T-mobile set it up with a nano sim and no charge. Very nice about throwing me off 3g. No, really were nice."
325,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,The phone works just fine but sometimes after charging I find that by the evening I need to charge again. It's even died on me.  It definitely does not have a 2 day battery
326,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"It's so BIG! I mean, it's the same width as my previous Motorola, but longer, thus it doesn't fit into my wallet case, barely fits in pockets, and has a fair weight to it.Outside of that, the screen is beautiful. Gaming is enhanced, it's very easy to assign individual ring tones and text tones (provided you can find an ad-free app), the fingerprint security is easy to use thus preventing prying eyes from reading your texts.Activating the camera is easier with one-touch instead of confirming which related app to open. Flashlight activation with a shake of the hand, camera activation with either a twist of the wrist or a screen touch, the use of a stylus when needed, OH!, and the ability to screenshot easily during an action game on FEH.Memory size is awesome, able to accommodate all the updates and still perform when I ask it to. You know, things like being able to answer a call when it comes in?I'm still sorting through many features of my new phone."
327,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I initially bought a Moto G Stylus 2021, but the screen was dim and yellow at the bottom. I returned it for another Moto G Stylus and it had the exact same problem. So I returned that second phone and got the Moto G Power and it's been great.I've been using Motorola phones for a while and I buy the phones for our family plan. So this is probably the tenth Motorola I've bought over the years. I'm coming from a Moto One, and so far I like this phone.Here are my highs and lows with the Moto G Power so far:HIGHSNice, large screen. This is a fairly big phone.Expandable memory -- I bought a 128GB MicroSD that worked great.The navigation and movement is very smooth.Moto Gestures: I've always loved ""twist"" to open camera and ""chop"" for flashlight. Very useful!Nice pictures -- the quality is plenty good enough for me.Very large battery. Keeps a long charge.Water resistance.Side-mounted fingerprint sensor works well.Comes with a quality wall charger and cable.I love that Motorola doesn't load the phone down with a bunch of preloaded apps like Samsung does.LOWSThis phone might be too big for some people with smaller hands.Slick, plastic body. You'll probably want a case. (I love the Rugged Shield cases.)Android 10 Gesture Navigation. If you don't like swiping all the time, you can turn the old three-button navigation on in Settings.Overall, I'm still a happy Motorola customer. I will update this review should I encounter any problems."
328,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I, too, had the issue of not receiving text messages and was super bummed because I really liked the upgrade from the G7 Play to this G stylus. BUT after clearing the cache on messages app, then restarting, everything came through!I use straight talk, and when speaking to an agent was told this phone is not compatible. I had researched before buying and knew he was probably incorrect, so I used the straight talk app to get the phone working and success!Giving 4 stars due to the texting issue, all my research points to it being a phone issue. Hope this helps!"
329,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"Haven't really used face recognition function. Fingerprint reader works great. However, the power button doubles as the fingerprint reader and it takes some getting used to having the fingerprint reader on the side. It is recessed so buying a functional case is more challenging since you have to make certain you can scan the active finger(s) with the phone in the case. I use the thumbprint and found a nice, inexpensive holster/protective case. I made a minor modification so I can insert/remove the Sim/SD card tray and now I'm all set. Be careful when ordering a case. There are different model years of this phone with stylus and the phones are somehow different between years. The 2021 phone does not fit in the 2020 case. The battery life is very good. I use this phone for downloading and watching videos. I love the bigger screen and how easy it is to find the function buttons. Though the phone dimensions are a bit bigger than previous phones I've owned, I enjoy this one most. It seems just large enough to be useful for many tablet functions without being too large to be just a phone."

Â It works with my at@t I was scared that it wasn't going to work I'm so happy it dose I got these phone because I broke my other phone this was is really good love it"
331,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I needed a decent relatively large screen cell phone and this perfectly fit the bill. And best of all I got it for less than $250. Only problem was when he t updated to android 11 I wasn't getting messages via WhatsApp neither could I access the camera or photos. Apparently the location to Whatsapp files had no ot been updated but with google research I had to change the name of the Whatsapp folders and not it works perfectly. It does just what I want, holds charge well, takes decent photos so I'm happy! I rarely use the stylus but I still find it quite responsive... Happy I purchased it.. just a pity it won't upgrade beyond Android 11 but hopefully Motorola will change that. Needless to say it's a decent mid priced device!"
332,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"My wife got this phone based on the YouTube reviews. So far, the phone has performed flawlessly and was impressed by it. My wife's aging Samsung Galaxy phone is still working fine, but the appearance of the phone is starting to degrade. The camera performed well enough to give it 4 starts! The battery life is good but not entire 2 days, I'll say more like 1.5 day which is not bad for 6.8"" screen. Overall, there's no lag on the performance, and everything seemed to be working as advertised. The stylus pen works pretty good and is fun to write down notes and sketch some artwork. There are several hidden features on the phone which are very useful. The Moto app is very nice as well!!! You can learn all these hidden features on YouTube. If anyone is on budget and doesn't want to spend hundreds of hard-earned money, this phone is for you. I can't justify for spending hundreds or even a thousand for something that will obsolete in just few years??!! This Moto phone doesn't look cheap, feels cheap, and it is a solid phone. The entire phone is made out of plastic but who cares! The phone will be covered with a hard case anyway! No problem receiving calls and texting if your carrier is T-Mobile.We were little disappointed when the phone was delivered. The phone got delivered in a plastic bag (no packing materials unprotected). Once we opened the bag we noticed the factory seal on the box was missing. Someone has already opened the box previously (finger prints) or returned the item. We were not happy!!! Called the Amazon and explained the situation, Amazon gave us $50 discount with 30 days return policy. We are okay with that. Amazon needs to step it up and monitor these issues!!!"
333,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,I bought these phones for emergency and I had to keep it but I like it for the headphones jack. Motorola not going to update it to Android 12. I don't use the stylus pen. By the way it's a good phone if you are on a budget.
334,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,I've had Samsung phones for years. I tried Moto Stylus because I didn't want to spend a lot on another phone. This phone does not disappoint. I love it. Highly recommend.
335,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"This is a great upgrade from my Lg Stylus 4, glad I got it."
336,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"Being somewhat technologically challenged at my age, I learn new gadgets rather slowly. Still don't know how to do many things on my new phone. Grandkids help me some, but they all have I-phones, so cannot always help me."
337,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"It is certainly a nice upgrade from my Moto e4 Plus.  Not half bad for around $200.  It does what I need it to do and I'm finding nice little surprises by using it more.  I don't really play games on my phone, so I can't speak to that aspect of it.  The only downside I'm having with it is that there is no notification dot, so you cannot tell if you have missed any calls or texts without physically interacting with the phone.  Sure, there are apps for making your phone flash, but most of those either don't work at all or don't work like I want/need them to.  Overall though, not a bad phone thus far."
338,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I've had this phone for about four months now and I'm very happy with it. The storage is good although I don't have hundreds of pictures on it. The phone is very clear, the pictures are good and it's very user friendly. I've used the stylus on occasions and it works well. I'm sure there are many other features that I haven't even used yet. I like that you can ask the Moto assistant questions and the answers pop up rather quickly. It's also helpful when you don't have time to type something in."
339,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I had 3 old phones go bad on me in the last 6 months, and needed a new, affordable one. I've liked my Moto phones, and this had decent specs, so I went for it. I've had it for a week now. I'm loving the size and quality of the display. It's a little hard to use one handed, but the extra screen real estate is awesome. It's great when the keyboard is on the screen....much more room above it.I haven't used the camera a lot yet, but I took some really lovely sunset pictures and some macro shots (that was another selling point for me....I wanted to take pictures of small details in things I collect). The camera seems a LOT better than my past Motos. And the software has some fun options. And I've always loved the Moto twist to open the camera/chop to open flashlight gestures.I'm really happy that it came with 128GB of storage, and REALLY love that there's a microSD slot so I could just pop in my old card with tons of pictures/music/videos on it already. And it's great having the USB-C connection instead of the micro USB on my old dead phones.The stylus is just okay....nothing like the Wacom tech on my Samsung tablet. But it's kinda fun to color, etc. And better than a finger for photo editing, etc.The fingerprint reader has been working great. Seems much better than the one on my beloved dead Galaxy S7 Edge.I may edit this later to add things, but wanted to mention to another reviewer how to get the 3-button navigation he's used to. I did it myself when I got the phone, because I wanted the buttons, not the gestures. Go to Settings - System - Gestures - System Navigation and then choose 3 Button Navigation. Voila!"
340,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,Se sienten bien con lo que les comprÃ© son buenos
341,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I really love this phone. I needed a new phone because my 32 g was ran out of space. I got this for 128 g huge difference plus it's smooth, faster and the battery last a good long time. I was use to the back button, couldn't figure out how to get off a page. You swipe left to go back, just need to get use to it. I haven't use the stylus yet, I've only had the phone a few days. The only issue I had was, I wasn't receiving text messages until I call tech support. It was a little bit of a process but they took time to walk me through it and I do receive text now. If you have this problem and no doubt you will, don't go to the store, my Verizon store was absolutely no help. Call tech support, you'll be back in business in no time."
342,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,I love everything about this phone. I have always been an LG person. But I like this phone alot.
343,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I have been using this phone for a week. For now, everything works great and I think it's great for its price. Only problem is with battery. It is not two day battery as it advertised. You should expect one full charge a day if your phone using time is average or a bit more than average. Also, you should expect huge phone that is quit uncomfortable in your pocket and not one hand friendly. But still it is not really disappointing, and it is great value for its price."
344,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,I just got this phone and I am very impressed and happy with this purchase. The only thing I can say it could use is 5G  it has 4G but it hasn't changed my mind. I would definitely buy this phone again.
345,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"Moto G Stylus 2021 -  Easy to operate. Speaker volume is not loud enough (just ok) because per specification has only 1 speaker.  Some other Moto models have 2 speakers. Camera is good and clear EXCEPT color you see is not what the color you get!.  And it seems the camera is constantly auto adjusting color every millisecond.  Should have a manual adjustment for color temperature, hue, saturation, tint, color balance etc to get the right color.  When I point camera to the wall with dark beige color, camera screen shows light beige !  Another wall with brownish orange shows on camera screen as just brown !  How can Moto engineers get this wrong even with 3 lenses ???  Stylus seems good and did not feel the ""trailing"" effect as some mentioned (there was some millisecond delay though; tolerable). Can write on screen without turning on the phone which is a good feature when my wife blurt out grocery list. Also good when need to write address or other info others tell you during conversation.  Overall good value for money.  I paid $299.  $250 would have been best."
346,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,This is not  48 MP. Camera I can not get no more than 12MP. But the sound is very good and loud. Phone runs fast except for start up. I like Motorola phones. Has audio effects so you can listen in 3DğŸ˜ƒğŸ˜‡
347,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"Overall, I really this phone. The finger print scanner on the power button is really nice. I don't need to type the number in every time to unlock. My only complaint is the size. It's about twice the size as my old phone. I wish it was a little smaller to better fit in my pocket. It's borderline the size of a small tablet and is almost too big. That's why I removed 1 star."
348,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"This phone is simply good. Not expensive and, as a result, light in the ""bells and whistles"" department but if you're like me that doesn't matter very much. There are a few things that annoy me sometimes that I don't feel like going into very much so I'll just list a few: some apps that have swipe features can be tricky with the swipe to go back or go to home feature, I wish it had dual sided speakers, sometimes I accidently trigger the fingerprint scanner and turn it on while I am putting it in my pocket, it's a little larger than I realized."
349,Motorola,Moto G stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,First I love the look of this phone. It's an amazing smartphone.I received it on Saturday. It was packaged very well in it's original Moto Box.Everything that was advertised was included inside the box.It does not include a SIM card.You will have to purchase your own.It is an Unlocked Phone. Very easy to set up with AT&T. it was easy to port with my old LG cellphone.Contacts. Emails and Apps.Grateful...So you add your own personal touches wallpaper and fronts.If you are considering purchasing it Moto G Stylus please don't be afraid.It's beautiful...It's Big...It's A Very Nice Smartphone...Thank you Amazon I really like my new phone...Monday after monitoring my device. Because Am honest my phone has a defective battery. It only stay charges may 2/3 hours.I won't sent it back my phone is my life. I love the design and bigness of it..Am sure not all of them are this way...I just happen to get one.Beautiful phone...but there is most definitely a battery problem...The Battery Does Not Stay Charged Very Long.That was my whole purpose of buying...The fact that it suppose to stay charge for two days...Not 2 hours...Real........
350,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"Edit: knocked it down a star. After using the phone for 4 months, unlocking it is often inconsistent. My thumb fingerprint takes a few tries or isn't recognized at all. I added another fingerprint, added face unlock, added to keep it unlocked at home, and with all that unlocking is passable. I'd still probably get this phone again, but the unlocking issue is annoying. Battery life is still great though, most of the time I get two days.Original review: I went from a 2019 flagship, the LG G8 to this phone. In theory, I shouldn't have. This has mid-range specs and I lost out downgrading from a flagship, even if it is 3 years old. However, I think phones are now as exciting as toothbrushes. They are pretty much just there to do a job, and if they do the job, then who cares? I can only notice the slightest occasional difference in day-to-day performance with this phone from the LG. The camera is slightly worse in low light. But it is pretty much the same. The screen on this phone is great, and I'm glad it's a 90hz screen, but I honestly can't tell the difference from 60hz. The stylus is fun occasionally, and it's nice to have OS and security updates, at least for a while. The battery life and large screen are the main reasons I got this phone. The battery will last for a couple days with light use, and one full day with heavy use. That's what I'm looking for. Overall, very happy with the purchase."
351,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I honestly REALLY like this device. It's new, unlocked, has expandable memory up to 1TB, nice display, and the stylus I really wanted. The only issue is I wish cameras were a little better, but WHAT A DEAL even with that said. Most importantly, I own this phone, so I'm not held captive by any carrier contract!"
352,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"This is not our first Motorola phone. I've been using Motorola for quite a few years. I bought this one for my wife. She loves it. It runs smoothly with 6 Gig of ram, and has a beautiful display. It has great battery life and does everything she wants. Motorola gives you the best bang for your buck. Aside from a few Moto apps there's no bloatware. If you're like us, and don't care about 5g at this point, I recommend this phone."
353,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"Don't believe the tripe the reviewer was blathering on about the battery. Sure you might get a lemon now and again, but twice in a row? Doubtful. Also, it does not automatically download tik tock. They had to have done it while in YouTube.I started out with android phones and moved to Apple about eight or so years ago. I think back then security updates were a new thing for Android and it was impossible to get a security update for LG phones.So I switched over.I'm happy with the Apple phones, but after all these years I was wondering what android was like these days. Not wanting to spend a lot of money to find out and get as clean an android as possible ( minimal bloat ware) I did some research and picked this Moto G Stylus.This is about as clean an android you're going to get. Aside from a few Moto apps ( note taker and user guide) there's no bloatware. You'll have to do the usual privacy setting adjustments in Google to your liking, otherwise, I've been really liking this phone. The bigger screen is nice for reading. Reviews were gripeing about processor performance but this phone has been pretty quick. To me a phone is a tool not a toy, so I can't mention anything about playing games.The way android works with Google calendar and notifications is much nicer than the way Apple does it. Most common functions are built into iOS and here they are apps but everything has been working fine.The battery has been excellent. My use is; phone calls, texting, internet use, you tube, Kindle and Amazon music. If I took it off the charger Monday morning at 9am, I'll easily have 30+ percent left on Tuesday night. Sometimes more with light usage.I haven't gone back to the Apple phone and been enjoying discovering the available apps and how android works.If you're looking for a good budget phone, I'd pick this over the budget Samsungs. They have too much bloatware."
354,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"The phone is overall great for the price. Decent camera, memory, loads apps quickly, pretty much all the things you want your phone to do, it does, and does well. What is the super annoying issue? This phone has gotten rid of the little arrow in the lower left of the screen for going ""back"". Instead, you swipe from either the left or right edge of the screen to go back. And it's WAY too sensitive. Pretty much any time I try to just scroll left or right it interprets it as a ""back"" command unless I make extra sure to swipe from the dead center of the screen. So, if you were reading an article, you'll now have to start over. There's also no more little circle button at the bottom center of the screen to go back to the home screen either. You swipe up from the very bottom of the screen to do that. That actually works fine. You really have to be at the very bottom to make it go to the home screen."
355,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I'm a loyal fan of Motorola. This stylus is the latest upgrade. We are poor folks, so we won't get the one that came out this year until next. We love it. Battery last forever until I remember to put it on the charger. Screen is bigger and I love the stylus. Just can't forget to keep up with it."
356,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"For a $200 phone, it competes against those in the 4-600 range.  It has a real headphone/mic jack and a built in FM radio tuner but can do all the bluetooth stuff. A surprisingly awsome camera for the money!  A surprisingly good screen for the money! And surprisingly good ram and storage for the money!  The processor is also surprisingly good for the money. All in all, it is probably about the best budget class high tech phone you can get... at least it was when I researched and purchased. Got one for me and one for the kid and strongly thinking about getting another just in case spare.Update after two months of use:The only actual real negative I can attribute to this model is that there are no aftermarket camera lens protector covers that are designed in a way that they don't fall off way too easily! Why can't a lens cover be made so it's held on by the phone case fitting over it? Other than that... Android 11 is not necessarily better than 10. But that isn't about the phone so much as the OS. I still believe it is a better phone than most. Especially if you want a none 5G one. Or live where there is no 5G. So far as I know. The only other ones that offer the same or better features cost  at least $200 more and are 5G"
357,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,Compared to my old Motorola this phone is awesome! Camera is great and it's fast and smooth with plenty of storage. Battery life is not 2 days but still good. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
358,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"Battery life 5 days. Im just a regular phone user (calls, texts, emails) - not heavy on downloads no uploads. light to medium use of media (watching videos, no games). 30% battery used in zoom hosting for 2 1/2 hours. It takes 2 1/2 to 3 hrs to get fully charged from 15% of battery charged.Good deal for the money. Facial recognition i gave three stars -i dont kniow,  had never used. I'm not into that yet. There are lot features but i only used that suit my needs. i still have a lot to explore. So far i just stick to what i need."

360,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,Good overall use phone but can't use the SD card has internal storage and battery life is lasting about a day and a half when my Moto g power would make it 3 days
361,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,Me encanta â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸ muy hermosas fotos
362,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,This phone is awesome easy to use and the 1080p 90hz I'm very impressed. Awesome phone.
363,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I had the 2020 version of this phone and REALLY liked it. Sadly after two years the battery over expanded and cracked the case. So I intended to buy another one of the same but inadvertently got the newest iteration, which is about an inch too long for my pockets. Other than the carrying issue...it's fine; battery is good, reception is great.....charging is noticeably longer for some reason."
364,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,Good phone
365,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"It's a phone, everything works, a little larger than my last one which only had to be replaced because it didn't even have 4G! And it was allegedly 2021!!  The battery life on this brand new phone is the worst I have ever had!!!!!!!"
366,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I bought this phone to upgrade from my unlocked moto g7 that was getting slower as I rely more and more on my phone for email, texting, work phone app, booking flights, and light game use (think Words with Friends). I'm not a user that requires ""the best."" I just wanted to upgrade my Android OS to 11, add some RAM, and get a refreshed processor. This phone fits the requirements. I like the increased performance I'm seeing. The battery lasts me about 24 hours before hitting 15%. Fingerprint unlock is fine with the power button acting as the reader instead of a circular reader on the back of the phone. My pictures and video appear to be sharper than that I was able to get out of my g7, but of course not what you'd find in a high end phone. This is my first phone with a facial recognition unlock and that also seems to work just fine for me. The stylus is an unexpected pro. I like having one permanently onboard as it helps me navigate my email and calendars much more easily than my thumbs ever did. Any cons are just around me adjusting to the slightly new interface. The ""back"" icon I'm so used to is now a back swipe from the right side of the screen. The zoom feature on the camera requires a little more finesse than my fat fingers like, but I'm learning how to use it. Overall, it's a solid 4G LTE phone for those of us who like an unlocked phone that can work with GSM or CDMA carriers. If the phone lasts for three years as my g7 did, I would consider this a five star phone."
367,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I purchased this phone on second prime day this past October.  I didn't like the tall size and slim design, it felt a bit slow, I was expecting more.  Yes it did have 2 mor GB of RAM, but that didn't really do much for me.  The real disappointment was it still had Android 11...I mean WHAT THE HELL...Really...My two year old version of the same phone has Android 11...The price was descent, but I was paying for a newer version, which I felt delivered less.Still love Motorola, but would of wanted a Snapdragon  and Adreno to go alone with those 6gigs, and for sure Android 12.  Also my 2020 version had Dou speaker, this speaker on the new 2022 has one speaker."
368,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,Love this phone ! Plenty of internal storage with 128gb plus up to 512gb micro SD card! 6 gb ram for smooth operation. 16mb quad pixel rear camera for a combined 50mp takes unbelievably clear sharp brilliant pictures ! The FHD camera is nice but 4k would have been better. Only thing I don't like is apps can not be stored on the SD card but 128gb internal is more than enough for what I need for app storage. Does not come with a good dedicated gallery app but there are good gallery apps in the Google Play store free and purchase. Comes with Android 11 which allowed me to upgrade a lot of my apps and I believe this phone will get 1 Android upgrade to Android 12 in the near future with 2 years of security updates. 6.8 FHD screen shows clear sharp colorful movies. I've seen reviews where some though the phone was too long but I think it's great. Glad I purchased this phone. It's my 1st Motorola...Hello Moto !!
369,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"The phone does exactly what I need it to do. However, the battery life is horrible. I received my phone on 08/08/22 and have had to charge it 3 times so far. As it finished charging, I've watched my battery go from 100% to 86% in less than 10 minutes. Outside of that, I have no complaints. Any chances of getting a new battery??"
370,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"My Moto G Stylus is blazing fast compared to my Android Pixel 2. Battery life for the Moto Stylus G is good for more than 2 days after a full charge.Camera says it is 50mp, but in reality is not as good as my old Pixel 2 (a 12mp camera).Overall, it is good phone for the money. Calls are clear and sound quality is very good. Screen is sharp and easy to read."
371,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,Brand new and over a $150 cheaper and unlocked
372,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,I like this phone.
373,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"Initially I was impressed with the motor g stylus 2022 (non 5g).  Despite being plastic housing the look and feel of the device was on the higher end.  The battery life was good and it has a nice large display. I went from a 3 year old premium smartphone to the moto stylus.  The stylus and its processor are quick...but not fast. You can tell you are working with a value phone if you have used a premium one in the past. And my 3 year plus old phone speed tested much better than the stylus. That being said I found it to be a great value overall. The reason I ended up returning it was due to ongoing issues with getting pictures, videos, and attachments in messages.  They were blurry and low quality. If not for this I would have kept the device and enjoyed it as a low cost alternative."
374,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"Love this phone, we will be buying another 1 for my wife. So we both will own a Moto G stylus..!!!"

376,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,I'm still testing. The speaker keeps downloading the audio. Sometimes you don't listen. The camera is not 50 as described. I would like the seller's explanation

379,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"Overall great phone. Has some quirks, but works as a travel/backup phone. Good battery life!"
380,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I bought the unit and returned it unopened. Never had a chance to test the unit. I returned it, cause I wanted the 5G version. Cellular companies are having out 3G and eventually 4G.... It only makes logical sense to get one that has 5G. If you ask my personal opinion, I think 5G is a way to get customers to upgrade their phones. You will never get the speeds they say 5G downloads speeds. Considering it's wireless..."
381,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,Overall a decent phone but the battery life is disappointing.
382,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"2.5 stars. I had the galaxy S8 for years and replaced it with this phone.  I hated the galaxy, and I really wanted to like this phone.  I do like it, but it is glitchy.  First off, the good.  The battery is awesome.  I sometimes will get a full two days from a charge and that is with fairly heavy use.  I listen to pod casts pretty much all day while working.  The camera is very good.  I love the big screen.  Volume is better than the galaxy.  There are other features that I also like, a few not as good as the galaxy, but no big deal on those.  The price was a major plus as well.  The two major things that really bug me about this phone is that is can be glitchy - sometimes it will freeze for a few seconds, or just randomly close apps... Things like that.  The ONE major showstopper though is that it often loses wifi and data connection.  It will sometimes randomly disconnect from my home wifi and cannot reconnect when others around me are on with no problems.  Sometimes I will have no phone service when others do who are on my same Verizon family plan.  Sometimes I will be places that I never had a problem with service before and will have no service.  *Sometimes* restarting the phone will temporarily fix the issue, but it doesn't last.  I run businesses so this isn't acceptable.  At this point I am considering other options.  Disappointed."
383,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"It is a fairly basic smartphone with a stylus. It is missing 5G capability, and NFC, but to me, that is not a real dealbreaker since the device's performance is fairly quick midrange phone, but do not expect a Galaxy Note 20 slayer.One thing that you need to be aware of  is the fact that USB Debugging is on by default. This is set this way deliberately for  the Lenovo Support app. Personally, I would recommend going into settings, activating developer mode, and shut it off unless you need it."
384,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,ğŸ‘ğŸ˜Š nice cellphone
385,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"This phone is amazing! It restored my faith in Motorola (had 2 so-so phone experiences with them prior) and the new OS is simply the best. It's so good that I'm coming back to Android for life! The best part was that I took the SIM card out of my broken camera iPhone, put it in this phone, and had immediate service from Mint mobile. Motorola, Mint, and Android for the WIN."
386,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"This is a solid phone, good build, reliable. The interface is a little slow, not a fast chip, and the touch screen response is laggy or fails to respond to the first touch. Does what I need it to do."
387,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"Ok. The battery life is not two days.  Also, I am constantly battling to keep it on WiFi.  It truly sucked to see it not two weeks after my purchase be fifty dollars cheaper.  I truly feel jipped."
388,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"In the past I managed cellular phones for corporations for over 10 years. I did a lot of research on the 2022 ""best phones"" and with spoke to others (3) who owned the Moto Stylus 2021 and 2022. I have to say after purchasing it, I am very impressed at how intuitive the phone is and how easy it is to learn. Well worth going with the 2022. Features that I looked for specifically from experience were: Removable SD card (wait until your built in one fails and learn), Camera Quality, Battery life, Streaming speed and video speed (the processor's ability to handle a load), control over carrier. Comparatively, you will not get a better phone for the money. The tiny differences in the higher end Moto, Samsung and Apple are not anywhere near worth the extra $$$."
389,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"Phone is OK for a fill in till you can get something else. Laggy for heavy users. Buggy Moto software. Battery life is no where near 3 days or 2 or 1 whole! Construction is pretty good tho, I've already dropped it several times. Pro, it's got a headphone jack."
390,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"After having it for a couple of weeks, it begins freezing in different apps. The camera makes my skin look yellow. It's not true to color. Not to mention, it does not have an NFC reader."
391,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,Got the 2020 Stylus... Awesome phone for 229.00. Saw this 2022 on sale for 199.00. More battery ... more ram... more screen. Love them both...
392,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"Ordered this Moto G Stylus 2022 in both the blue and the pink. They both showed up with half charged batteries. No worries, right? Just a quick charge to get the batteries to full and then start porting SIM card # info.Welp.The blue Moto took about an hour to get to full. The pink took over 5 hours. And never got to more than 92%. Yikes.So, I'll admit, I am an iPhone snob. These were intended for my two pre-teen children. Apparently Motorola must've known that b/c they decided the phones had to have Tictok, Facebook, and a bunch of other garbage apps upon initial activation. No biggee, right?Welp.So, we're coming from a Mint Mobile family plan. You must activate the SIM cards using the Mint mobile app; there is not other way to activate the phone. So I turn off the auto-download of all the garbage apps so I can get the Mint mobile app to do the single thing I care about doing. Nope. Immediately after cancelling the auto-download app downloads, they would immediately recommence downloading the garbage apps. Unreal. Is this a universal Android thing, or did I just have too high expectations for cheapo entry-level Android devices. So now I can't get the single app I need to make this phone an actual phone until all the other garbage downloads. Sheeesh.Sent them both back. Had to spend 2-3x more to get my kids into low-end iPhones, but at least I won't have to concern myself with bricked batteries and Tictok overriding my druthers on my children's phones.There were a number of other shortcomings as well, but not worth any more of my time in telling all of you that you should prob stay away from these devices if time, patience, value, and frictionless phone experiences are something you are seeking."
393,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,phone works great and 3 days inbetween charges
394,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"This is my 6th moto, just being the phone is good it has the latest update which is rare for moto. Screen looks nice, I'm a very heavy phone user. The battery barely lasts the day... No fast charge QC3 ...."
395,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I like the phone.  It's very user friendly, but the video quility is very bad.  It records glitchy.  Not a smooth sound"
396,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,screen is dull in color. the only way to see ANYthing is to have it on highest brightness. my last moto phone could be on lowest and still see screen. has a green dull tint like the cheap LG phone I once had. It honestly looks almost identical to the free junk Blu View 3 I got from lifeline company.It is not charging. It has gone 3% points in an hour. And that is the entire reason I was replacing my old moto is the battery was messed up after many years.The display being dark and dull and bad is a deal breaker. OH also huge noticable finger smudges on the screen which make it even more dull. I think Motorola has gone downhill.being most of their phones are now plastic.. and my son and his wife had 3 phones screens break back to back.*no visual voicemial. says is disabled.*almost NO sound on phone calls. wtf
397,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,Motorola offers a refreshing approach to an Android phone.  No bloatware.
398,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,I don't understand the bad reviews of this phone. I've had the phone for five days and have charged it twice. It went three days on its initial charge. I'm not a gamer nor do I watch many videos on the phone which I imagine would use more battery. Overall I'm very pleased with the phone. It's a big step up from the Honor 8 it replaced.
399,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"Nice solid all around Moto phone; big sharp screen, 6 GB RAM, good responsive fingerprint sensor on the power button; my only complaint is the battery seems to run down a bit faster than it should for such a big one. Nothing I can't live with, though. Haven't tried facial recognition yet and probably won't so can't say. So far sound is good and calls go through fine. Great new mid-level Motorola entry. Very pleased.."
400,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"The phone I received was by all estimations brand new. Not a mark on it and fully charged. However, being new to the Apple World, I can honestly say Windows & Android are both in plain, simple, super easy to understand English. Apple is not. Even its keyboard is not a full Standard Keyboard, like it is with Windows & any Google machine. Android is Google, that's why I say it that way. No getting around it. Just keeping it short & to the point. Apple's iPhone keyboard takes extreme amount of effort to use because it is not the Standard keyboard of every other operating system. Thankfully, I was able to connect a Bluetooth keyboard to it. Otherwise, it's a serious no-go for keyboard use.As for Apple's iPhone Touchscreen, again, I find it sorely lacking. There's no such thing as the simple pinch & zoom on it. That particular luxury seems to be found only within the Camera & Picture sections. You'd think it'd at least be within the iBook section but it's not. On most everything Windows or Google, every app is not just touch & activate, but also affords the luxury of pinch & zoom as well as easy swipe & easy app close & dismiss. Can't say that about the Apple iPhone.And for some unknown reason its WiFi also keeps turning itself on. I can't seem to keep it off no matter how often I manually turn it off.For Apple being so USER-FRIENDLY, I cannot at all say that it is. In fact, IT IS ANYTHING BUT USER-FRIENDLY.  If the Apple World was so user-friendly, then it would be a very simple and easy transition from the Windows or Google platform to Apple. And I can honestly say it is Not at all simple or easy. I was so hoping it would be as simple & easy as my Windows machine & Android phone, but sadly, it's actually quite maddening.If you enjoy Kindle reads, you'll need to install the app for it. But I can also tell you, Apple's iBook seriously pales in comparison to Kindle. Ironically, the Google Search Engine is installed on Apple's iPhone but Kindle is not. I avoid Google anything & everything as much as can be done. But for Apple to deny Amazon's Kindle Apple on its phones, seems almost a crime.I have yet to install the Kindle reading app or to test out the camera on the iPhone. When I do I'll update my review. But currently I can't say it's anything to brag about. And I most certainly did not expect to see Google's Search Engine/Web Browser on it.Size wise, it's the exact same size as my Sony Xperia Z3v. It still functions quite well. Not perfect, but well enough for me since I have it locked to call, text, Kindle reads & camera.  I can easily read, pinch & zoom & highlight my Kindle reads, pictures & text messages on it. Can only do that with pictures on the iPhone. So for it being so great, I actually find it quite limiting. Not because it's an iPhone, but because the Apple creators decided to create a platform that is quite complex and extremely arduous to use. Apple created its own ""language"" that must be learned in order to navigate the complexities of its Eco-system.  Even now, trying to login to the Apple App Store, no keyboard appears so I can actually install Apps necessary for my personal use. Yet you're required to sign in to it. How can you sign into the App Store when NO KEYBOARD APPEARS TO LET YOU?! So, even if I did not want to use the phone feature, but instead use it as a computer tablet, I cannot because it won't let me login to the App Store. ... Like I said, to anyone new to the Apple world, it's quite a infuriatingly maddening conundrum. If Apple wants to gain new customers and retain them, then Apple needs to change how it operates. And if Apple is supposed to be the safest of all online platforms, then it should not sport Google's web browser.The phone I received was/is like brand new. Operating it though, takes considerable patients as it is quite the learning curve. It should not be so difficult to transition from Windows, Android or Google to Apple. They all made sense to everybody from the moment they came out because they were in simple English and easily understood and simple to navigate because of it. Apple on the other hand, not by a long shot. Even Apple's touchscreen capabilities sorely lacks in comparison. And that's sad. You'd think their touchscreen capabilities would be at least on-par with Windows, Google & Android but it is not. You'd think Apple's touchscreen capabilities might even be better than Windows, Android & Google, but no. Thus far I can find nothing to brag about regarding Apple anything. I was so hoping to find something better about Apple. Instead, I'm greatly disappointed and left seriously frustrated.The iPhone itself came fully charged and appears in brand new condition. It also came with an original Apple Charger.I give the seller a stellar 5 star rating, along with the iPhone I received.I give Apple itself a mediocre 3, even 2 star rating.So to anyone new to the Apple world, maybe an iPad would be easier to use. I started with a phone since I need both a new phone & a new computer and figured Apple would be a serious upgrade to Windows and for sure compared to Google's Android. ... Apple is not at all user-friendly to a first time user. Only Windows, Google & Android can actually claim user-friendly bragging rights, from day one for any first time user.Apparently I need either direct Apple support or YouTube's Apple education in order to learn how to make the best use of this phone.  I don't fault the phone for anything. It's an Apple thing. It's very nearly like you gotta go to MIT to learn it. And that's just not right.Will update as I learn how to navigate Apple's world & extremely clunky Eco-system.1st Time Apple iPhone User Assessment. -Phone - good. - can't give it high marks due to Apple itself.Apple - not worth all the money & certainly nothing to brag about."
401,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"I purchased this phone with the intent of having it for a very short period of time.  My plan was to use it as a trade-in since my previous phone was too old to qualify (iPhone 6 Plus).  I purchased the phone for around $250 and got an $800 trade-in value on an iPhone 14 Pro Max, when switching from one carrier to another.  I'd been with the previous carrier for 20 some years but it was time for a change.The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars, is that it had non-Apple parts on it that the new carrier was somehow able to identify, maybe battery, maybe screen?  Perhaps there is some history somewhere of previous iPhone repairs.  Anyway, the replacement parts were determined to be acceptable and the $800 credit was given.  I ended up using the phone for a couple of weeks while waiting for my new phone to come in.  The phone functioned to my satisfaction.I didn't rate the face recognition because after two attempts, I did not get it to work.  My wife said I wasn't doing it right and that may be the case.  I was trying to follow the camera with my eyes when moving the phone around in the circle.  The app completed, be then said I was unable to use face recognition.  The front camera did work, so again, perhaps the failure was unrelated to the phone.For anyone who wants to try to save a few hundred dollars on trading in a phone, this may be the way to go.  As I found out though, there could potentially be some risk depending on the parts used for any repairs made."
402,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"Sooooâ€¦ for all the people giving 1 star for having to waste money trying to connect to a phone plan and claim it wonâ€™t connect, I have a solution!!! Go to settings then general then about then scroll down to carrier lock. If you look right beside carrier lock it tells you if itâ€™s locked into a carrier. Mine has said from the time I turned it on â€œno SIM restrictionsâ€. It connected to metro pcs with zero problems. It is charging great! Super fast too! Everything works as it should! My only complaint is that it has a few dings. Nothing major but a couple of dings and a few light scratches. Not an issue. It is used not new of course. I like it and my kid will too! Thanks Amazon! I will update if we have any problems with it."
403,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"I was really nervous about ordering this product because of the reviews. However, I decided to order the product and wait. When it arrived I opened the box and inside was the phone with a screen protected already on, inside a bubble wrap casing. With the charger and the little charger plug(?). It came with the SIM card thingy to take it out. When inspecting the phone I noticed it had very few scratches on one of the sides. The phone set up was great, just follow directions step by step. Great product honestly, and for the price itâ€™s great. Battery life was a little low 87% battery capacity but still great. Overall, really good phone. Shipping was SUPER FAST. I ordered it on a Sunday 11/13/2022, was supposed to get it a Wednesday 11/16/2022 and it arrived on a Tuesday 11/15/22."
404,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,Iâ€™ve wanted to buy an iPhone off of Amazon for a while now but I was scared to get a renewed one in case there were any issues. I decided to simply go for it because you can always return if youâ€™re not pleased but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be returning my phone any time soon. It looks wonderful and it works smoothly. May update with pictures later if thatâ€™s possible.
405,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,This is my 2nd used iphone Ive gotten from Amazon. My wife bought 2 as well. I am not the guy that is into getting a new phone every year. I hold on to my phones as long as I can. I pay cash for it vs financing a phone like some do and cant justify spending over $1k on a phone when people sell cars for $1k-$2k. Phones have always worked fine and each one was a fair price. I will continue to buy my phones from Amazon until I get a reason not to.
406,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"The phone was labeled as â€œexcellent condition.â€ I had purchased a phone from Amazon renewed around two years ago, the phone I received then was in near perfect condition with no visible scratches/scuffs when examining. However, I canâ€™t say the same about this purchase. The iPhone XR I purchased from the same seller as before had scuffs around the rear camera casing, dust scratches (probably from cases) and had a few minor scratches on the front. The battery health was a 100% (probably replaced with an unofficial battery). Iâ€™m still keeping the phone because itâ€™s an emergency but donâ€™t expect to get a perfect looking phone. 6.5/10.Update: Iâ€™m returning this because Iâ€™ve found a better looking used iPhone XR from a different seller!"
407,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,Iâ€™ve had the phone for almost 10 months now and honestly have little to no complaints. I upgraded from an iPhone 7 to the XR (yes I know Iâ€™m always behind). Iâ€™d recommend the XR for somebody who wants to remain in the Apple ecosystem without breaking the bank. Maybe the battery life could be a little better for somebody like myself who puts a lot of hours into my phone. But itâ€™s dependable and if you have a prior iPhone you can set it up almost instantly. Gonna try to make this phone last as long as possible
408,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,I have had this phone for a few months now. It has little to no issues. There were no scratches that I could personally see and the set up was super easy. the box it came in was a little sketchy. there wasn't a whole lot of protection around the phone but I mean the phone came in almost perfect condition. The battery life is a little crappy. total charge is at 86% and it does die a little faster than I would like but that is manageable just by turning on battery saver mode. maybe it is just an iPhone thing but some of the apps will say they have notifications but when I go into them nothing shows up. Seeing as this is really my first iPhone I would say its pretty good.
409,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"I think I got lucky because there is absolutely nothing wrong with what I got (cosmetic or otherwise) it works like a dream and charges to 100%.Itâ€™s important to do research and really take other reviews into account before buying. I read mixed reviews, took a chance and purchased, and am over the moon happy with what I got. Might as well be a new phone with how it looks and operates."
410,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"This ""renewed"" iPhone XR is good, although the first one I received had to be returned because it wouldn't read a sim card.  It took more than two weeks to get the money back from returning the first one.  The replacement phone seems like a new one.  Good battery life; no issues."
411,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,mannn im soo happy it came fast i havent had a phone in like 3 years and i been wanting this phone ever since it came out now i have it this was not a scam the phone looks great and it was cheap im soo in love p.s. i got the red one .
412,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"I asked for my phone to be renewed fairly okay for cheaper, and my phone came in BRAND NEW, not a single SCRATCH, no crack no nothing , speaker sounded GREAT, comes with a charger, and is very nicely package, Iâ€™ve bought so many red iPhone XRâ€™s off Amazon from different people and this was by far the overall BEST ONE. Thank u , I WILL use yall again! âœ…âœ…âœ…"
413,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"The phone came in a generic box and had a generic cord and wall plug included.  No visible scratches, hard to tell it wasnâ€™t brand new.  Battery had 80% battery life left, which is why it got a 3.  Would purchase again, it shipped quickly and the price was good.  Needed it to replace a broken iPhone14."
414,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"El telÃ©fono estÃ¡ en muy buen estado, no tiene ningÃºn golpe o quebradura en la pantalla o la parte de atrÃ¡s del telÃ©fono. La baterÃ­a tiene un 86% de vida pero es un telÃ©fono que saliÃ³ al mercado hace un tiempo es entendible, pero todo funciona muy bien, ademÃ¡s viene sin ningÃºn bloqueo de lÃ­nea que es lo una de las cosas mÃ¡s importantes."
415,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,I like it so far I see it fine Itâ€™s working very well I but it for my son he like it he havenâ€™t complained the screen the face recognition and battery looks good so far I say if I need another one I definitely will buy it again If I donâ€™t see nothing bad!
416,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"I ordered the iPhone Xr in Â¨good condition Â¨ and it came in okay condition, to be honest. The phone did come with scratches which were very noticeable on the side of the phone and on the top (Luckily there were no scratches on the camera) I was fine with the scratches and the color coming off and expected it since I did buy the phone in good condition, And I wasn't too bothered by it because I was just gonna put a case on it and no one would notice. The phone did come with tons of little scratches on the screen, that you can't see at all with a screen protector on, but off, it was very noticeable (if you look at it closely) It looked like someone ran their nails on it but it again it was fine because I had a screen protector on it.The battery life on the phone was 87% which is not too bad and was better than I was expecting.All in all, I love the phone so much, it's amazing in my opinion and I couldn't care about the cons, But if you're a person that cares a lot about the cosmetic features and the quality of the phone, Then I recommend that you either buy it in excellent condition (can't guarantee it'll be better since I don't know) or you just keep looking. Ill update you in 3 months!"
417,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,Got it for my mom and it's like new! No problems and very happy !!!
418,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,When I saw some comments I nearly stop buying this phone. But said let me try my luck. The phones arrived very fast and they were practically new phones. I bought them them for my teenage boys and there are happy and love the phones. Thanks
419,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"The packaging was a concern because it only had the bubble wrap protecting it but â€¦Looked brand new, had a few scratches but not too noticeable.. it also came like 4 days earlier:) also came with a chargerJust started using it so Iâ€™ll see how it goes"
420,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,I ordered the excellent condition and it only had a few scratches around the camera lens but has no affect on the camera. Front screen has minor scratches but other than that I absolutely loved it!
421,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,This iphone arrived earlier than expected.  It is in excellent condition.  i could hardly tell it was used!!  Very happy customer!
422,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"I bought as a gift for my brother to upgrade him from a older iPhone and he loves it! Battery is good, camera quality and all in all he is happy with it!"
423,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"This was a birthday gift for my daughter. She has had it for over 4 months and has had zero issues. Phone arrived looking brand new, with charger. Will be purchasing more for myself, husband and mother."
424,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"Face recognition is very fine, Battery life is not too good just 89% and donâ€™t take too much time without charging. The Screen is fine very clear. The cellphone looks very good, I liked. Looks like new"
425,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,This is an amazing product im happy it came no straches cracks everthing was perfect some reviews made me question but dont be scared BHHT this iphone xr white 64gb it great
426,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"Esta en perfectas condiciones, nunca habÃ­a comprado un telefono reacondicionado y tenÃ­a mis dudas pero fue una buena compra!Se lo regale a mi hija y esta feliz!"
427,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,Very satisfied with the quality and I appreciate how the p  hi one came in the box with a screen protector and extras for later installation. Worth the price.
428,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,I went on a search for a new phone when my renewed 8S finally gave up the ghost. I wanted a phone that was functional without the need for glitz and glamour. My son-in-law put the XR at the top of his preferred list. The renewed phone I received from Kiss Electronics exceeded my expectations. It appears brand new in function and performance. Battery life is 86%. I especially like the way Kiss packaged the phone was for protection. It came with a new charging cable and SIM card key. The price was reasonable as well.
429,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,I was very nervous about purchasing a reconditioned phone.  Wife made fun of me and called me cheap. The phone is spotless and runs great. Call quality is excellent and camera is great. I bought the same iPhone XR brand new a few years ago and gave that one to my son and now I use this one.  The reconditioned phone has been great and is worth the savings.
430,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"The phone seems to be in great condition. The battery life wasnâ€™t however on 100%, yet it was on 89% overall seems like a decent phone I have set it up and I am using it. Letâ€™s see how it goes! Thanks!"
431,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"Iâ€™ve been an Android user since the beginning but finally decided to switch to Apple based on recent and upcoming Google changes.Very happy with this iPhone XR! I chose this model because it was new enough while not being too heavy an investment.  I was using a MotoZ and this XR is equal in size and efficiency. I also used a Samsung Note10 and this is a bit smaller.  The size fits nicely into my small purse and pockets. I chose the 256GB because I know having a faster phone with more storage matters. Nothing worse than a sluggish device.The face recognition works great and is much handier than using my fingerprint. I havenâ€™t had any issues logging in regardless of how my hair is styled and whether Iâ€™m wearing glasses or not.I love the color! Itâ€™s more of an orange than red. The camera is faaar better than any of my previous phones, except for the Sony I once owned.This model came with the power cord, power plug, and ear pods making it ready to go straight out of the box. Just needed to give it a good charge before using.Buying refurbished devises has been something Iâ€™ve had only success with. Iâ€™m always careful and do my research on the seller before buying. Plus I invest in the extended warranty through Amazon plus in this case I chose Apple Care. Money is always a huge issue for me but in this case I wonâ€™t buy without the added protection. Phones are too essential not to.Learning the Apple layout and differences has been new but not a struggle. I find the biggest issue is the power button is on the opposite side of the device. For things I havenâ€™t known how to do Iâ€™ve used Apple.com and searched Google.Itâ€™s impossible to get away from Google completely but at least I know my info is safe now.I would totally recommend this seller and product to friends and family!"
432,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,This phone works bery well and with a 86% battery life itâ€™s quite suitable for everyday use so far.
433,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"So far everything works perfectly. No problems with camera, sound, face recognition, battery life is good, and screen quality is just right."
434,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"The phone is great no problems , but the camera is fuzzy and blurry if you want to take a picture of someone or something"
435,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"The phone arrived just as described. For a refurbished item, I just noticed a couple small scratches on the back,  and the battery life is 91%. My grandson said that was really good for a phone this old.  So for just having it a week,  I think it's just as good as new for the fraction of the price.Thank you!!"
436,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"Phone is an IPhone X. It looks great, works great when it wants to. It does have an issue called â€œGhost touchâ€ which is common on the iPhone X. It opens apps and causes areas of messages not to work, will swap phone calls when you have multiple callers. It is  a pain in the butt!  Phone looks great and works fine 50% of the time.  It is a know issue with IPhones and it wasnâ€™t corrected on this refurbished phone. The other iPhone I bought from them works just fine."
437,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,This is my 2nd refurbished phone from amazon. I got the excellent condition iphone XR and it looks great and seems to work fine and unlocked
438,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,The phones work real good
439,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,Bought this for my daughter.  She's been bugging me for 2 years to get her an iPhone.  I can't afford anymore $on our Verizon bill so I said no.  Then she sent me the info for this and I decided to take a chance.  She loves it!  I won brownie points with my daughter and Amazon won brownie points with me.  I did purchase the insurance though just to be on the safe side.
440,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,This IPhone looks brand new.  Not a scratch or blemish any where.  Takes great pictures too!  Thank you TRADEMORE SERVICES for sending a great phone!
441,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"the first thing i will say is directed towards everyone no matter what phone you get, i highly recommended you check EVERYTHING when you buy a used/renewed phone. such as water damage (open the sim tray and shine a light inside you should see a little strip. if itâ€™s white your phone isnâ€™t water damaged, if itâ€™s red or pink, it is damaged inside. id recommended watching a video to help with that as well to make sure youâ€™re doing it correctly) you should also check the battery life (settings-battery-battery health-battery capacity. you should have above 85% imo but amazon renewed promises 80% or higher for normal refurbished, 90% or higher for premium.) you should also check the authenticity of the phone. (settings-general-about-press model number-search up serial number on apple.com. when you press your mode number, the first letter will either be M or some other numbers (google to find out.) but M means this is an official apple phone and wasnâ€™t replaced as a part of apple care+ or etc.) obviously check the screen, display and chipset by either running benchmarks by an app or jus looking it up :) ) i canâ€™t think of anything else to test. so i will say that this is amazing tbh, perfect condition only a tiny nick toward the top of the phone, 89% battery life, for only $240 this is an amazing deal :) buy it if you have the money it is an amazing phone, some sellers may sell bad phones etc so just be careful what seller you buy it from."
442,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,Honestly so far so good I got the blue iPhone xr !! I love it. It got here sooner then expected which was a plus !
443,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,The phone came two days earlier than the expected arrival date so that was a plus.It looks very new and I am pleased with the outer appearance. However the screen quality for the â€œtouchâ€ is on and off. The middle and bottom part of the screen reacts to my finger touching it but I have to tap the screen significantly harder for the top half of it.It comes with the tool to put in your SIM card and a charger.I will be monitoring it for awhile and give an update if needed.But so far 8/10
444,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,I only had the phone for a day. My only complaint is the battery life. I know itâ€™s used but it feels like the battery dies a little fast.
445,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"Everything Is Perfect , Works As It Should Performs Ad Should Also , It Came Wen Expected To , Even Included A Glass Screen Protector Already On It & Also A Charging Cable (NoFastCharger) W/The A/C Wall Adapter"
446,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"Itâ€™s a great phone for the year, Iâ€™ve only had a couple of glitches here and there but nothing major. Itâ€™s pretty durable even without the case or screen protector camera quality is great! Love this phone so far. The battery life is okay I received 91 of battery capacity noting major but this phone is a steal for the price!"
447,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,The phone works great!
448,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,"I was a bit nervous getting renewed but I'm on a budget and I had to buy this plus the Apple Watch 6 for health tracking purposes. There is absolutely no scuffs, dings, or scratches. The only way you can tell it is renewed was battery life was about 89% Which isn't horrible. It still lasts me the day and as this isn't brand new, I'm not dinging a star for that. (Plus I believe that is better than advertised)This along with the watch were my first ever Apple products. I previously had a Moto Stylus and a Samsung Galaxy Active 2 Watch. I wanted a watch that would alert me when I had an Afib episode, which the samsung didn't. A lot of afib patients suggest Apple watch for this, which meant I needed an Apple phone.The battery, even new, I don't think would have outperformed my Moto but that's a thing Moto is kinda known for is their big batteries. But as mentioned before, it lasts me all day.I LOVE the blue color. I bought a rugged clear case from local store so that I could protect it while still being able to see the pretty color.Had zero problems putting Mint Mobile on it, so unlocked as promised. Never used an esim before so that was really neat.The apps are amazing and far more varied than Android. That night time wind down is no joke, but I like it. It really is great at making sure I don't pick up my phone and just mess around after bed time and I like that it gives me a little warning so I can go read or do something to wind down for bed.Display is clear and nice.Performance is snappy. A little sad there's not a headphone jack but that's pretty typical these days. Just nice to have something for when your earbuds run out of juice. But it synced upOverall, I know this phone is a bit older in 2022 but I honestly feel like it's almost better than some of the flagship Android phones that are new at a lower price. Overall, I'm really happy. It's really helped become a health tracker as much as a phone. I'm getting why people like Apple now and will probably buy more apple products in the future."
449,Apple,Iphone XR,64 GB,IOS 12,6.1 Inches,Shipping was faster than expected. Phone was is visible great shape. However battery life is terrible.
450,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Review Update 11/21/22I'm really quite pleased with this phone. It does everything my older S9+ did. The step-down in size and weight were just what I was looking for. It feels much more comfortable in my shirt pocket.Review Update 11/15/22One of the things I've been noticing lately is my 4 year old Galaxy S9+ battery charge duration is deteriorating. Today I've spent 3 hours setting up the new S10e. So, with both phones starting at 100%, I've had the phones powered up side-by-side. At this moment the S9+ shows 55% charge and the S10e shows 70% This is much better than I expected.Initial Review 11/14/2022I've had a Galaxy S9+ for 4 years. Three things have always bothered me. I decided to buy this inexpensive used phone to improve my daily interaction with phones. It turns out better than expected.For a used phone it could easily pass for brand new. There are no marks, blemishes, or any other things that would give away the fact that this phone is used.It came with Android 12, a welcome surprise. It has been doing software update downloads, perhaps 4 in all, to bring it even more up-to-date.The three things I didn't like about the S9+ are the overall size, the weight, and the curved edge of the display. this S10e fulfills my wish list for those three issues. The flat screen, replacing the curved edges of the S9+, is the biggest improvement to me. With the curved edges of the S9+ my fingers wrapped around both sides of the phone where they would touch the curved edges creating unwanted actions of the phone. I wanted a smaller and lighter phone because I carry my phone in my shirt pocket where size matters.I used the app Smart Switch on both phones to copy apps, data, photos, videos, and more from the old to the new phone.Other than my app icons scattered all over the screens the rest of the data seems to have transferred properly.After I install and arrange the apps I will then be ready to move the SIM card from the old to new phone.At this point I can easily recommend this phone."
451,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"I'm not sure if you all go in for the analog features like I do, but they are such a delight to me. The pleasant feel of haptic feedback. The accessibility of a rotary knob. Why, I didn't realize how much I used the physical power button on my TV until I bought one without it. Seriously, I go to walk out the door, expecting to be able to turn the thing off on my way, only to have to walk all the way across the room to grab the remote and perform the same function. How asinine. But I digress...The three primary bells and whistles of this phone are the fingerprint scanner, the expandable storage, and the I-can't-believe-this-is-now-a-feature-audio-jack. In reverse order, the audio jack continues to be an audio jack. Wonderful differential signals continue to come flooding out of the terminal into my heart, bringing the hits of the 80s, 90s, and today. I don't think I'm alone in seeing that no one cares about the thinness of phones. I like a bit more to hold personally, and we all put them into massive cases anyway.The expandable storage is something that I haven't tried yet but am glad exists. I will likely try this feature in the future when I take a few more videos and pictures. Great camera, by the way.Finally, the fingerprint scanner. Based on its placement, it's more of a thumbprint scanner. What a terrific idea this inclusion is. It's readiness to scan is unparalleled. Even the most haphazard toss of one's fat and disgusting thumb onto the reader is no match for the pattern-recognizing proficiency of this beast. It's speed is what really takes the cake. Compared to what I've seen with the S22 (the new hotness at time of review), this is sufficiently faster. I was hesitant at first with the necessary asymmetry that case makers have needed for this phone, but what I once saw with aversion, I now approach with the delight of a wee schoolgirl with a temporary tattoo. Which is why I request, from this particular corner of the Internet, that phone makers should do more stuff like this. I miss the heart rate monitors of yester-years as well. I don't care about how sexily slim the new stuff is. In what here appears imperfect, I have found true beauty.And I will continue to appreciate that beauty for the next 9 months or so until the security updates run out, at which point I'll probably switch to something newer and more dumb. Stupid sexy S22..."
452,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"The quality of the phone is great! I had an S9 with a cracked screen so decided to buy this renewed phone instead of repairing the screen which would have cost me $200+. I was able to transfer all my messages, photos, apps, contacts, etc. without an issue. The phone looks brand new. Picture quality is immaculate! I just received the phone so I can't speak on quality of battery life, but the phone seems to be in NEW functioning condition. I've used Samsung mobile phones for several years and have never had an issue. I prefer these older versions because they seem to last very long, and I also like having the headphone jack feature.I say ""go for it!"" Just make sure you select the correct options of either unlocked or a specific carrier. I chose T-Mobile, but I received an unlocked version, which is fine, because it's working well. I am texting and making phone calls without an issue.Best!"
453,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"This is a ""renewed"" Samsung S10e, I've always loved Samsung phones and this one did no disappoint. Bought this as a secondary phone for travel to Asia along with my Flip4. The only disappointment is the charging block and cable that cam with phone is not Samsung and is defective, hard to insert and have to wiggle to get connection. I know the cord and block are defective because using my other old block and cords and it worked seamlessly! I have contacted seller for a new block and cord, waiting to see if they respond... love the phone though."
454,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"It is a decent device for the most part. Especially the fingerpring reader on the side.However, the battery life is so bad I have to charge it twice a day.AccuBattery measured the effective battery capacity at 85% so it's not a dying battery to blame."
455,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,The phone is great & is in excellent condition as stated!  It said phone was unlocked and I even got an answer when I posted a question that it would work with my carrier! Was very frustrating!  First I spoke with Amazon support who then transferred me to Samsung who referred me to Verizon!  Uggghh! Verizon did unlock the phone but the process was slow and aggravating!
456,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Simple and light weight. Works as expected for the price. Do not compare with iPhone. No way near the camera of recent iPhones
457,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Item and packaging was top notch, but seemed as if shipping took longer then expected and paid for. But all together I was very satisfied to say the least.Wish it would have came with a provided individual SIM card however was only dislike about entire order!"
458,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Broke my pixel 4a, so I wanted a cheap replacement phone. after searching Amazon for a while, I settled on this. This phone hit high remarks for me with the screen, processing power, and most importantly size of the phone. Having expandable memory on top of the 256 gigs of storage is a bonus. Just wish the battery life was better. it's older tech so it get the job done"
459,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Came with a glass screen saver on already so you don't see the scratches on the screen. But it function properly and I needed the phone now so we kept it and it's doing good. The after market plug didn't work and was causing an error symbol to appear on the screen. I just picked one up at the local Walmart and it went away.
460,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"battery life is long. you can customize it to your specifications. the durability is pretty good. I'm clumsy, so I've dropped it a few times without a case, and there aren't any problems with it. I recommend this product to anyone looking to upgrade"
461,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"arrived in perfect condition, with OEM charger. solid battery life and the capacitive fingerprint reader performs as expected. face unlock uses the selfie camera, YMMV. runs games well without getting too toasty, with exceptions for intensive games like genshin, war robots, etc. best samsung phone to buy currently with waterproofing, sd card slot, 256GB onboard storage and a headphone jack if you donâ€™t mind 60hz.TL;DR: Still a good buy at anything below $300."
462,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Facial recognition, fingerprint reader and battery life are all within expected ranges. Nice camera picture quality. Overall a good phone and worth the price paid. Definitely recommend!"
463,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,I was a bit worried about ordering a renewed phone but the phone I got was great. No damage at all! Looked new. I ordered the unlocked version and that is what I got. The phone is working great and I had no problem switching my service to it.
464,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Orderd in prism white. Beautiful phone , battery lasts most the day with heavy use. Amazon renewed has yet to disappoint. Can't really beat the price."
465,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"I ordered this mobile device for my mother to replace her hopelessly outdated S4.The device arrived in like-new condition with all expected accessories, was unlocked as advertised, and adapting to the chosen carrier and cloning her S4 was flawless.I'm ordering another one now just to have on hand."
466,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Good enough, it's Carrier unlocked instead of factory unlocked but it doesn't makes any difference. The overall looks are great. And Samsung s10e is one of the best phones imo because of the handy size and good capabilities."
467,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"No flaws.  Easy setup.  Was hoping unlocked would have no bloatware, but a bunch was present that would not delete.  Lots of memory so it is not a deal breaker."
468,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,The phone itself is in great shape but there was a dent in the frame by the fingerprint reader.
469,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,It's a little smaller than I expected. I always had  Moto phones so it took awhile to figure it out. Still can't figure out how to turn up the volume when using GPS.  Can hardly hear it.
470,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Already purchased 2 of these and am very satisfied with both purchases. One of them had some minor scratches on the volume button but other than that both came in great conditions!
471,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Excellent condition and good price.  Happy with purchase.
472,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"I went back and forth with the decision to purchase a refurbished phone on Amazon. Seems a little sketchy, but my old phone was a cheap Samsung, like $50 from Best Buy cheap, and it was a real turd. I just can't bring myself to pay $400 or more dollars for something that has a high risk of easily being broken. Plus I'm on a tight budget. But I really wanted a decent camera and some bells and whistles that the cheap ones just don't offer. I absolutely was in love with the color of this one, it's almost has an opalescent quality to it. So I went for it, initially upon receiving the phone I thought the camera glass was broken and I was pretty bummed. But I thought I'd try out the operating system and see if I liked it, I was so impressed, world's above a $50 Samsung, universes maybe! I was hooked, I didn't want to send it back. I decided I would try to replace the camera glass myself if they gave me a partial discount refund. They did, 30%. I ordered the glass replacement kit and watched a YouTube video, in the video the guy heats the glass to loosen the glue holding the camera glass in place with a blow dryer, so I do the same and low and behold when I went to gently pry the glass up, it had a glass screen protector! It was what was broken and what was causing my photos to look foggy. After peeling the broken cover off I wiped the fresh camera glass off well, snapped a pic and WoWww, such clarity, such vivid colors, such a great camera! I love love love this phone, no complaints in the least!! Glad I took a leap and bought it!"
473,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"I love the size and the weight but does not hold a charge all day and it will not allow me to send out more than 10 text at a time and I have prayer groups of 25 , I could send out 20 on my  S 10.."
474,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Just I want to say Thank you guys , because first time I tough the cell phone was locked but I send a question to you and your response was quickly and resolved my issue , the cell phone is unlocked and working as designed, Great Technical support and quickly,  I recommend this Company and before return any phone just call or sent the questions first to this Technical support group."
475,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"The product arrived a day after through Amazon Prime in a amazon renewed box. Packaging was pretty much on par with factory packaging, and included the s10e, generic charging brick and cable along with sim card tray tool.PHONE'S PHYSICAL CONDITION: The s10e was pretty much in ""like new"" shape cosmetically aside from a bit of residue around the cameras that easily wiped off. Also has very little amount of grim in the corner of the upper speaker that I don't care to clean out. ALSO had very small damage on the lower left corner of the unit on the bezel and very little on the screen. I had to inspect to find it. Nonetheless with a case and screen protector the phone is like a brand new phone cosmetically.SOFTWARE: Android 12 with One UI 4 on the s10e is snappy and ready to work! (comes updated). I'm a serious multitasker and so far I haven't had much complaints at all. Camera is great. Only gripe with this is that typing properly is a bit of a task ( I am coming from an A51 with a much larger and slightly wider screen).I specifically chose the s10e not only for its size but also for the fingerprint sensor on the power button. It's pretty much instant.BATTERY LIFE is naturally horrible. Small phone = small battery. Especially when paired with the same processing power as its bigger brothers. Will not last an entire day with a power user or even with a kid on youtube."
476,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,I was very happy with the customer service from the seller! They answered the phone and where very helpful! I recommend this company. The phone came as expected and was just as advertised.
477,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Buying this ""refurbished"" (but actually unused) 128gb 2019 phone cost me only $10 more than replacing the battery of my 32gb 2015 iPhone 6S. That should speak for itself I think."
478,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,I had a long haul with this one said it was delivered but didn't receive it. Back and forth with seller and Amazon and police department and frustration and awaiting refund review....Only for package to just turn up at the apartment main office on Sept. 6th.Either way I am very happy and my brother did the unbound and he said it looked scratch free so while I didn't like the treatment and or customer service that was rendered to me I am happy because I received the package. I hope I never experience this again.
479,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Works great just remember to factory reset before using. I had a admin monitor that basically spies on your device and wasn't able to delete it so a factory reset will help wipe everything away
480,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"I bought this renewed phone and received an S10e in beautiful condition. When I had fully charged it and turned it on, the AT&T logo showed and I thought I might have a problem since I am using Total Wireless, a second tier carrier that uses the Verizon network. I ended up returning what was most probably a perfectly good item due to my service providers dropping the ball. They said the phone was incompatible and, I have since come to believe that was not the case.The listing included Verizon among the compatible carriers. Upon activation, I was able to make and receive calls but I had no 4g/LTE data connection, just WIFI. After delving into the problem with a customer service agent, I was advised that the phone was incompatible. AT&T uses GSM and Verizon uses CDMA so I thought the incompatibility verdict seemed reasonable.In working with the carriers CS agent, he had me go into settings>connections>mobile networks>network mode. There you will see a list with one of the choices checked indicating the setting the phone is on. He told me to select ""Global"" . When I told him there was no ""Global"" or ""LTE/CDMA"" selection, he said the phone was not compatible.  Pic 1 is my old S6, which I am replacing, and Pic 2 is the S10e.The CS agent also had me go into the Access Point Names. There was no access point listed, just some text saying ""not available to this user"" or something similar. No further input at all from the agent  on the access point angle, or why phone calls were working but not data, just ""the phone is not compatible"" Looking back now, at this point the agent should have walked me through setting up an access point. He didn't, so I sent back my ""incompatible"" phone.There was no problem at all returning the phone over the incompatibility issue. I then bought a second, used S10e from a different listing that described a Verizon phone so I figured I would be all set. Sure enough, it is a Verizon phone but imagine my surprise when I  encountered the exact same problem.Long story short, the FIX was that I need to manually set up/add an access point. I touched/opened the access point on my old S6 and replicated the settings  into the ""add access point"" on the S10e, and everything works fine.  I got the idea for the fix from a YouTube video. I guess they don't watch YouTube over at Total Wireless.I am certain this fix would have worked on the first, ""incompatible"" phone I ended up returning. I have since learned that the access point settings are supposed to download automatically on activation, but sometimes they don't. I would have expected a higher level of competency from my service provider's customer service. Ya Think? I can't help thinking that issues like this are deliberate corporate curveballs, designed to encourage customers to buy new phones direct from the carrier. JMHOTo sum up my review of this phone, I received an S10e in top notch condition and would highly recommend this renewed product."
481,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Broke my last phone, needed a fast replacement. Very happy with it!"
482,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,It has a scratch not too bad but quite visible. Works ok at the moment
483,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"The phone is perfect for my mom, she uses it to call and text as well as uses social media on it. Her battery will last her all day and usually charges in about 30 minutes. One downside is it does heat up a lot."
484,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"So my sister-in-law needed a spare phone for her business so I told her I'd check on Amazon as I've purchased a refurbished phone here b4 with great results. I found this S10e for $138 Completely refurbished with a 90 day return window. It showed up in 2 days as promised and it was super easy to Activate. They have an instruction sheet in the box. Basically the bigger phone companies will do an Auto Activation by just switching the sim card, restarting the phone. Then Reset Network settings do another reset and ur off. It super easy to do. The instructions also said to contact them if ur phone company couldn't help.So the phone, It has 128gb internal memory and a128gb memory card so lots of room for everything. This phone is locked to Verizon which is what I needed as she's a Verizon customer. So I went thru and set it up just like any new phone after that I got it charged fully and then used it all day, I made and received over 45 calls and at 5pm when I finished it still had 38% Battery life. Not bad for 9 hrs and over 45 calls along with texts and emails. The phone looks brand new I've not found a mark or blemish on the screen or the case. So for that price this so far is a great deal. The biggest thing for her is the 90 day return policy as she's never purchased a Refurbished phone b4.It is the S10e and is a little smaller than the S21 and A71 which is fine as its a business phone and not really used for personal stuff. I'll continue to update this review as I use it and see how it does over time. But overall I can't find any issues with it and it works great."
485,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Funciona todo
486,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Working great so far and even though it's renewed, I can't tell by looking at it. No scratches or dents, and no cracks. Great buy for the price."
487,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"I only just recieved the phone in the mail yesterday so I can only rate based off first impressions. So far, everything seems great. The phone looks perfect and I cannot detect any visual scratches or issues at all. It really does look a brand new phone. It turned on and set up was normal. I am not planning to hook it up to a phone service so I don't know if there could be potential issues with that. This phone will only be used with a wifi connection. Connecting it to wifi worked easily enough. We haven't had it for very long but I am already satified that there have been no issues so far. It did come with a charger and sim removal tool as indicated. I was pleasantly surpised that I was able to find this good of a deal. This phone is a newer model, has more GB memory, and was cheaper that all the other options I was looking at prior to purchasing this one. This option was also backed by Amazon so I can return it within 90 days if it doesn't work. I definitely rate this product 5 stars! If I do run into any issues, I may update the rating/review. I do want to mention that the seller I purchased the phone from was Chubbiestech, so I believe they are a pretty decent company. I believe there can be different sellers for the product so I can't speak for any others.**UPDATE**It's now November and we still love the phone. It is working correctly and had plenty of memory for my son to download a good amount of apps/games. I am still very satisfied with my purchase and I'm glad I was able to find this phone and get such a great deal!"
488,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"I essentially bought this phone because I wanted to get my mum a gift and have her upgrade the phone she had at the time. (which was a piece of garbage phone) - I previously had the Samsung Galaxy S9 and I only had it for less than a year and was working perfectly fine. The whole idea was to get my mum a better phone, so I bought this one (S10E) assuming it would be a lot better than the S9 I had, and boy was I mistaken. First of all, it's way too sleek and slippery, any surface it sits on it always slips and falls; S9 is a bit like that as well but no where close to the S10E. The battery life on this one is also terrible compared to the S9 I had. The volume is not as loud as the S9. And one more thing is that the S9 had a great feature that this one does not; and that is the small LED Light on the top left corner which flashed a different colour for a bunch of different things (example: when it flashed blue means I received a text, when it flashed yellow, I had a snapchat, purple was for whatsapp, red meant it had to be charged and so on). Really unsure why a phone of (supposedly) a higher level removed that feature and unsure why an older version is SO MUCH better than a new one. It also has a black dot on the top right corner for the front camera, which I also don't like. My recommendation is definitely don't get this phone. If you are considering an Android or a Samsung, I would much rather go for the S9, and I'm now really regretting buying this one and wish I would have just given this one to my mum and kept my S9."
489,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"This phone is more ok condition than excellent condition has a scrath near the camera but visible if you hold it close or really stare at it. A small dent near the antena band, the sides are clean, the back slightly scratched, charging port and earphone hole scrathed up but as I said it's OK but if the ''excellent condition'' looks ok then ''OK condition'' must look like crap. It runs very good though ...so far."
490,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Exactly as advertised
491,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,I liked that the phone came quickly!  It has great sound quality for phone calls.  It was in great condition when we received it.  It just works great so I recommend this phone!
492,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"The screen is not as big as I wanted , but it works just fine, it is not the color I wanted so I got a case for it.Other then that if I can't get the android phone I will just trade it on a apple , but it is working Great !Thank You ."
493,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,My mom loved it great phone light weight
494,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Arrived a day early and in good condition as expected.  I put my Sim card in and was ready to go.  No issues at all. cute phone!
495,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,I just needed this for basic usage for a free phone line. The phone looks new when held in front of my face and the battery functions good so far. It is a pretty fast food too. i would recommend.
496,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10e,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"The main thing I like about this Samsung S10 version (S10e) versus all the other ones like the S20 series, S10+ is that this has a microSD slot to get more storage AND a 3.5mm headphone jack WITHOUT having to buy any accessories.For less than $150, you get a phone with an amazing front and rear view camera, 6gb ram, super fast processor, and it already has a huge internal storage of 128gb! There's also a lot of neat functions this Samsung S10e can do like quick share Wi-Fi by generating a QR code on the Wi-Fi menu! No need to go to the router/modem or having to text your friends the password.If you're a global traveler like me, this phone is unlocked so you can use any SIM card on this. On idle, this phone can last about 3 days, with full use it's almost up to a day and it charges from 0 to 100 in less than 2 hours on normal charging speed.At this price, you're not losing out on much. If you're not worried about having a 3.5mm jack and one of the many people using Bluetooth headphones, there might be some better options out there, but this is still one of the best phones for under $150."

510,CUBOT,Max 3,64 GB,Android 11,6.95 Inches,"Ho comprato questo dispositivo per la grandezza dello schermo. Ho visto qualche video su Youtube (pochissimi in italiano) e non sembrava cosÃ¬ tremendo. Vi posso assicurare che questo smartphone Ã¨ la cosa peggiore mi sia capitata in mano. Anzi, diciamolo: Ã¨ proprio inutilizzabile. FInchÃ¨ non lo si usa, non ci si rende conto di quanto sia lento. Whatsapp a volte impiega anche fino a 8 (sÃ¬, 8!!!) secondi per aprirsi. Le app social come instagram e facebook sono praticamente inutilizzabili da quanto lentamente scorrono le foto, le notizie, ecc. Insomma, non lasciatevi abbagliare: il telefono Ã¨ brutto, inutilmente grande, con scarsa risoluzione, con batteria che scarica rapidamente, lento e con fotocamera penosa.  Diffidate dai video su youtube: se osservate bene mostrano solo home e operazioni basiche. Reso dopo neanche una settimana di utilizzo. Inoltre, se tenete anche solo 3 app aperte, il telefono si riavvia dal nulla: Ã¨ un bug diffuso, non Ã¨ capitato solo a me. NON COMPRATELO."

526,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"I have had a Moto Z Play on Republic Wireless for five years. In 2022, it was still supporting the basic stuff (calls, messages, music, navigation, videos, and browsing), and the battery was in good shape. But, they ended support for WiFi calling on this device. Now I am running the Nord N20 5G on Mint Mobile.It's similar in size, has the same near-stock android interface, exceptional battery life, crisp AMOLED display, lag-free Snapdragon 6 Series Platform, adequate camera, and limited OS upgrade support. Obviously, the processor is faster (Geekbench score of 2000 vs 500), the screen is larger (6.4"" vs 5.5"") and slightly brighter (461-647 nits vs 371-526 nits), the camera is sharper (64 MP vs 16 MP), the connectivity is better (faster WiFi, more 4G bands, and even a few 5G bands), and the OS is more recent (android 11 and 12 vs android 7 and 8). It was also 35% less expensive than the old phone ($275 with tax vs $435). And the new MVNO carrier is less expensive.The phone comes with a 33 watt charger and a USB-A to USB-C connector. It does not includes a case or screen protector. There is a tiny bit of bloatware, but it's easy to remove. The OxygenOS is easy to setup so that it feels like stock android. The finger print sensor and face unlock work very well. My only grip is that the WiFi sometimes connects to my slower 2.4 GHz channels instead of my 5 GHz channels. I actually have three 2.4 GHz channels and four 5 GHz channels in my house, and they all have the same SSID. Unlike my other phones, the OnePlus seems to only show a preference for the strongest signal. I may have to rename my 2.4 GHz SSIDs to prevent this.The most stressful thing I did on this phone was to install Google Home and cast the screen to a Chromecast connected to my computer monitor. The Chromecast is hard wired to my network and my phone was connected to a 5 GHz WiFi channel with a bandwidth of about 300 Mbs. The phone performed very well. While playing a youtube video via the Chrome browser, the video and audio were in sync on the monitor. While scrolling through my Google feed, there was hardly any lag on either the phone or monitor.I have been testing this phone, on and off, for over 12 hours with about 4 hours of screen on time. The battery is at 67%. This is consistent with a battery endurance rating of 129 hrs on gsmarena, which is better than all of the iPhones and Galaxy S Series phones. For reference, the iPhone 13 max pro is rated for 121 hrs, and the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G comes in at 114 hrs. Of course those phone are twice as fast, have a brighter 120Hz display, and much nicer cameras. But they also cost four times as much, and are running a bunch of extra processes that support all kinds of extraordinary features.If you want a mid-range phone, I would highly recommend this phone over the Samsung Galaxy A53 5G or Google Pixel 6a, both of which are about 30% more expensive. The A53 has descent battery life and better cameras, but is laggy and loaded with bloatware. The Pixel 6a has better cameras and a faster processor, but has poor battery life, is buggy, and even overheats. These other two phones will get more android upgrades, but these upgrades will most likely result in future issues with the phones. The only alternative that I would recommend to this phone is the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE, but only if you can get it new for $400."
527,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"I started with the iPhone 4 and just took my iPhone 7Plus out of service since Apple says it will not support iOS 16 or later.  Well, okay Apple...bye-bye.  So I moved to an Android platform; the OnePlus Nord N20 5G.  My FIRST Android mobile phone!  And yes, $230 feels much better than $700+ for a iPhone 14.  Ha, I have money left over to go purchase an Android watch.  I didn't switch due to not liking my 7Plus; an Apple mobile phone is all I've used for 12 years.  It simply boiled down to limiting the out of pocket expense of replacing a mobile phone that was approaching end of life.I've been using the OnePlus for three days and I already like it.  Everything works smoothly; not one issue thus far.  I think with an attitude of ""give it a try,"" moving from Apple to Android shouldn't be problematic for people.  Yes, ego and status can influence judgement.  The N20 operates a bit differently than my iPhone but the OnePlus is very capable and easily meets/exceeds my voice, texting, and photography needs....I'm not a ""power user"" by any means.  The Google Play store has all of the apps available that I had installed on my iPhone so I'm not having to deal finding alternatives.  Give me a couple of weeks to familiarize myself with the OnePlus and the operation will become second nature.  Just after three days, the iPhone seems ""clunky"" at this point.  Facetime and iMessages......so what!  The rest of my family will just have to deal with it.  Haha!If you happen to be a first time Android user and are looking for a great value the OnePlus Nord N20 should be on your short list.  Oh, I'm on T-Mobile.  New SIM card and 15 seconds later I was back in service."
528,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"I changed from a TCL 10l to a Nord N200 5G. I had an issue originally with the app switcher (right ğŸ”³ on 3 button nav bar) not working, even after factory resetting. They continued to work with me to resolve the issue and eventually escalated it to the devs, who also were great with communicating (and honest about not knowing what the issue is after a lot of troubleshooting, but would keep investigating).It turns out my prefered launcher that automatically installed at setup was the issue. I had to uninstall/reinstall the launcher and app switcher works. Uninstall/reinstall an app has resolved most of my issues. Now everything is working great and the battery lasts a long time even when playing games.The single speaker isn't great but at this price level corners get cut. It is still on Android 11 with no planned update to 12."
529,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,Don't expect alot of bells and whistles. It's got all the Android features you'd expect in a low budget phone. Alot and I meand alot of tips and videos on YouTube will help you with the phone. It's not a multitasker phone. Does not I repeat does not come with a music player. Or wireless charging. Read up before you buy so you know what you would have this for. I have multiple phone lines so this is my spam caller line for business. Personal no I'll stick to anything else. But a great back up phone for now. Battery is ok so long as you tone down certain things. Quick charge and I suggest from what I've read only use the charger it came with and your battery will be fine. If you want to make this your everyday. All in all not bad for the price. And all the extras like case and screen protector are cheap when you get it. So that's a plus. If anything goes wrong I'll update. But go for it if you're thinking of buying.
530,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"With Crickets service, Nord N20 ($230) is more favorable to my Moto G Stylus (2021, $145) that I gave to my son.  Speed is OK (2.2GHz, same as MOTO).  4G connection (no 5G supported) is reliable and clocks in around 40Mbs while a home WIFI is used a lot.  Battery lasts a whole day.  AMOLED screen is better.  Nord is light to carry.  Less apps also come installed.  Overall, I like it due to the screen, lightness and less junk apps.  BTW, I play no games, so I don't know about those, only about Internet (YouTube, Facebook, shopping), texting, phone service and overall daily activities.  Plus, I wait for so long for AMOLED to come down near 2 Benjamin's.  Any companies out there can beat this price with this type of screen?  NONE..."
531,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"So far this phone has been pretty dang great, I work for a cleaning company and we have to use an app for our service to clock in etc so I do find that it tends to use a bit more battery but it still last all day, I previously used Motorola brands I will never go back to them again. It has amazing cameras both front and back camera take beautifully stunning photos!!! Times the touch screen can be a little bit laggy but also I think that that could be my phone service just being an a pain!! Overall I'm very very happy with it definitely worth the price it's unlocked however if you do try to use straight talk it will not work because straight talk is now only  Verizon towers and this is unlocked for GSM only!"
532,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,Bought this to replace my delicate and always breaking Google Pixel and I genuinely keep forgetting that it isn't the Pixel because it is so nice. What a steal this phone is - I just wish I bought it first before dumping a ton of money into a junk product like the Pixel. That thing was so fragile that the guys at the UbreakIFix store all said they were notorious and they couldn't keep parts in stock for it.
533,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"I use a phone for phone calls, texting, playing music in the car, and occasional web browsing.  This phone does the trick.  I don't play games on the phone or watch movies so my graphics and processor demands are limited.  The camera is adequate for snapshots.  The second tier 5G capability is a nice to have although I found 4G adequate for my needs.  The hardware test was the browser front end for a Raspberry Pi music streamer.  My previous phone couldn't run it.  I think it was memory bound and the additional 2 GB made the difference in response time.  The only con for me is that it's a bit narrow making the landscape display too small in the vertical direction.  I have larger than average hands so I'm not at the human factors mid point.  I hope not to replace it for several years."
534,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"Battery life is great, checking an email /social media is fine, trying to watch videos including videos from my old phone are very choppy and jerky. Would not buy another one.11/30/22There was a big update and the video issues are corrected on my phone.  I tried a few different platforms and no issues.Now, I'd buy another one."
535,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,So far the first week I'm enjoying it. It's a different phone for my last one and it's taking a little bit of getting used to but overall it seems fast and that's when I need.
536,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,I like everything about the phone except for the battery life. It's seem to deplete as fast as my 3 year old phone that I replaced with this one. I probably exchange for a different model.
537,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"Whats the deal here? TMobile sells this phone yet the one I purchased from Amazon does not or cannot be used on TMO.  I first called Amazon but they could not help me on the phone. Then I called Sprint/TMO, same deal. Went to the store and thats when they told me it can not be used on the TMO network, what? So if I purchase it from them its okay? Purchase from someone else, NOT gonna work.  This may just be the start of something new that maybe the attorney general should know about.  So be aware if you are a sprint/tmo customer do not purchase this phone."
538,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,I purchased this as a replacement phone for my sister who accidentally dropped her phone and killed it. She had a OnePlus 6 and the phone is leaps and bounds better than her old phone. Super fast and responsive plus a camera that rivals many higher end phones. The battery life is easily good for a day and a half and the recharge is twenty minutes from 20% to a full charge. We have been using OnePlus phones for about three years and have never been disappointed!
539,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"For the price, this phone is a step up from my old Galaxy S8 and Xcover pro. Apps run smoothly without lag and the processor is fast to where it can do anything I throw at it. The 4500mah battery lasts me the whole day and although I'm missing the 60fps on cameras, 30fps isn't so bad either. I don't play games so I don't know for sure how it will perform with the Adreno 617 but I'm guessing it'll perform fairly well. For $300, 6GB ram, 128GB storage, and a big battery really, this makes the best bang for the buck phone. There have also been no problems that I have encountered since the purchase of this phone.Update October 6th: The phone has zero issues and I have since bought another one for my father as a gift and he seems to enjoy it over the company phone he received.Update November 2nd: The phone is still one of the best upgrades that I have gotten myself and my father. There is no issue with the phone and I still use it daily. One of the things that is really useful is that I don't have to worry about not having enough ram to run youtube in small-picture mode while browsing chrome, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, or reading manga on Tachiyomi. The main complaint I had about my s8 or Xcover pro was not having enough ram to multitask while having youtube open (picture in picture mode). Now, every time I check my ram usage while using youtube and browsers, I have at least 1.8GB or 2GB of ram ready in reserve and it helps a lot."
540,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"I bought this phone as a spare phone in addition to our more expensive iphones. This one exceeds my expectations for a entry level android phone as it is fast, well built and does not have much non-google UI stuff pre-installed that one needs to worry. The over response is snappy and the cam works fast and produces fairly high quality pictures."
541,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"For the price, this is the best phone on the market right now. Beautiful, fast and a good battery. The speakers are awesome; loud and clear.I do not usually like Android-based operating systems, but I cannot afford what Apple wants for phones and I am not willing to buy a phone without a headphone jack (this one has one, by the way). However, OnePlus has lots of really good system features and offers a good Android experience here. I love their file manager.The camera isn't anything spectacular, but as someone who uses DSLR cameras, I don't like to use a phone for anything spectacular anyway. This camera is more than fine for day-to-day family moments and the photos certainly are not ugly.The performance is not bad, either. I play games on it and have not had any lag issues."
542,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"Hard to beat for the price, especially if you can find it on sale!  I love that it has a headphone jack.  Works great on the T-Mobile network."
543,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"The OnePlus 2 was my first phone from their brand. I was extremely ecstatic with the direction One Plus was going in. The OnePlus 3 was my last phone, as soon as the OnePlus 3T came out they had moved in the direction of other major players in the market. They were overcharging for their devices and making incremental changes to sell a new phone.  With the release of this phone and my unhappiness with my recent Google Pixel 6 Pro, I decided to try OnePlus again. I am extremely happy with this phone. It's not like the old days when you bought a mid-range phone and you lost access to a lot of important features.  Frankly, this phone feels more responsive than my Pixel was, mostly because the 5G antenna is so much better.  I get 5G with this OnePlus phone where I wouldn't even get 4G on my Pixel.  Long story short, it's worth every penny.  Check the features before you buy it to make sure there's nothing you can't live without, but the only thing that I found most people probably won't like is the lack of wireless charging.  Other than that, I've been extremely happy."
544,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"Easy to hold and operate. I have had the phone for about a month and like the Wifi, screen display. No complaints."
545,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"Nice screen, battery and quick and responsive. All the bells and whistles on a budget phone"
546,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"This is a good phone. The OxygenOS is clean with almost no bloatware. But be cautious, I think this phone only works in T-Mobile's network (including MVNO, like Mint Mobile, Tello and etc.)."
547,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"I was tired of paying a lot to get an AMOLED screen. I was glad that I waited to get this one from Amazon and not from T-Mobile so as to not get the locked T-Mobile bloatware.  Nord N20 appears to really have good 5G antennas as I get good coverage in all my areas on T-Mobile or maybe it is just frequency bands. The main thing you do on your phone is to look at the screen and this screen is excellent and you can see it with polarized sunglasses. I also like that you can select dark screen with icons and text lit which saves battery,  If you are on T-Mobile or one of its dedicated MVNOs you might consider this phone. Do your research."
548,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"Me ubiera gustado un poco mÃ¡s grande, muy buen sonido en el carro en todo lo demÃ¡s estÃ¡ muy bien quede satisfecho gracias"
549,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,Excellent
550,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"The Nord N20 5G is speedy. Looks good. And has a very nice camera. You get a headphone jack! An SD Card slot!!. 128GB storage to boot!. And Oxygen OS runs great so far. I get the best signal I have ever gotten. Which is a huge PLUS!. Didi Mao, get yourself a Nord NOW!"
551,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"Update 10-14-2022Still trash, For some unknown reason messages from whatsapp are not showing up at the lock screen. It does not wake the screen either. Sometimes I don't even see the messages looking at the screen. No pop ups. I checked all notifications settings including lockscreen settings to show all info and nothing man this phone is so trash. Better off buying the n10, I updated this review from 3 stars to 1. How the hell did oneplus f up this phone.Very disappointed with the downgrade from oneplus. Most apps I used on the Nord n10 don't fit the screen anynore, I can't see the time stamp on youtube shorts because it doesn't fit to screen. When you get a whapsapp message you can't reply from the notification bar because it doesn't fit you cant even see what you are typing can click send. I don't recommend this phone to anyone, you are better off getting the N200. Also the keyboard is lifted from the bottom of the screen and sometimes you can't see where you are typing. Overall 2.5 out of 5. The screen sucks."
552,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"I bought these to replace 2 year old Moto G Powers (2020 model), which were fairly nice phones. These are much nicer and my triplet boys are very happy with them. They play games better, the fingerprint reader works way better than the one on my Google Pixel 6 Pro (which isn't saying much, sadly). They do come with some crapware, which is annoying and I have no idea why that's legal for an unlocked phone. I didn't realize they had NFC, which was a nice bonus. One weird thing with the google family plan I haven't figured out yet is that they don't update the location very well. Probably a permissions issue."
553,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,Fast delivery and received my phone as described
554,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"The battery is amazing and last so long, also the pictures come out great, love the camera, so far it's been about a week, and I really love it"
555,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,Muy bueno se los recomiendo
556,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"This phone is amazing for the price I paid. I needed to get an upgrade for my father in laws Moto Z3 Play. This thing is an actual â€œupgradeâ€ that doesnâ€™t break the bank. He uses Cricket Wireless which means no 5g but gets solid 4g coverage. Super fast, just seems to work.I bought him a Galaxy A53 5g and that things Bluetooth didnâ€™t work in his car! A quick Google search revealed itâ€™s a common problem with no known fix going back months. Thank heavens for amazons return policy and no restocking bull crap that companies like Best Buy try to pull. Will update if The phone has issues."
557,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"So, I upgraded from OnePlus 7 Pro.A great phone BTW. Upgraded to Nord N 20 5G, pro's and consPro's,Great batteryGreat cell service connection, from my previous phone above.ConsOk Camera, however the older phone has much better camera.Slower phone tooSpace okSo if you are looking for Camera or speed, stay away,But if you just need great battery and connection go for it.And the price is great, I bought it during sale from Amazon."
558,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"I absolutely love this phone. It's responsive and has a lot of great features that my previous phone didn't have. I got almost two full days on one battery charge. Pictures and camera are far better than the Samsung flip that this was replacing. Unfortunately, while it will work with AT&T for calls and text, it will not work for data. Apps will only work on Wi-Fi.  If you only use apps while on Wi-Fi then I can't recommend this phone enough. But if you want to stream your music in your car or use apps like Waze and you have AT&T, forget it."
559,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,El telÃ©fono funciona muy bien. La baterÃ­a rinde mÃ¡s de 2 dÃ­as sin cargar. Se carga en 1 hora aproximadamente de 0 a 100. Tiene cobertura 5g en todas partes con la red de Mint Mobile (T-Mobile). Funciona bien en juegos y no se calienta. La pantalla de se bien en todas condiciones y usando el modo oscuro. A pesar de todo eso lo tuve que devolver ya que le saliÃ³ un punto de pixel muertos en la pantalla. QuizÃ¡s sea un defecto de la unidad que comprÃ©. Por eso las 3 estrellas.
560,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"This is a decent phone. However, the loading time for the home screen is atrocious. It takes like 5-6 seconds to load and I've only used it for a month. And the seller is amazon. Weird."
561,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"This is a super solid phone that punches above it's weight class.Pros:The best battery life I've seen in a phone. Definitely a 2 day phone.Beautiful screen.Build quality feels like a phone at least twice the price in the hands.Fingerprint reader is quick and accurate.Smooth and snappy, never felt sluggish.33w fast charging is super quick.Cons:No fast refresh screen.Only Android 11.Cameras are fine for it's price, but this is where it shows it's price.Overall a super solid phone. Danielstechstudio has a more in depth review on you tube, but this is my go to recommendation if you're looking for the best budget phone out right now. Also very surprising that this is so good, seeing as the Nord n200 from last year was horrible."
562,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"Use this phone for couple days. The experience is not very good.There is no reason to crash twice,It's not because the phone is too hot to crash.The normal use of mobile phones also frequently appears stuck. The power consumption of the battery is average, similar to my iPhone12.You get what you pay for, so you don't need to expect too much for a mobile phone at this price."
563,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"Looks like a great phone and it is advertised as Unlocked, which to me, meant I could take it to any carrier. WRONG! As of this writing, this phone will not work on Verizon."
564,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"I was really liking this phone, but lately it has been freezing, which makes me have to restart it every time it happens. I just might send it back while I can."
565,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"I ran with the Nord N10 for 2 years before wanting an upgrade. I compared this phone to the Samsung A53, and for $50 more than the Nord N20 you get a while lot more, including:-120 Hz display (Nord N20 is 60Hz)-5000 Ma battery life (Nord N20 has 4500 Ma)-5G on AT&T (Nord N20 does not support it)-Android 12 (Nord N20 has 11, at the time of writing this there is no date for upgrade)-Better camera configuration and picture quality (One Plus cuts corners here massively)There are a few other negatives to this phone, but honestly other than the inscreen fingerprint reader, felt like a clone to the N10. Honestly expected much more from One Plus."
566,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"amazing, I think so far the best phone I have ever had. It look nice, its stylish, feels good in the hand, nice weight to it. 10/10 would buy again and I would most defentilly recomend this to my friends and family."
567,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"Perfecto para mÃ­ uso diario, gran capacidad para fotos y buena cÃ¡mara"
568,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"Phone was in a protective case and i was sitting in a chair low to the ground when i dropped this 2 month old phone while taking it out of my pocket. The touch screen and lcd broke after about a 2-3 foot drop onto the floor. A drop my old phone (moto g6) had survived hundreds if not thousands of times. The glass on the n20 didn't even crack or shatter it was such a light fall, but now I have dead lcd lines and a broken digitizer that prevents the touch screen from accepting any inputs. What's worse is that usually budget phone replacement parts are cheaper than on flagship models, but not this phone. My local repair store Quoted me $230 to replace the screen and didgitizer. When I bought the phone brand new for $250. I thought they might be upcharging me but i the lowest repair quote i could find was for $200. Then i thought if i can find the parts maybe I'll do replace it myself, but this phones screen is too expensive. The cheapest i could find the screen and didgitizer was $130. where the oneplus n10 screens and n200 screens are $40-$50. This is poor internal build quality. It was not a hard drop at all and again it was in a solid protective case.I bought this phone because it looked like a good value for the money. It has a decent processor good amount of RAM and memory, and ran well, but I REGRET BUYING THIS PHONE. IT IS FRAGILE AND COSTS TOO MUCH MONEY TO REPAIR.I've been a budget phone user for years and I understand that part of the budget is materials that aren't as fancy My last phone (a moto g6 which lasted almost 4 years and thousands of drops before breaking the charge port). But this phone is not just cheaper materials. Its a cheap design that is waiting to break as soon as it has it's first run in with gravity.If i get a chance I'll post a quick video this trash phone so noone can accuse me of veing a bot for the competition."
569,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,In my case I am facing some issues with Bluetooth system sound when I calling via what's app . It is disconnecting every time while in a video call in what's app. But for music it's working fine.
570,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,Excellent 5G under budget. Decent camera and overall good functionality!
571,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"Decent build. Basic camera function, donâ€™t expect great photos with this cheap phone. It starts to lag when running multiple streaming apps.This phone came unlocked with one Sim card slot. Memory can be expanded with a microSD card.The screen is pretty sharp nice viewing angles and the fingerprint scanner is pretty fast. This phone also comes with face unlock but it doesnâ€™t work for apps. Good alternative to Samsung phones."
572,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,King for budget phones
573,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,Happy
574,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,Solid phone for the priceBut the screen is the main buying point for the price.Extremely color accurate and bright
575,OnePlus,Nord N20,128 GB,OxygenOS,6.43 Inches,"OnePlus n20 5g is Very good budget phone, I bought this phone as a gift to my father, replacd his iphone 8+pro,he likes this phone.everything is easy and smooth"
576,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"I love the light weight and smaller form factor compared to most modern phones. Setup was easy, switching from Android was not difficult. Mine arrived with 93% battery health, quite good for an older device, though the device also arrived without any charge at all, so donâ€™t plan to use it immediately. The speaker is not good and drains your battery quite substantially. The device physically shakes at high volumes; this phone is best used with headphones for music and video consumption. The device is fast, the screen is quite crisp, and the fingerprint reader is very reliable. The device also came with very little bloatware, and unlike with Android, you can uninstall almost everything rather than just disabling the apps.My impression of the phone is quite favorable, though some of Appleâ€™s choices with their software are just a bit silly. The settings for some apps arenâ€™t as granular as they are on Android. If you donâ€™t wholly live in Appleâ€™s ecosystem and consume technology exactly as they think you should, there will be a bit of a learning curve. Thatâ€™s more an issue with the current status of the software across all Apple devices than an issue with this phone specifically and there are ways to adapt to and work around it."
577,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,The phone (refurbished) seems to be working fine.  Itâ€™s only been a few weeks but so far so good.  My only issue was I ordered a 256 & received a 128 mb.  I have the two TB in the cloud but you still canâ€™t really do as much once ur phone or tablet is full so this was important to me but the company offered me a full refund if I wanted to ship back or a partial refund to keep the latter.  I opted for that because I didnâ€™t feel like waiting and setting everything up again. They issued me the partial refund I selected within hours.  No 5-7 business days nonsense so Iâ€™d recommend this company Joygoods and their commitment to responsiveness if shopping for a refurbished iPhone or the like. The model doesnâ€™t come with face recognition but the home button works for fingerprint print unlike many refurbs (particularly in this price range) so yeah they were solid.  The battery health was also at 93% which is stellar for a refurbished phone. ğŸ‘ŠğŸ¼â¤ï¸ğŸ‘
578,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"I previously purchased from Amazon Renewed an iPhone 5s, and was satisfied with it considering the price was barely over one hundred dollars. That phone, however, was originally released in 2013, and at 8 years old it was getting hard to justify its continued use.So when the new iPhone SE (2020) was released I was really tempted to get it, but the pandemic had basically stopped any purchasing of anything for me at the time. Now in September of 2021, with the battery in my old phone failing, it was time to do something.I decided to check out what Amazon might have in their ""renewed"" products and was surprised to find that they now have ""Renewed Premium"", which offers a year's satisfaction guarantee. That meant, in my mind, I could send this thing back if it wasn't good or turned out to be a lemon, so I sprung for it.First of all, this one came in a nice box, oversized, and obviously sturdy enough to protect everything inside. It comes with an information packet describing what ""premium"" means, along with a quick start guide. The inclusion of a standard wall charger was nice, but I have a number of chargers already, not to mention my iPad Pro charger. I'll get back to that in a minute.Another thing that was nice to have included was a tool for removing the SIM card tray. Nice, but it turns out that with the new iPhone SE you can use eSIM! More on that as well in a minute.Now first of all...  This phone looks gorgeous. The red color and the black front make for an awesome combination. All surfaces are smooth as if it was a brand new phone. Turning it on shows the screen is working perfectly, with even back lighting all across to each corner.The first thing I checked was the ""battery health"". Amazon promises that with their renewed premium phones the battery would at least be at ninety percent of capacity, so I immediately checked.Ninety-eight percent! Eight percent better than what they promised. Not bad at all!So it turns out that this phone supports fast charging. So that means my phone gets charged on the desk where my iPad Pro sits, because the charger for that is a high capacity charger. The iPhone SE charges up easily in a little over an hour, which means no need to plug it in over night. In fact, I plug it in before bed, but it's plugged into an outlet controlled by Alexa and that wont come on till in the morning. The phone charges up to capacity before I go to work!Now for setting up the service, the iPhone SE (2020) supports eSIM, which means getting set up with Mint Mobile (or any service that supports eSIM) was as easy as...  Well, I went to Mint Mobile's website, checked my location, checked phone compatibility, chose my service plan, then chose eSIM at check out. A few minutes later a QR code appeared on the screen of my computer that I scanned with the iPhone SE, and a few seconds later I had 4G/LTE and everything ready to go.eSIM is the way to go. It is, just trust me on that.After about a week of using the phone, on some days like I normally do and on other day literally trying to cause it run dry of battery or trying to get it to malfunction, this little phone is holding up way better than I could have anticipated. I believe I can safely say my iPhone 5s can be retired for good.By the way. Get a cover. This phone has a glass back, which means it can be charged wirelessly, but it also means you can break it easily. I got a simple transparent back cover with a raised bezel around the edges. It cost about 9 dollars, came in the same day as the phone.I would recommend this phone and the Amazon Renewed Premium program. Yes the cost of the phone was more than it would have been with renewed only, but being able to return the phone for up to a year is worth it."
579,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,I originally had the iPhone SE 2nd Generation but dropped it one too many times. Bought this as a replacement because I like small phones and this is the smallest out of all the iPhones on the market. I bought the excellent condition iPhone and it brand new. No scratches on screen or anywhere else. Came with charger and instructions on what to do so that you donâ€™t mess up your SIM card. All I had to do was put my SIM card in and power on the phone and it worked perfectly. I give this seller 5 stars because itâ€™s like brand new and itâ€™s unlocked so I can use any service provider.
580,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,Battery life according to the battery health settings menu says more that 90%. Thatâ€™s pretty good for a phone that is 2 years old. THIS IS THE 2nd GEN SE NOT THE 3 GEN. There is no 5g capabilities. But maybe that is what makes the battery last longer. Phone came in perfect condition. I think there were a few tiny scrapes around the camera housing but all glass were unmarked.
581,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"I have an iPod 6th generation and after reviewing comments, many had mentioned the 7th generation was the last.  Some suggested to buy an unlocked iPhone to transfer the files.  I have, and the iPhone is fantastic.  The battery life is longer, and I can upload the most current IOS version on this phone. Thank you so much for this item, I can enjoy my music."
582,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"I bought one red and one black for my kids, who are 11 and 9, to use on Wi-Fi. Both are amazing quality and not a single scratch! They do come in simple packages and are supplied with Amazon brand cords and plugs, however we have so many lighting cords here from other apple products thatâ€™s not an issue at all. These will be Christmas gifts, so I canâ€™t comment on how well they work/hold up, but I have a feeling there will be no issues. I am glad I went with the refurbished."
583,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,Had old I phone 6.  Battery life very short.  Dropping calls etc.  Purchased I Phone SE 2cd for $171. and so far after one week has been perfect.  Easier to switch just inserted sim card from old I Phone and followed set up instructions on phone.  It was a snap for this Senior Citizen.
584,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,I ordered this phone because my old iPhone SE had a cracked screen and poor battery life. It was cheaper for me to buy this phone rather than fix my old phone. Phone arrived early. Itâ€™s in excellent condition. Not a scratch on it. Battery health is 93%. Easy setup. Very satisfied.
585,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"86% battery life, so not as good as some here, but still pretty good. Mom will be the (very light) user of this phone so that will be just fine. Couldn't tell it wasn't new except for the battery capacity! No scratches or anything. Shocked and satisfied. Activated unlocked phone on mint mobile no problem."
586,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"This is the first time that I purchased Amazon renewed cellphone. I usually bought my iPhone through my cellphone provider. I received the phone one day early as expected shipping delivery. I charged the phone with fully 100% battery within 3 hours. The battery lasted more than 15 hours on stand by, and more than 9 hours on talks, texts, browsing etc. Overall, itâ€™s a good quality. It feels like a brand iPhone."
587,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"Got this new-to-me refurbished iPhone SE (2020), and it is top notch quality, no scratches, no problems with the charge, no problems at allâ€”it might as well be brand new.Basically, I got what I ordered and it's very good quality. With used electronics, that's success."
588,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"Iâ€™m an old guy, I like old school so this phone is perfect for me. Had an SE before, this on has bigger screen, bigger buttons for txting, long battery life. It was a good purchase for me I donâ€™t use lots of apps and this phone is perfect."
589,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"I love the phone and the quality of the phone far exceeds expectation. However I received a phone that has a battery that needs replaced and states it is in significant degrade, I messaged the seller to see what we can do about this just waiting for a reply."
590,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,Could not get phone to setup out of the box. Erased everything and loaded newest version of the operating system. Phone went through setup correctly and loaded data from an existing backup. Phone has worked correctly for a week. Transferred existing SIM card and all functions work correctly.
591,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"El producto es excelente, estÃ¡ como nuevo y sirven todas sus funciones, a los usuarios que compran o deseen comprar productos renewed les recomiendo elegir la mejor calidad del mismo, hay personas que usan un celular nuevo por unas semanas o pocos meses y lo devuelven por diferentes motivos, no solo porque estÃ©n daÃ±ados"
592,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"I got this phone for my grandpa and i works great. We had a battery issue but the seller was fast to respond and very cooperative, we got a new battery."
593,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"I bought the phone and it arrived in good, not excellent condition, although when buying I chose the category with excellent condition  not the category with good condition.There are no scratches, but the screen protection was not installed well, as there are some air bubbles below it, and the battery capacity was 83%But the mobile works perfectly, the camera and the speakersThis evaluation is during a one-week use"
594,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"I had an excellent experience with the seller, and the device came in perfect condition. The rest of this review will be about the device itself rather than my experience purchasing it refurbished.The GoodThe A13 processor punches far above its weight and compares favorably with the best premium Android processors. This performance level in a phone at this price is rediculous. There is no better deal for performance per dollar.With the high end chip, you're also getting camera smarts well above what a single lens shooter should be capable of achieving. While not beating the cheaper Pixel 3a with its multi lens design and Google algorithms, do not underestimate this single camera and brains combination.The phone feels premium and is extremely lightweight still. Wireless charging and Wi-Fi 6 are bonuses that we typically don't see in this part of the market.Apple will support this device for many years to come, exceeding many competitors.The BadThe biggest limitation of this phone is the small battery design that hasn't been updated in years. It's the same as the iPhone 8 aside from the upgrades to the internals. This means you're getting iPhone 8 battery life. Unless you are a light user, you'll need to top up the charge before the day is through when combined with that A13 engine. This is like a sports car with a tiny gas tank. Other phones in the segment have nearly double the battery capacity, and the super fast A13 gives you ample opportunity to spend it.That dated design brings with it a small LCD screen when most of the world has moved on to LED technology. While the screen is one of the best given the technology in use, the display technology is obsolete. The display is objectively less color accurate and less sharp the newer display technology. With that said, it's still a pretty good display even if the blacks could be darker. It is the best you can get if you don't mind the older technology class.Summary: Insanely powerful engine strapped to a tiny battery wrapped up in yesterday's package.I would recommend this for light to moderate users who often have access to charging during the day, and anyone who wants to get into the Apple world at a low price point.I would not recommend this device to someone who plans to use it for watching HD videos, plays games for long periods while traveling, or is usually far away from an outlet. I think this person would prefer a device with a more up-to-date display and better battery capacity."
595,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,Strictly game or movie phone for 6 year old. Highly restricted. Internet only.
596,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,The batteries life was above what I expected. The touch sensitivity is fast and the screen came almost flawless
597,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"Best deal for an iPhone SE. Make sure you buy in â€œExcellentâ€ condition. I tried a â€œGoodâ€ one and had bad results. This one has been flawless and came with 98% battery life!! Only complaint is for the iPhone SE, there are absolutely no screen protectors anywhere on the market that fit perfectly. Other than that, itâ€™s a great phone."
598,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"OK, OK, I should have reworded the headline, but it is her phone and she is satisfied with it. Everything worked as advertised. The physical appearance is like new, it ported properly and everything loaded without problems."
599,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"With the crazy stupid costs of new phones and all the people that think it is smart to pay for them over two years that almost pay double, there is no other way than to buy refurb. It doesn't quite charge to 100% which was already stated in the description, but works as it should. Good quality, fast shipping, easy set up."
600,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,Looks new. Battery life was 83% but it seems to last all day with moderate use. Iâ€™ve been using it for a couple months without problems.
601,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,The phone was put in a protective case right away and when I got my phone set up  and updated I realized the back camera wasnâ€™t working all the time on any app that used it. Would restart phone and it worked but then it became more frequent so I updated it again and it didnâ€™t fix the camera problem nor the flashlight not working. WASTE. OF MY. MONEY.
602,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"The phone looks good and functions well.  However, I purchased a phone termed in ""excellent"" condition, and the battery capacity is only 82%--far lower than the same model phone I've had for over a year."
603,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"Hi - wanted an inexpensive, but not low-end, replacement iPhone for my son.  This phone was a great price and looked brand new.  There wasn't a scratch on it and battery life was estimated at 95%.  I couldn't be more pleased with it.  Thanks again and hope to do business with you again as soon as my wife and other son need replacement phones."
604,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"I received the Iphone SE within a few days of ordering. I checked all functions of the phone thoroughly and could not find a single issue. Cosmetically the phone is in perfect condition, all features of the phone work great. The phone was carrier unlocked as promised and had a 94% battery life. This is a great value for those who cannot afford a new iphone. I will be ordering from this seller again!"
605,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,They advertised excellent condition and that is what I got 5 stars â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸
606,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,Phone looked good and seems to work good but came with some slight scratches on face.
607,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,This renewed phone is perfect.I can not see a mark scratch or any thing that would say it was not brand new. Very happy with this purchase.
608,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"I bought this to replace my iphone  7 which would no longer work with my Apple watch. Although used, it looked like new. I did not have to contact my carrier (Tracfone). I just transfered the simm, tranfered the software and I was good to go within a few minutes."
609,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"Great condition. Battery was at maximum performance of 82%. Nonetheless, excellent deal for the price. Especially, since this phone was not available on Apple Store anymore. Highly recommended Amazon Renewed."
610,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,No other problems. Battery at 86% health
611,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,Phone was delivered fast and in good condition. Works perfectly.
612,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"I previously had the original version of the SE. This version is an impressive improvement. The screen is slightly bigger, easier to navigate, I can activate the phone easily with my thumbprint, it is faster, and the battery charge lasts longer. The sound quality during phone calls is also clearer. The battery was at 89%, which is acceptable.It took some trial and error to transfer data from my old phone, but transferring the SIM card was easy.For the money, this phone is a bargain."

614,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,I really appreciate the speed in which it was delivered (one day) and I had it set up by that evening with cell service! Highly recommend this seller! Completely affordable!
615,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"I am not someone who needs latest/greatest anything but I want quality and function. This phone came in excellent shape, not a blemish anywhere. The battery life was at 96% as promised. The function is excellent. AND....... I'm not on the hook for a thousand dollars like I would be if I had to buy a new iPhone. I was so impressed, I bought another phone for my mother. We are both thrilled and I will look to this seller in the future should I ever need another phone. If you are in need of a quality, low price, used iPhone, truly look no further than this seller. Buy with confidence."
616,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,Got this for my grandsonâ€¦he loves itâ€¦plays games â€¦Snapchat â€¦no problems so far and had it for 3 months now
617,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,Purchased this when my son lost his iPhone 12 Mini. It works great. Had no physical or technical defects. Battery life was great. For $150â€¦ Iâ€™m happy!
618,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,Muy bueno
619,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"Wife and kids insist on using iPhones. They are complete junk compared to my Samsung Android. Batteries are terrible, picture quality is mediocre, and signal strength and dropped service is a constant battle. If you're undecided on which platform, I highly recommend avoiding Apple and iOS."
620,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"I was skeptical of buying previously owned (same with cars). But this was such a easy, seamless & efficient process that I am now a believer. The supplier & Amazon kept their word on everything; phone arrived as promised, phone condition as promised = excellent, battery health as promised (over 80% = 82%. No problems transferring by Verizon or iCloud. Will certainly do it again. Well done by everyone!"
621,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"It arrived a day or so earlier, which I appreciate, but it came in a plain humble box, so ordinary I thought it was the case! Not in an Amazon Renewed box which I'd seen in some other reviews. The charger and cable are not original, but it was to be expected. I've been using the phone for a few days now, and so far no issues; it works great, like new, with no glitches whatsoever. The battery's health is a bit of a letdown because it's only 87% - yes, I read the description, but I suppose I'd hoped that it'd be about 90% because the price was a little higher than what was offered by another website, so I kinda hoped it'd been in a like-new condition. But anyway, nothing to complain really, and I got the benefits of saving a couple of hundred dollars and doing a little good deed for the environment (or maybe barely LOL). If you're considering whether to buy a refurbished iPhone, I'd say go for it."
622,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,Great
623,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,My old phone was acting up. This one is in amazing condition for a used phone.
624,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,This is my second renewed phone. It looks new and operates perfectly in all ways.(I didnâ€™t rate face recognition because I donâ€™t use it.)
625,Apple,IPhone SE,64 GB,IOS 15,4.7 Inches,"While description claimed it would work with all carriers, this phone was NOT compatible with AT&T, where we had planned on using it.  Battery went down very fast for not even using the phone."
626,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I just set up my Moto G Stylus 5G (2021) phone and successfully transferred my Tracfone account into it. The important factor to be aware of is that TracFone is owned by Verizon now, so it's my understanding that only Verizon will be used as the carrier for TracFone service. So make sure that you purchase the Verizon version of the $5 ""Bring your own phone"" sim card kit if you intend to do the same.  This unlocked phone is compatible with TracFone because it supports the necessary CDMA and LTE specifications. When you get your sim card kit, it comes on a small credit card sized plastic sheet. Simply break the seams on the card until you have the smallest form factor (nano) and have it ready...I calledTracfone Customer Service and the representative guided me through the whole process, including testing the phone's abilities to make and receive calls and text messages. I'm really happy with my purchase!  Some other important details - this phone has limitations on the power level of the charger that can be used, so it's very important to use the factory charger so it doesn't overload the system.  Also, you may be wondering if it's worth paying $100 more for the 2022 version of the Moto G Stylus 5G based on it's better screen and 120hz refresh rate. Of course that's a great improvement. but the 60hz screen on this phone looks fine and the newer 120hz specification uses more battery power. Based on that, I actually like the fact that this phone's battery might last longer on a full charge.  And finally, while going through the frustrations of choosing a protective case, I searched for a long time to find a slim, textured, hard plastic one that was similar to the case that I'd been using for a few years. So I settled on one that seemed very similar....I was thrilled and surprised to find out that the one I ordered is a genunine factory Motorola accessory!  Here's the exact title of the Amazon listing - I chose the blue-gray version, which is just perfect...it's a medium gray color, contrary to what one reviewer states on that listing. There are certainly some cases that offer better protection, but this one is a pleasure to use...the phone fits comfortably in the pocket of my jeans. It's a really beautiful acessory for this phone!Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2021) Protective Case- Precision fit Shock Absorbing Cases for Enhanced Phone Grip, Style, Drop Protection [NOT for G Stylus 2020, G Stylus 2021] Grey Blue"
627,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"My Moto Z4 was reaching the end of its useful life, mostly due to an ever shorter battery life.  I've had this phone for nearly 4 years, and it replaced the original Moto Z.  As you might surmise, I like the Moto line of phones.My criteria for a new phone was simple:1. Must have +6GB RAM2. Must have +128GB of internal storage3. Must have micro SD storage capability4. Must have excellent battery capacity5. Must have earphone jack6. Must have a decent processor7. Must have Android no more than on version old.8. Must be OEM unlocked for the USA9. Must not require a second mortgage to purchase.10. Must be 5G capable.With the plethora of phones out on the market, you'd think there would be countless options...but no, there aren't.  The one phone I kept coming back to during my months long research was the Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G.I finally pulled the trigger a week ago and, after seven days of real world use, I have to say that I am impressed and pleased.  The phone runs smoothly and performs all of the needed tasks I need throughout the day: email, texting web searches, phone calls and maybe some twittering along the way.I've noticed only a few stutters along the way, when I've had 20 web pages loaded in Chrome, for instance and constantly switching from one tab to another.  The processor on this phone is a Snapdragon 750G, which is very capable but, like any thing, if you overload it, it may show some slight stutter when scrolling, but it has been rare and not really an issue for me.Now...the battery.  Impressive!  I use the phone most heavily in the morning as I begin my day.  I'm up at 7 a.m. and by noon I was at 78% capacity.  by the time I plugged in at around 9 p.m. I still had almost 50%.Now, if you're streaming youtube videos, etc., you can expect a more rapid drain, but the battery in this phone is as large as anything you'll find in any other phone on the market.The phone size is surprisingly sleek, with a screen almost a 1/2"" taller than my Moto Z4.  Android 12 presents a learning curve, having come from Android 10, but I'm getting used to it and I'm sure in another week or so it will be second nature.  Motorola keeps its Android branch as close to stock as you can get.  The Moto gestures are a huge benefit that I've come to rely on over the years, so I'm glad I found a phone in the Moto line.I was skeptical about the whole stylus feature and, to be honest, I've not had the need to use it so far.  I've played with it and it's easy and intuitive to use.  I can foresee a time when I'll need to write a quick note, and this is ultimately better than searching for a pen and scrap of paper that you might wind up losing.  It's totally unobtrusive, but it's there if you need it and easily accessible.  I view this as more of an added feature that I'll be happy to have when needed, but out of the way.I like this phone so much I'm going to purchase another one for my wife. I've tried it with both T-Mobile and Verizon sim cards and the phone is right at home with either service.Motorola has hit the nail on the head for performance, features, and affordability.  I hope Motorola continues developing and producing phones like this.  I'll remain a loyal customer if they do, and will recommend this particular phone for anyone asking ""What is the best, affordable phone on the market.""!"
628,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I bought this 6MB unlocked Motorola phone when I was forced to get a new phone because of the network change.This phone has the most storage I could find and I love that it had six megabytes of RAM and the stylus. I also love that it was unlocked.Compared to other sellers, the price was pretty good. I like the idea of going with a different carrier then boost because I knew I could get a better price per month.That being said I want up returning this phone unused because boost offered me a free phone that only cost me $82. :DSo it's the same version of the phone but it is locked to boost it's only four megabytes of RAM and it's half the memory built in. That's unfortunate because internal memory seems to be what I need most.But with tax this phone would have cost me $370 vs $82 and the store threw in a free case and screen protector to help offset the cost.But I love the phone I got even with its four megabytes of RAM. The screen is crisp and clear it's a nice size in my hand and the screen size is very good. I love having the stylist it takes an SD card which is also a deal breaker I had to have that. I think sound is good I don't have to use an external speaker if it's not convenient. I enjoy watching TV shows on Amazon prime and YouTube videos. I like the gesture features I really like being able to shake the phone twice to turn on my flashlight and I like being able to use three fingers to take a screenshot. I can't completely judge the camera because I haven't read all the instructions yet about how to use it. Also I haven't printed anything out. As far as the camera goes taking a picture with your phone from your pocket and having the picture on your phone I think it's just fine but I never had a problem or a gripe with any phone camera. As far as I can tell it does not have a music player I did download one but I couldn't get it to work after the first time. I have not yet fiddled with that again since.Unfortunately I can't attest to whether the unlocked on this phone works because I never used that. But as far as having a phone that's quick and responsive and looks and feels good having a nice size screen clear bright good sound quality having the stylus there if you want it, I like the way it organizes the apps. It also still has an actual headphone jack which I like having there in case I want it even though I just did buy new Bluetooth headphones and they work well with this phone. It also synchronizes fine with my car for phone calls.I have just recently noticed some trouble doing things on the phone that I thought I could do before and now I have to use my computer to do them I don't know if this is something weird going on with the phone or the internet or what? I don't want to blame it on the phone if it is not the phone's fault but I also wanted to mention it in case it is a problem and you wonder why I didn't say so.I think if you get this phone you will like it. I would prefer this version here on Amazon to the one I have because of the more RAM and more storage. But as far as actual features and functions of the phone I think it's great."
629,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I purchased the dark green g stylus 2021, returned it.  Bought several Samsungs,  but the final purchase that I am very happy with is the seafoam green G Stylus 2022, which is the phone in above pictures.  I used Moto Z force with mods for years, recently tried a miriad of phones wanting largest battery possible, stylus, expandable memory, headphone jack. Tried Samsung Note 10+, Note 20 ultra, Moto G Stylus 5g 2021 to name a few. Really liked the G Stylus, but the processor seemed a little slow. Samsungs worked great, but I was more partial to G Stylus even with lacking speed. Then the G Stylus 2022 launched with a better processor and refresh rate, Excellent!  The camera seems to be a step down from the 2021 G Stylus, Samsung has incredible zoom ability but unlike G Stylus there's no macro-- which I use often to view small electronics, boards, even fine print!(why do they continue printing labels smaller and smaller! Lol). I love the Motorola stylus over Samsung stylus, much more comfortable not feeling like a kindergarten crayon. No, it doesn't have the Samsung stylus air features, but the only feature I found useful was camera shutter.I wished the G Stylus had a faster charging rate, and wireless would be nice.Working out in the field for extended time I missed the moto mod battery pack. Here is the fix for that.There is no battery case built for the G Stylus, but ironically the Samsung Note 20 ultra has very close to the same dimensions and button layout.  The main difference is the G Stylus is several millimeters taller.  I found that a few seconds with a heat gun (could probably even use a hair dryer) allowed stretching of the top to fit perfectly.  Reheat will shrink case back to original size, so after heating you must keep it stretched until it cools a bit.  I cut 2 paint paddles a hair larger than the phone to help the persuasion. The mic hole will need to be made, drilling works but a leather hole puncher is cleaner. Same for stylus and headphone hole. Took me about 20 minutes to redesign, but gained a large battery with easy to hold case, and wireless charging.  With this the need for rapid charge like the moto edge isn't as necessary.I am super happy with the 5g Moto G Stylus 2022, even above the Note 20 ultra!"
630,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"No complaints, everything seems fine. With video contrast (or brightness) at maximum, I found that a 28-minute video on Netflix drained 10%. That means about 21% for a full hour, 42% for two hours; 84% for four hours, with enough charge left for another half-hour video at max brightness. Picture quality is fine, not stupendous like some $1500 OLED TV.  Four camera lenses at the back! And a lot of options that it's best to query Youtube and other online info on. You can shake it twice to turn on the flashlight; shake twice again to turn it off. Twist your wrist twice to open the camera; Let's Twist Again to shut it off. You'll have to explore ""Options"" either on the phone or online to set these up, but they were not difficult for a tech-challenged person like me. Those are the only two gestures I need. Yes, fingerprint support; I just use a pin code. I don't live in my phone like most people; a PC is my go-to for most things. But for travel, it's basically a good phablet."
631,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I didn't have a cell phone until I joined a search and rescue unit.  I bought this for it's big battery, and it has shown to keep it's charge well.  My phone can sit by the door for 3 weeks, and when I turn it on, it has a very nearly full charge.  I turn it on to make a call, keep it on for replies or call-backs. and then I turn it off.  No games, no social media, no play... as a work phone it is great."
632,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I so wanted to like this phone.  But there is something wrong with it.  I can not really tell if it is fully defective or just a super crappy phone.  This is my 4th Moto.  I buy them for the cost and because I do not want to deal with a lot of unremovable ""bloatware"" (I'm talking to you Samsung).  Every Moto Phone I have had except the E5 Play with removable battery has had battery problems. The Charging Tech is junk. The Batteries have all swelled up about 18 months.  My 7 year old LG... never a battery issue.  So let me tell you about the Pros of this Phone.  #1 There are not Pros  Cons - yep.  Plenty of cons.  It's too tall and narrow... it is very slippery and uncomfortable to hold.  The screen is mediocre.  And the haptics are ""off"".  I can be holding it and just barely shift position and the screen with jump back.  It feels way too sensitive.  Conversely my G7+ which this replaced because of the swelled battery does not have this problem.  It's not super comfortable but actually a lot better than this.  And the Screen appears sharper.  The signal reception on this phone is TERRIBLE!!!  I get -119db, but when I pop the sim into my 7 year old LG I get -85db.  It's a massive difference.  Lets talk 5G.  My 5G reception is aweful and seems to be even slower than the 4LTE.  And because of the poor signal the phone is constantly hopping one to the other.  And I can see no way to just pick one of them and hafe it stick.  The battery life seems okay.  I have not bothered to update to Android 12 because I am probably going to have to return this.  Again I am not sure if it is defective or just really this bad.  Its the worse Moto phone (and also the most expensive) that I have ever purchased.  The midrange Moto Cameras are all paper specs and no performance.  Again my 7 year old LG just blows this out of the water... the images are flat dull and boring in comarison. And the focus is slow.  I didn't really buy it for the camera and would probably never use it anyways.  But why these companies pushing these rediculous specs on paper when they are using sensors about the size of a pencil eraser?  And why do I need/want 4 cameras.  Just put one basic decent 12mega pixel camera on it and be done. At this price range the cameras are all crap so why put 4 crap lens on when 1 will suffice.  Oh and the stylus.  Yikes.  Not useful to me at all.  So I bought this as a G7+ replacement thinking it would be a bit better and a bit faster, but it's not better at all.  It's worse.  Moto is wasting so much energy making so many models all similar but just a little different.  They should just make a couple models and try to make them the best at each price point which brings up another issue.  Pricing is all over the place.  It can vary by $100 or more depending on which day it is and how the wind is blowing.  Hard to tell... so hard to tell which models are supposedly better just by price.  Too many models.  I guess if you like the Green Color then the case plastic is the best thing.  I should have a new sim soon from another company to test if the phone actually has any kind of reception improvement.  I am not keeping my fingers crossed. Will be monitoring closely so I can get this thing returned before I make a mistake and get stuck with this brick.  Ask me how I really feel?  Answer:  So disappointed.  No way this thing is worth $399.  Not even $199.  This is a $79 phone on it's best day.  But hey Moto does have decent version of Android.  Right?"
633,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Love this phone. For a remanufactured product, this phone looks and works like a new phone. The camera takes great pictures even in ow light. The battery lasts for two days, and this phone is fast. Setup was easy, I just took the sim card out of my old phone, popped it in this one and it was ready to go. Shipping was fast. Will definitely buy this again."
634,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"The phone is great in general. I like it a lot. But the fingerprint reader/sensor is the worst I have ever encountered on a phone. The worst!!!! It works only 10% of the time. So I thought I could use the face recognition feature instead. Well, the face recognition feature is a joke. All it has to be is a human face and the phone unlocks. That's so unfortunate for a phone that is quite a good phone for the price."
635,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I love Motorola phones! They're not loaded down with junk apps, they're well made and are every bit as good as the most expensive phones. The colors are vibrant, the camera is really nice, it's fast, long lasting battery, no glitches. Very pleased with this purchase. I took a picture of the box it came in. I purchased it new, not from the warehouse. I do not know what this gross stuff is on the case or where it came from as the box was unopened, but I could puke. It is sticky/wet and it took all I could do to lysol wipe/clean/sanitize it. So So So GROSS!!"
636,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Very nice phone. Great price for all the features. I ğŸ˜ love that it has a headphone jack, it's easy for me to plug my headphones in and not have to worry if I charged them before using them. Very clear screen and high definition camera. Doesn't have a back button, you have to swipe instead. Not too happy about that, I accidentally keep closing my windows. But it's new to me and I'll just need more time to get better acquainted with the phone. I had a Sony Xperia prior and this phone is about 20% longer. Makes it a little tough to put in my pocket. Once again, something I'll need to get use to. I love that it has 256GB of space plus you can use a SD card! ğŸ˜ Lots of space. Overall great phone especially for the price. Would recommend"
637,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I ordered this phone about a month or so ago at this point and I've got a lot of good things to say about it. Having previously used a OnePlus 8T, I can honestly say that I don't notice performance differences between the two devices (I'm not a gamer, so I'm talking about general-use performance; lots of web-browsing, note-taking, basic gaming, photo-taking, YouTube, music, and document editing).The battery on this device is great. It lasts me two days. I think it could run for two and a half days if not 3, depending on how I use my device.The camera is decent. If you're in a poorly-lit environment, forget about it, it's not very good at all, but it takes crisp and nice images outdoors during the day.The screen quality (viewing) is the worst part, as I've literally owned cheaper phones with a crisp AMOLED display no different from my OnePlus 8T.  I suppose to make it affordable, less investment went into the screen quality. It doesn't seem like a 1080p display to me, more like a 720p display. My eyes hurt for a while in the beginning, but they adjusted and now it's fine. I can still tell it's not the best quality, but aside from the screen, I like it no less than my OnePlus 8T and don't really notice any major differences.Call quality will obviously mostly depend on your carrier, but on this phone compared to my 8T, people noticed it is a bit harder to hear me. If 10/10 is the 8T in best call quality, the Moto is about an 8.7/9. You've got to speak a bit louder. Not an issue if you're using Bluetooth or wired earbuds. Maybe it's just the device I got, not all of the devices of this model. No clue, but either way it's fine.The speaker is fine, and it's not too different from my 8T, honestly. Side-by-side, I can tell that my 8T is a bit louder, but the clarity is the same (to me).At this price point, I can't complain. I love this device and hope it lasts me well. If it does, I would totally stick to this series and their newer models. Love the built-in Stylus. Solid build, fast, durable, and lightweight."
638,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Battery life is great, screen feels good looks and works well. The camera worked fine for me (but that's not why I own a phone) I want a phone to work well as a phone...and it does. I am actually getting 5g service in a weak area, the reception is improved from my previous moto g7 power. I am using it with spectrum although they said it was not compatible with their system but it works great...even wifi calling works.For the price it is excellent."
639,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"So been almost 2 weeks using Moto G Stylus 5G | 2021 so it's good Smart Phone everything looks nice & fashionable,love it but I have been having Camera issues not working have to restart everytime & seriously it's so annoying everytime have to restart been doing it 2 to 3 times in a day sometimes & have Software Problem to it freezes & same thing have to restart it .  So this kind of Issue I been having so please  is it Possible that You can Send me Different New Phone Please I have been having some Issues ."
640,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Overall it is a quality phone for the price point.Sometimes it bogs down opening apps, but it isn't a constant issue.It also lacks NFC which most other phones in this class have. Losing the ability to do contactless payment from my phone is an annoyance, but not a deal breaker."
641,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"The 2 day battery lasts only one day. I was really counting on the 2 day battery. Other than that, it is an alright phone."
642,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I have had this phone for about a month. Large screen, has the features that are important to me.  I like the ""gestures"" such as the ability to take a screen shot by touching screen with 3 fingers and opening camera with 2 flicks of the wrist. I also like the stylus which stores inside the phone. This phone is excellent for those with arthritis in their fingers."
643,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Really glad I got this phone. it's lightweight, and easy to handle physically yet has a big screen. It's fast, packed with cool features, and works flawlessly with Android 12. Motorola's customer service and technical support are outstanding. At the $199 price point, it's a no-brainer; this is the one."
644,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I've only have had a few hours but so far it's great. I know the phone is 5G, but I didn't know I would immediately get 5G service. Thought I would still get 4G.Also, I never thought I would love the stylus pen as much as I do. I'm so used to using my finger but I like the pen more.Please don't disappoint, Moto!"
645,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Only issue I have with this phone is that its interface is not very well organized especially when you go to your files. Compared to my previous phone, this one has limited feature to organize my files. Although this doesn't come with bloatware, to keep cost down, it doesn't come with its own music player nor its own photo editing. On the plus side the display size and image quality are great ğŸ‘ You won't be able to tell it's a budget phone."
646,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Me agradÃ³ todo, pero si viniera con el cover y protector de pantalla, mucho mejor."
647,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I LOVE THIS PHONE.Ever since I had an LG Stylo 5 (pretty old, I know), I never wanted to go back to a phone that did not come with a built in stylus. I upgraded to the LG Stylo 6 when it came out and was VERY disappointed. It was so fragile and just... cheap. Then I found out that they discontinued that line completely!So then I did some research and came across the Moto G Stylus. I researched all the different years and whatnot and found out that this 2021 model is BETTER than this years 2022 model! And indeed it is!I have the 256gb version and it does everything I could want or need, besides the NFC reader.It DOES NOT come with the NFC reader, but I have done without it before even when I had it in previous phones so to me, not a big deal.WATER RESISTANCE:I am not sure if I just got lucky or if this phone really does have superior water protection, but I had accidentally drop my phone in boiling hot water for a good 3-5 seconds before pouring the whole liquid+phone into the sink and it STILL WORKED without any glitching with key presses, or screen glitches or anything! Like nothing happened to it! The speaker was just wet and once it dried, it was completely normal. I almost crapped myself by the way when all of this happened because it was the 3rd day after I had gotten it. And until this day, still works like new.Processor/Memory:I have installed a ton of apps on this phone and it still works fast and have plenty of room to go. All this memory allows the phone to function without getting overloaded.It has a HUGE screen and has some weight to the phone. I personally like slightly heavier phones.I like the camera. I've taken some cool pics with them but I am not the type to take a bunch of pictures of anything really but that might change once my baby is delivered.The speaker on the phone comes out of one spot which I believe other models used to have like dual sound or something but it's whatever because I usually listen to things through earbuds.I give this phone a thumbs UP"
648,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Good phone for price, many features, good battery, takes very good photos"
649,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I've used iPhone 5, 6, Pixel 4a, and pixel 6/5G, but I found this Moto G Stylus 5G works just as good - actually better in many ways (e.g., better/bigger screen, better sound, better camera, bluetooth and hot spot smooth connection, etc.). At $200 on Amazon, it's way less than half of the price for the others."
650,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Phone seems fine, never really found out. Tried to use with Spectrum but they say it is not compatible. Even thou Amazo6n says it is unlocked and carrier compatible it is not. Went to Spectrum and they only there phones will work. I believe that is just a scam so you have to buy their phones but nothing I can do about it. Just a warning."
651,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,I would reend this phone. It has a good camera and battery life
652,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Happy with the camera and overall build of the phone. Battery is really good.I don't find any issues hearing others but other has complained many a times that my voice was braking while on a what's app call. That doesn't happen with my other phone while on the same network. So not sure whether it's phone issue or something else.Intially for a month I was not satisfied with this phone and wanted to return it but now I think I am getting used to it.On Facebook , I am still struggling to navigate back if somebody's profile picture is opened and then not seeing a way back."
653,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I bought this phone, making sure to double check that it was UNLOCKED, only for the phone to be locked when I get it. Now I'm fighting with t mobile to get the damn thing unlocked. If I can't I will be returning this phone.*Edit to update: couldn't get the phone unlocked. I am returning that one. Bought another one just to see (because the very first one I bought almost a year ago was UNLOCKED). Got it today and this one is thankfully unlocked.Great phone. Durable. Tons of memory space."
654,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Pleased with this phone for the most part.  Fingerprint reader is weak at best.  The camera has glitched a couple times and caused the phone to freeze.  But, overall, it's been a great purchase."
655,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"After it's fully charged, it will use 15% of the battery overnight. It doesn't have a lot of built in unnecessary software and won't allow you to uninstalled it like some other phone."
656,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I like the big screen of the Moto Stylus 5g, I like the 250 MB of memory, I like the camera's clear pictures, and that it is easy to use.  Some tips about the phone indicate that you can place the screen down on a flat surface so that it would not disturb with calls or notice of messages, but so far this feature is not working in my cellphone.  I gave 3 stars because it is not easy to use.  When I try to use some apps that I don't use frequently, it has a hard time taking me to the ""all apps"" screen.  I drag my finger from bottom to mid screen and it shows a second screen of apps.  I drag my finger again upwards and it goes back to the home screen.  I keep doing this process until it opens the screen with the rest of apps.  When making a call, I need to access another page to find the information that I need at that moment, then it becomes difficult to find the call screen again.  Sometimes I get a call, but there is no calling screen.  I log in while it is ringing, but I can't find the screen to answer the call.  The caller hangs up, but that last call is not registered on the recent calls list.  The phone doesn't come with a voice recorder app.  If you download one from Google, it comes with annoying ads and prompts for you to buy the adds free version."
657,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Great phone, excellent price, arrived on time"
658,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,Too soon to say.
659,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"My whole family bought these. We love the stylus, battery life, screen size, picture clarity and the sound quality.We really do not have any complaints at all.Packaging was fantastic.Phones are sturdy.Screens are crystal clear.The stylus seems to only work on the phone. Did not work on our iPads. (I'm good with this)Great value overall."
660,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Love this phone. Great screen, easy to use, cool stylus feature for taking notes and coloring on your phone. The color of the case is beautiful, and the camera is sharp. Great price for an awesome phone. I would recommend."
661,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Battery life is excellent, I haven't run my battery down yet."
662,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"It wouldn't be a bad phone,but it does have its Glitches.The stylus that came with it the end broke off and I had to get a pair of needle nose pliers to get it out to replace it.Then the screen cracked from falling out of my side pant pocket while sitting in chair.And it did a face plant from maybe two feet from floor.And I have it in a very good protective case ( LeYi Military Grade)with protective screen cover.And it still cracked.And before all that I've been having glitches in downloaded apps and sometimes it just does it own thing when I swipe up to unlock.I've only had since December 8,2021.I still have my cell phones from 10 years ago,So it's not like I don't take good care of them.I may have screen replace,but I'm weighing in if its worth my time and money or just go with a different cell phone all together.I liked the phone until it started acting up and finding the screen is flimsy.I paid $408.07.And within 8 months it doesn't seem to be worth the investment.The color quality of screen was and still is nice and it is functioning.But one more accidental drop will probably make it useless."
663,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I have had a Pixel 3XL since 2017.  Love that phone.  I was super hesitant to switch.  The Pixel 4 and 5 series didn't really impress me, and had no fingerprint reader.  Pixel 6 is pretty expensive, and the fingerprint reader is on the screen.  I know it shouldn't be a deal breaker, but it si, for me.Enter Moto 2021 Stylus.  It's large...a good thing since my eyes aren't getting younger.  It has a vibrant screen.  The fingerprint reader is tre cool and on the back.  Add a great camera, exceptional battery life, and I'm a happy camper.The only downside is the speakers.  Let's face it, Pixel has it down pat.  Moto, meh.  Even so, I would buy this phone again is a trice.  Take the chance.  You'll be happy."
664,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Excelente telefono, cumpe casi con todo y much mas por el precio. Solamente la  bateria para nada dura 2 dias, solamente uno, como todos los telefonos, algunas funciones no se pueden modificar, como el encendido de pantalla cada pocos segundos"
665,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"It's a very good value with no missing functionality that I needed. The 256GB storage is huge, I can use it to capture video all day long.There is one major issue: WIFI calling does not work at all.  When it's WIFI calling is enabled, the other party doesn't hear me or vice versa. I have to disable WIFI calling and live with the spot mobile coverage in the house."
666,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,Only been using for almost a week and so far I love it especially the price !
667,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I've only had it for just over a month so far, but so far for $250 it's been a great great value. No complaints. I am a heavy mobile user, meaning I run my businesses on it, as well as social media, movies, etc, and it's been flawless so far. I love the memory size in particular, I regularly use literally hundreds of apps for business and various purposes, and with my last phone I was always having to delete some app I would try to do without so that I could install another one I needed, only to have to do it all over again when I needed that app again after all! But 256Gb is enough for quite a few apps before I have to do that."
668,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I chose this phone because it is 5G model that supposed to work well with my service provider. Honestly speaking, I love my old Samsung Galaxy A71 better. This Moto g Stylus is much heavier and the camera is inferior in quality as compared to A71. Battery life is shorter than what has been described. I have to charge the phone at once or twice per day.  Do not like that there is no photo gallery or photo application but directly links to google photo.  I wish that I have picked up a Galaxy but the prices of those new Samsung models are too high and Samsung is so cheap to not to include a super charger in the pack.Overall, this Moto g Stylus is a okay phone, just me who has been spoiled to have a cellphone with a good camera that feel not contended."
669,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,Love love love
670,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I like this phone. Good size screen. 5G is fast, but the battery is not quite as advertised. I have to charge it more often than I'd like, but it's not the worst."
671,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,UPDATE: Installed ANDROID 12 AND IMMEDIATELY LOST 5G AND 5GHZ hotspot. There is a hack to turn 5G back on but I still can't get the 5GHz wifi signal to turn back on. I'm stuck with the phone since I bought it over 40 days ago so I missed the return window. It worked great on Android 11 so if you but one hold off on the update if internet speed is important to you.The phone was a wee bit sluggish out the box from the native GUI but installing Nova fixed all that. As far as 5G speeds I get Speedtest scores of 680Mbps down and 94.1Mbps up on the high side. Average speeds are closer to the 300's. It all depends on where the tower is and proximity. Remember phones are not omnidirectional. My best speed can vary depending on angle and direction of the phone so I use a large rotating phone stand for best signal when using the hotspot. Real world speeds for me are from 8MB/s to as high as 22MB/s with an average clock of 14MB/s on internal downloads to the phone. Using the phone as a hotspot I get an average of 3MB/s - 4MB/s. I'm glad I have an unlimited plan because it's very easy to burn through 250GB a day just on the hotspot alone running all the devices in my home. There is also an amazing overcharge prevention feature that requires an alarm preset to work. This keeps the phone topped at 80 percent until 30 minutes before the alarm goes off then it finishes the 100 by the alarm bell. So far I really like the phone.
672,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Works like a new cellphone, but I think was not new because it had fingerprints in the screen."
673,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,It's worth much. more then$200
674,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,This time I got good working new set. This time seller was Amazon not as third party. I like to use this set and good long time battery  but only issue is that when calling to any person that time volume is very low. I have full up volume but hard to listen. Only this issue I m trying to fix it but still not good. But over all performance of this set is good.
675,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Over all it's an amazing phone it works and runs exactly for what I need it for it just has two things that grind my gears so to speak.1. Whenever I turn my Bluetooth off, and yes I make sure I actually turn it off, not but 30 seconds later it's right back on and I have to turn it off again.2. If you are a fan of headphones connected thru usb-c, then be prepared for your phone to shut off a lot. Like everytime you pause the music, at first it was funny now it's annoying.3. The more and more I use this phone it starts to either double type letters or ignore letters I hit on the key board.Other than these 3 hight MINOR things it is over all an amazing phone, with a wonderful camera and an amazing battery life."
676,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Full disclosure: I think of a mobile phone as a commodity and buy accordingly. If you think you need a $1200 phone with a 48MP camera to take pictures of your cats, good for you; I do not. That said, I do expect a basic level of functionality regardless of price. In that regard, this phone fails on several fronts.First, the face recognition is useless. It does work, but it drains the battery so much that it reduces battery life by over 50%.Second, the fingerprint reader on the side power button must be the most stupid design ever. Even with the fingerprint set to ""light pressure"" by the time you apply enough pressure to have your fingerprint read, you have also triggered the power button. So the phone flashes on from the fingerprint unlock, then locks immediately from the power button.Third, the screen will not stay on. I have the screen set to shut off after two minutes. This setting is often completely ignored and the phone goes dim at 15 seconds, then off fully at 20 seconds. I do not have any power saving settings enabled. It does not happen all the time and does not always happen at 15 seconds. but it never makes it to the 2 minute mark. I just tried it now and it shut off at 48 seconds.That said, the battery life is pretty good as I only have to charge it every few days. The voice quality is good as is the speakerphone. It seems to be rather durable having been dropped a couple of times from waist height onto a hardwood floor with no cracking of the screen. The glass does etch very easily though.It's 5G, but I don't care. I'm on wi-fi most of the time for data and 5G offers no improvements over 4G/VoLTE for voice calls.All considered, I'll stick with my $100 price-point phones, use them up, and then get a new one."
677,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I purchased this phone to use as my second device. Honestly, for the money it has not disappointed me. When purchasing phones at this price point, there is always a little give and take when it comes to performance and features. However, I do think OnePlus has struck a nice balance with this model.When I unboxed it the first thing that struck me was the build quality. This absolutely maintains the form factor of their more expensive devices. My primary phone is a OnePlus 8T and this is definitely reminiscent of that.As far as the features and performance is concerned, everything works as it is supposed to. I am actually very impressed by the side mounted fingerprint sensor which doubles as the power button. It works quickly and efficiently and I really feel that even they're more expensive devices should have this feature. In addition, the screen resolution and viewing angles are very sharp and the phones battery power is amazing. I am also very impressed with the single firing speaker at the bottom of the device. A lot of companies tend to cheap out on their speakers when it comes to their more affordable devices. Fortunately, the sound is crisp and clear and definitely not tinny.Connectivity has definitely not been a problem since I purchased the phone. I am not only getting 4G LTE connections but, 5G is connecting exactly how it should. Although, when it comes to factory unlocked OnePlus devices 5G is only capable on the T-Mobile network and it's other carriers such as Metro by t-mobile, mint mobile and many others. Thus, don't expect to get 5G on networks like AT&t, Verizon and their subsidiaries because, it will not happen.Oneplus decided to equip this phone with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G processor which is rated at 2.0 GHz per second. They also equipped the phone with 4 GB of RAM. The best way to describe the processing performance is steady and reliable. It is not the fastest processor in the world but, it will get the job done. After all, this is a $240 phone and not one of their $1,000 models. Frankly, you cannot expect flagship performance like you would get with the Snapdragon 865 chipset or the Snapdragon 888. Again, it is not the fastest processor in the world but, it is not the slowest by far. You will have absolutely no problems performing day-to-day tasks, streaming movies and even gaming to a degree. Moreover, the 90 Hertz screen refresh rate definitely compensates for a lot of this.Understand, I am reading this device for what it is and not based on what it's not. If you are looking for a reliable good looking smartphone and you don't want to pay a lot of money then this is really the device you want. I have used it for about a month now and I am very happy with it. I would definitely not hesitate to recommend it."
678,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"While this phone is fast switching from task to task it has froze on me. I had to restart the phone to un freeze. I've had this phone about 4 months and I do need to charge it every night. It charges up fast, but the more apps I download the more the battery deletes. Each app I download I restrict battery usage.I use my phone for games and social media, I am not on it constantly.Overall, I would buy this phone but not for $150 or $180. Don't remember exact price, but with warranty, close to $200."
679,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Needed a new camera and saw this new model, figured the specs shows average reviews, but seemed good with the latest chipset and OS.  It boggs down a bit when running a few apps, and when opening an app seems like it takes a few seconds longer then my old phone.  I had a Ulefone 9E, older but battery was a bit better on that one and apps opened a lot faster."
680,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I am a bottom feeder. I like to get a lot for a little $. When I saw the price and what this phone does and what is packed in this phone, there was some doubt that it was that good. Sometimes 'cheap' phones are actually cheap but also lack function and are disappointing. This ONEPLUS N200 5G - actually delivers.The N200 looks good. The screen is bright and responds fast. The fingerprint reader is positioned a little higher than I like but not enough to make it not pleasing to use. If you do not like to use fingerprint then use the face recognition. The N200 is very fast. The size of the phone is large but it is slightly a little narrow. This makes for fitting in a hand comfortable. The back is plastic but then a phone case will protect it.It is Android with what ONEPLUS calls 'Oxygen'. This means a few 'bells and whistles' make the phone fun to use. If you used Samsung or Motorola there is a very little learning curve.I purchased this phone based upon Amazon's return policy. If i did not like the phone then I would return it and get something I do like. This phone is a keeper. I like it. I like it a lot!I read many reviews about this phone and almost everything about this phone was favorable except the camera. I was very skeptical about the picture quality. After using the camera and being critical I decided it is not that bad. I compared the photos to the new Apple iPhone SE 5G (2022). Yes the iPhone had better quality photos but not by much. The iPhone costs twice the price of the N200. The photos in the N200 are better than Motorola G7 Plus phone. The N200 phone is acceptable for photos in my opinion.One thing you cannot beat is the price of this phone."
681,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Cameras are nothing to write home about but are serviceable in good lighting. I picked this up as my primary phone after I gave my OnePlus 9 Pro to my GF after she destroyed her phone.Top reasons for my pick on this one:3.5mm headphone jackMicroSD card support (I have a 1TB in mine currently, loaded with music, ROMs, and a few movies when traveling)The underrated Snapdragon 480 (PS2 emulation is possible, lighter titles only)The size and feel in hand is superb in comparison to others in this weight class.Top criticisms I have:Cameras are lacking in finer details, noisy in lowlightPlastic back will pick up scratches easily - a case is highly recommendedThe fingerprint reader is temperamental at timesOverall, this is a solid and affordable option for those not wanting to plop down $1k or more for a phone that will easily do 95% what a flagship can. The Nord N200 5G will have 95% of the performance of flagships in your daily use (social media, web browsing, listening to music/watching movies). Surprising to me, shortly after setup and installing some emulators, this thing will run PS2 and GameCube games rather well (and beyond my expectations in most cases), anything older, aside from Sega Saturn is flawless. Not the gaming phone I had expected, but it definitely was a welcome bonus to the land of phones lacking 3.5mm audio and microSD support (seriously, Sony is the only flagship maker still putting this out). Pick up a good controller (such as a Razer Kishi, or an 8bitdo) and get some classic gaming in while on a plane or subway.This is a solid recommend if you don't require flagship specs and flagship pricing."
682,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,Piece of crap. Cant use it for making calls cause they forgot to put an antenna in it. Drops calls faster than it connects. Sent it back and got a refund. Don't buy!!!!!
683,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"It's pretty big. I don't use facial recognition because there's really no need for it and it's stupid anyway. Fingerprint sensor is pretty good. The camera leaves a lot to be desired especially if your coming off of an iphone but I knew that going in. I wanted to get a Google phone but too expensive. So I settled on this. It's pretty good, charges quickly. And it looks really nice just out of the box. I was tired of Samsung budget series wannabe S series. The last two I had were glitchy as hell. And Unless you wanna spend at least 300 on a better model Motorola I feel like they are right in the same category as the those Samsung phones. The last one I had was really crappy. So if don't wanna spend hundreds on a new ugly 49 camera lenses iPhone and your sick of Samsung and Motorola, I'd  say go ahead and get this. There are better phones probably. But not many as fast as this one for the same amount of money. Overall I'm happy with the purchase after having had it for a couple of months."
684,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I bought this phone to replace the hand-me-down my son had been using. It's our second OnePlus phone and both have been great. This model is 5G and has massive battery capacity. Even with all the socializing and gaming he does (after all his homework in done, of course! ;) ) the battery is usually still above 40% at the end of the day. Great features, snappy performance, and excellent battery life."
685,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,Little slow. Google assistant doesn't launch many time. Okay for the price to get a 5g phone.
686,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I've lost count of the mobile phones I've owned over the past 20 years and this model is clearly the best in every way. The price/performance ratio is unbeatable. The only weakness of this phone is the ability to use a finger print to unlock, but since the face unlock works so well the finger print issue is irrelevant for me.  Taking pictures and videos are intuitive and pretty much fool proof. Navigation is simple and easy. Speakerphone is excellent."
687,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"This is the best 5G phone for subpar -$500 or less budget market. The interface offers fast, buttery operations with above average somewhere north of 60 GHz exchange rate from the middling cpu, 6.4"" screen and massive battery that easily lasted a day and a half of moderate use with very good multitask (apps) performance from supposedly top-notched hardwares, at least  on paper. The latest Nord iteration also ups the ante on aesthetic with a sleek, smooth composite profile especially the back cover, giving it a premium feel. 5G experience on T-MOBILE was noticably better than LTE though not a fast pronounced as than the one on Verizon. The camera takes great photos outdoors and marginal indoor shoots with poor mode or those with little light. Finally, the price is right at around $250 (I nabbed it for $199 during a short promo), making it not just the cheapest 5G set but best budget phone of the year hands down over comparable rivals that I've owned or used like Moto G power and Samsung budget A-series."
688,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I purchased this phone as second phone.  I have a OnePlus 10 pro 5g and needed a 5g phone for second phone.  The Nord line is a good value, not too of the line but reasonable downgrades. I like how it does 5g on my Mint/T-Mobile network easily.  The OS is different but the UI is not bad.  I would not recommend this for use with AT&T but good with T-Mobile and Verizon.  It has both 2.4 and 5 WiFi.  Chipset is reasonably responsive.  Camera average.  I picked this over a Samsung Galaxy A53."
689,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Nice phone, great price, but uploading data from previous phone, an older Motorola brand was difficult.  Finally got everything loaded, but had to seek out help to get contacts and texts uploaded to new phone."
690,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,Works great.  Very happy with it.  Combined it with Tello wireless plan for $10/month for unlimited calling and texting and am ready to ditch the landline.
691,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I was happy with my oneplus 5T, but it was starting to get a bit unreliable. I was looking for an excuse to upgrade to a 5g phone, and this seemed like a good deal. I was familiar with the companies work on budget phones before and decided, what the heck!BOY WAS I WRONG... Sort ofThis phone is good enough for me not to return it. That's. It.It is NOT good enough for me to not have an issue with it.It's a short list for me but heavy hitting in my assessment.Start with the positives,The screen is real nice, I was a bit worried with it not being oled, but it looks good very clean. Not too reflective in sunlight, and the blacks are black.I appreciate the headphone jack and that was big in my decision for searching for a phone.NegativesTyping on this... Takes some getting used to, if you use typing vibrations they make the whole experience feel mushy, almost as if the vibration motor isn't at full power, short vibrations very weak and not ""buzzy"".The camera on this thing is a piece of work,The system is built in with image beautification that is a huge pain in the butt. In the camera app you can turn it off and manage to get an, ""on par"" picture you'd be expecting.However, if you use any apps that use a camera ie. Snapchat, tough luck, not setting for you.I am extremely dissatisfied with the camera.All this being said, I think to myself. ""you just bought this phone for $210, in 2022, shut up""Only taking price into consideration, it's an ok deal, especially if you don't use the camera.Taking into consideration OnePlus's history with challenging what can be done in a budget device... Kinda feels like I'm settling with this one.If i was still looking for phone, I'd pass this one up."
692,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"This phone comes with a 5G supported snapdragon chipset (400 series) and also shipped with a 5000mAh battery. I do understand that this is a budget phone but it does not do justice to its battery capacity.Firstly, if you just want an android phone 5G supported and with a large screen, this phone fits the requirement well. It has a 90Hz refresh rate screen and its max brightness is manageable in Arizona summer days. Has a fingerprint sensor on the unlock button. For day to day purposes, this phone can get most of the stuff done such as calls and emails. Light gaming can be done too but don't expect this to run heavy games like Genshin Impact (runs at 10 fps).The cameras are not good at all. Does not even take good quality photos even with ample light and the night mode is pretty non existent. It's portrait mode shots are much worser than that of the main camera. (Am I expecting too much from buget phones these days? Samsung buget segment can take better photos).Finally the battery: Initially it was great, lasted two whole days with 60 Hz and lasted a whole day with 15% left in the beginning of the following day with 90Hz mode. After about 5 months, it barely stays alive for a whole day with 60Hz screen running and if enable power saver mode, it lasts a couple more hours. (I am a light user btw).I would probably go with samsung for the budget segment, or if you can squeeze out some more during the black friday season, you probably can go for the pixel 6a phones."
693,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"This is far and away the worst cellphone i have ever paid for; i was forced to buy a 5g phone due to carrier nonsense. The memory amount is low, and the ""swap"" is too aggressive. if i get a text message while in an app like twitter or whatever, when i come back to twitter it needs to reload everything, because android swaps out the twitter stuff to display the SMS interface. It does this for every app. In a messaging app and click a link? after you close out the browser it needs to reload the messaging app. This makes using this phone a tedious nightmare for anything beyond ""texting"".The screen is either too dim or way too bright, everything in the middle is ""almost too dim"" and ""almost too bright"" with no ""perfect"" setting. The automatic dimming function is hot garbage. The screen itself is pretty low quality, compared to other $200-$250 phones.The cameras may as well not even be there. While they're better than the flip phone era cameras, the image quality this phone outputs is embarrassing. So i have to carry two phones or a phone and a camera to be able to freely take decent pictures anywhere, like i am used to.The battery life is pretty atrocious. I think this is partially due to the screen being low quality and often too bright, and the ""disk"" / storage writes to swap out apps due to low memory. It also requires a *different* type of charger than every other phone on the market. You have QC or IQ or PD chargers already? Well no fast charging on the Oneplus Nord N200 5g. 1% every two minutes. They use DASH or WARP or something. It isn't worth paying extra for a car charger and a charger ""for the office"" - which you will wish you had, because this battery isn't lasting all day, that's for sure.The gyroscopic sensors are bad. Every time i unlock the phone it ""quickly"" switches from portrait to landscape back to portrait, no matter how i hold it while unlocking. I put quickly in quotes because this whole thing takes about 4-5 seconds to settle on portrait mode. Every time i unlock it.Bluetooth always requires fiddling - It will connect to, for instance, a car stereo. Then Disconnect. Then you have to go into bluetooth settings and manually click the car's bluetooth name. Then it might work, about 60% of the time. This is another few minutes a few times a day wasted waiting on this phone.I cannot figure out where the $200-$235 i spent on this phone actually went. Every feature is poor. This phone costs me about 20-30 minutes *every day* in waiting for it to do stuff that phones have been doing for 12 years without any issues.I will say, and the reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1, that the phone call quality is decent, and the speaker is passable. 5g doesn't seem any faster than 4g, but that's a carrier thing, probably. I haven't tested this on other carriers, so it is possible that the modem inside is faster than an LTE modem, but i really doubt it. It's probably the same CAT level as bargain basement LTE phones have.Just stay away from this phone, unless you just need the phone app and a messaging/SMS app. it's ""ok"" at both of those things."
694,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Note: Will not send texts via Verizon/TracFone.Nice clean Android with very little frou-frou.  Works fine on the right networks. The camera isn't horrible, but would be great if it was better. I have trouble with the fingerprint reader and have to keep my thumbnail short for it to work, but that is probably just me. The battery life is good."
695,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Just about a month and a half old and so far so good. I was expecting the battery to be better. Sure, it's fast charging and that's great. But it can deplete fast too. I had an unknown Chinese branded phone before this and its battery lasted way longer than this one."
696,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,Good value for the price.Would have liked a finger print scanner on the back for the index finger like the OnePlus5.Would have preferred just one quality camera instead of three so-so camsHeadphone jack is back!
697,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"For the price great phone. It was just a bit tat slow for my wife. She yelled at me for taking too long to send her driving directions to her phone. When in reality my phone was just ""slow"" to her flagship Pixel 5 standards to open up Google maps. I like the phone. The one complain will be the front facing camera hole. Around that area there's a shadow like smudge. I've seen it on display models at BestBuy too. I think it's just a poor quality panel that OnePlus just on the phone. But I mean for the price you can't really complain its really a good phone."
698,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"This is a great phone for the price.  It is very frustrating how the manufacturers have convinced everyone that good phones cost $1200 and if you have to settle, then spend $500 on a discount phone.  Nonsense.  For people making 5 videos a day, editing the videos and posting on YouTube or tiktok, or people who spend 6 hours a day playing very graphics intensive games, maybe a flagship phone is useful.  But there are huge numbers of people who just want a phone to make calls (imagine!), text with people, get directions in Google maps or Waze, use some other apps like Uber, banking, etc.  This phone is way more than great for that.  It has a very nice screen, looks great, works smoothly and quickly on apps, makes calls well . . . Everything non-power users use a phone for.  I highly recommend it."
699,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"My prior phone, a Google Pixel 3, had been entering an infinite boot loop due to an overly sensitive power button, so I thought I would give the OnePlus brand a try. The Nord 200 fell nicely into my desired price range, and although it wasn't important to me, it also had 5G.I generally have found that when going from a 3+ year old phone to newer one, the performance has increased. Not so with the Nord 200 (released in June 2021). On paper, the specs seemed to lean in favor of the OnePlus, if slightly. However, after unboxing and installing my software, I found the UI to be sluggish at the best of times. It's downright frustrating at others.Bottom line: I didn't do my homework, and I didn't realize how spoiled I was with the Pixel 3. As a budget phone, this is probably good enough, but I feel if I had spent another $60 on the OnePlus N10, I would have been happier. PC Mag feels this is one of the best low-budget phone on the market. Maybe. I have a couple days to decide if I'm keeping it or returning it; I haven't decided.My Geekbench results: Single-core 481, Multi-core 1271."
700,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,Battery life is wonderful it's 5g and has a decent fingerprint reader and a 90hz refresh rate good for gaming and is a very reasonable price camera is pretty decent if you are good at taking pictures good picture will be taken if your not then it won't take good pictures and won't be helped by the software as much as other phones but I rate this thing highly much better then my old Samsung note s8 and s7 edge and s5active also the back of the phone feels odly nice
701,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"The cellphone was large and heavier than expected. So I didn't even turn it on. I returned it immediately. The seller didn't have a valid return tracking with UPS. Since 7-22-2022, the return wasn't processed."
702,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"This phone is an excellent value for what you need in a mobile device. It does not have all the high end specs, but it does what those specs would otherwise do very well. Canâ€™t go wrong with this buyâ€¦â€¦."
703,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,fast delivery and full help with troubleshooting (only needed because of android update resetting mine)
704,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Phone is snappy in menus but slows down when starting and ending calls, this includes whatsapp or messenger calls.  It seems when connecting any type of call the added network load is a bit too much for the processing units. Other than this very minor annoyance, One+ seem to think It's OK for them to not allow you to turn their own advertisement and app notifications, so basically you can turn off any other app notifications except the One+ apps.Phone was purchased for a pre-teen and the quality, speed, battery life to price ratio is great. Overall it's a quality device and does exactly what we needed it to do.  We are able to overlook the annoyances."
705,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Very unimpressed with this phone. I had to replace my one-year-old Redmi Note 9 Pro phone because of the 5G transition required by the ISPs.  I LOVED the Redmi. I do not love--or even like a lot--the Nord OnePlus.The screen is dark:  to bring the light up to the level needed to illuminate the data/apps, particularly when using it outside, it drains the battery rather quickly.The quick app menu icons (e.g., to take screenshots) are ridiculously large, very asthetically DISpleasing. There is no way to make them smaller other than installing a brand-new app loader.The camera app they had preinstalled was demanding I give it access to contacts, phone numbers, etc. No, thank you!  I replaced the app with another one from GooglePlay, which, btw, is superior in its photo features and quality.Constant nagging from Nord to ""finish setting up"" the phone--which actually means insisting I join their ""community"".  No, Thank you!Slow charging. Not the super-fast speed they claim."
706,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I like the camera on this phone it takes nice clear photo's and the battery is long life and fast charging. I ended up paying too much for it though when I could have got it at my Metro PCS store for 120.00 set up, I ended up paying over 300.00 with it being switched and a case. Next time I'm going to look at the store before I go and order one. The only problem with this phone is that during call's sometimes the speaker phone will not work on the first try."
707,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,need a phone with more options
708,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Purchased this to migrate from a deteriorating level of Verizon service at my home. I had been informed by a neighbor the local T-Mobile service could actually provide a usable signal without racing outdoors. Good decision.Although the motivation was network performance, the phone itself is a good choice for those who don't need 'flagship' features on their phone. The phone is thin, lightweight with good resolution and adequate battery life. Overall, I'm a happy camper. Would buy again. Would recommend to family or friends who don't have 'extraordinary' expectations."
709,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I got this as a temp replacement when my pixel bricked itself updating. I figured yeah it's a little cheaper but whatever how bad could it be? BAD. The fast charging feature is either a fake selling point or I got a dud. Even brand new it took all night to fully charge, I now have to have it plugged in pretty much everywhere I go, or it'll die. It's only about 7 months old. Having 5G doesn't really count for much when the phone itself is slow. VERY slow, takes about a second or two to respond when opening apps or going thru different screens, frequently ending up clicking things you didn't want too because it took so long to load. The cameras might be a decent mp number but it doesn't look like it, always a little blurry and washed out. Overall this phone works as if it was made and released ten years ago. I'd never recommend it."
710,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,This phone is better than Apple in every way. The camera is better the speed is better and everything people who review this phone does NOT know what they are talking about. With my iPhone 11 pro Max I would get so many typos it was ridiculous but with this phone not so many typos only time I would get typos if I accidently pushed the wrong button cause my hands are too big. The camera is beautiful it's not slow at all I don't know what these other so called reviewers are talking about but from now on I'm gonna be in the one plus family for a long time. I only had this phone for a couple of days and it's doing well so far which I like other people on here expect more from a budget phone like why would you put high end stuff that you can only find with a thousand dollar phone and put it in a budget phone it's called a budget phone for a reason idiots. The battery holds up great for me and with all the reviews saying you can't add it to Sprint or Verizon network then don't cry and complain about it put it on another network and if you can't just buy another phone it's not that hard. When I get my paycheck again I'm gonna be buying the OnePlus 9 and I'll be back to reviewing another great phone HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! (Edit)This phone is trash now they're aren't new updates it's stuck on Android 11 and will not update it's slow and just good never get a cheap phone from a major company there will always be flaws.
711,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I have always been an iPhone user, unfortunately my iPhone 11 stops working. In a rush to find a new phone  I give the chance to One Plus after checking many reviews. The phone appearance and interface is very friendly and easy to use. Even thought the phone have 3 cameras is difficult to get a fast shot.My trading apps runs smooth, also my games with the gaming mode runs like amazing!The fingerprint recognized fast the finger it remind me the old iPhone versions.I can say that the best feature of this phone is the battery it can last days among the the fast charging.If you find  yourself in a situation of a rush for a phone this is definitely your best option of the market."

Seems like a VERY lite android version, which is inconvenient. Cameras are very bad. Battery life is great! I appreciate the 64gb internal storage. I never use face recognition or fingerprint readers as I find them ridiculous and unnecessary unless you are hoping to send that extra info for  governmental use. Looks and feels good/quality. I don't hate it but can't recommend it either. For the price it's barely ok."
714,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Pros- affordable, quick connection to internet.  I like the larger keypad that comes bc of larger screen.  I haven't used facial or fingerprint recognition to review.Cons- feels heavy compared to the S8.  Too many apps in the set up.  Some are mine of course.  It is so different from my Samsung's, which were so easy to upgrade from a previous model S.Battery life A+I'm not super tech savyThat said, a month out, and I am getting used to it.For around a $250+- it is a good phone."
715,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I am a multi phone user. When it came to investing in a phone for work I did my research and looked for the most middle middle performing phone out there. This was it. It has performed above expectations without overachieving and does not compete with my higher end flagships. But as a solid phone with the ability to get some mileage out of it for the cost, the battery and okay performance this phone is good."
716,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Was hoping for a little more out of a OnePlus phone and this did not live up to the hype. I know it was cheap, but couldn't even switch between apps without launching the app again."
717,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"This is a Super Nice phone. These phones are (NOT) locked to T-Moblile. My carrier is AT&T. It has an advanced technology, operating system, function, and the fingerprint reader works better than any phone I've had. Having said that, it's very easy to setup. I have AT&T as my carrier, I just swaped the sim card from my old phone and it was ready to setup. Keep in mind this phone does have a Setup Wizard which guides you throught the process. It does have a slot for expandable memory. The technology of this phone works great, I have a pair of Raycon E55 earbuds that have the new 5.0 bluetooth technology (stereo sound) and they sounded awesome on my previous phone but they sound even better on this new N200 5G. I was conflicted between buying the N200 5G and N10 5G, both are very similar but personally I think the N200 5G is the better model. Do yourself a favor and spend an extra few dollars to buy the suggested phone protection case with a black surround. This phone is worth protecting the cameras on the back, against shock if dropped, and it will keep the phone from sliding around as it is very lightweight (but very good quality) and has a slick surface. I can't say enough about how impressive this phone is. Buy it!!!Update 10-4-2022. I've had this phone for over a year and it still works great!!! I've since then switched carriers from AT&T to T-Mobile for a better rate. The T-Mobile switch was super easy and the service-reception & transmission is as good if not better. This is an awesome phone, buy it with confidence!"
718,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,I like the design and the fingerprint recognition is excellent
719,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I normally buy an unlocked Android every 2 years. I go generic or off brand. This is my third OnePlus. It's by far my worst experience.The phone is just slow and horribly buggy. I had to do navigation for my wife while driving. By the time the app loads we have passed our exit.When I have to take a picture of the kids, by the time my phone unlocks and the camera application has loaded the moment has passed.Sometimes I'll need to do something with my Tesla car with my phone. I look like an idiot waiting on this stupid phone to load so I can open my car charging port.It also works in about 90% of the places my wife's phone works on TMobile.My ownership experience has been mostly disappointment and frustration. I can't recommend this to anyone who isn't on a budget or desperate."
720,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I'm disappointed - I really like the phone...  Thumb print reader was far more reliable than the Pixel, battery life was good, navigation made sense to me.  Sadly, the GPS gave up working just a few days after the 1 year mark"
721,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"The Nord is a solid budget phone, with a bright screen and excellent battery life. The camera is the downfall, itâ€™s just average, but usable. Occasionally, the software will lag slightly, but not enough to not really like this phone. The feature that makes up for this is the 5G support. Itâ€™s good. Relative to the price, Iâ€™d buy it again. Recommended"
722,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I need a phone to browse the web, access some media apps, read books, use chat apps, use maps, maintain my calendar, and send texts/calls.  That's it.  The occasional video watching, too.This phone is glorious, the battery life is huge (I can go 2.5-3 days without recharging).  It doesn't get warm when used for long periods.  It is much faster than my way old outdated phone.Unless you consume media (streaming, videos, active gaming) predominantly on your phone, this one is fantastic.  And it met all of my needs and then some.  Fingerprint scanner can be a little fussy, but thankfully it's not really high on my needs."
723,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"The main issue I've experienced, although there were others as well, is with the Voice Mail function.  EVERY time that I raise the phone near my face to listen to a message, the message immediately stops playing.  I've been through the tech help procedure twice. You know, trying to follow test procedures given on the phone by someone with a barely understandable accent. Then getting my lengthy call escalated to another ""more qualified"" tech agent again in ASIA. Still had no success. I returned the phone as defective by their suggestion. I simply ordered an identical replacement phone. Guess what I got.  An identical problem as the first phone. These appear to be SUBSTANDARD phones to me. I cannot recommend a purchase of this phone to anyone.  I'm quite disappointed with it.  Also, it is now a true 5G phone as advertised. But that is another issue.  UDATE: Few days later, now the phone is completely unusable. It has gone berserk! I can't even describe all the bizarre things it is doing. I lost $200 and my mind over this useless phone. UPDATE: After a lengthy and eventful conversation with an Amazon Help agent I got some success. The phone went haywire. It even dialed EMERGENCY on its own. With the Sheriff knocking at my front door to check up on me due to the false emergency call, I got a little more ""animated"" with the Amazon agent via chat(the phone was inoperable) on my PC. Result? ""I've successfully process your refund amounting of $225.21 Your refund will reflect on your gift card balance within 1-3 hours.â€‹"" Yeah for Amazon and the devil with OnePlus Nord N200 | 5G Unlocked Android Smartphone U.S Version.  I want nothing more to do with this phone or vendor"
724,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I bought this cell for my daughter who is an aerospace engineering student at UCF in Orlando FL.It works extremely well in our area of Kissimmee which is notorious for bad cell reception. Mint Mobile's coverage and cost along with  the OnePlus Nord N200 | 5G has helped her through the pandemic and online courses as well as her association responsibilities. I can't say enough good things about this cell phone, having had numerous others prior to it. I strongly recommend to anyone who wants an affordable, dependable cell to help them get through our hectic lives."
725,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"The phone was great for the first couple of weeks in maybe June 2022, but only after downloading ALL of the system updates, it turned to trash very fast. I don't know if the system updates were a correlation or causation, but soon after, it would overheat just from having the Home Screen open. It'd freeze in camera mode, apps would crash. Couldn't watch YouTube on low quality without the phone cooking your bare hands. All the general android operating system faults and errors you'd expect to happen is what you got in less than 30 days of owning this device. HD phone calls are great, the camera quality is comparable to a 2019 model iPhone, the external audio is great, the phone is very clean in its outward design. But that doesn't outweigh the cons. I returned the device because after all the updates, including the nord preloaded apps' updates, the phone couldn't complete simple processes as well anymore."
726,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,For the price it works great. I can use many apps. The volume is great. The only problem I have found is I can't get it to download mhtml files. But if you get a viewer app you can see the pages you download. But other than that it works great.
727,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,"I don't know about phone specs but this is the perfect mp3 player for your blu tooth devices, I don't like to use my phone for outdoor mp3 speaker, especially in busy locations where people can hack blu tooth connections, download Music player from Google store, I brought a MP3 device for the same price and it sucked, couldn't navigate thru thousands of songs, arrow up and down only, or you have to know the title of song to pinpoint, this on the other hand is a powerful android device."

It has served its purpose, it is teaching her to use the phone, and helping teach her the importance of taking care of her items.  This phone does break very easily. (What else would you expect from a cheap phone) so definitely but a decent case and screen protector. This will make sure you avoid my mistake, and have to purchase a new phone.  Would definitely buy this as a 1st phone again though."
729,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,Hate google but phone is ok.
730,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,I needed a phone it was a nightmare to activate not setting it up. Customer is lazy and don't want to be bothered because of themselves and not bad but goodness of the phoneI ignore that because it off me several other way to get done. That even more better without them to deal with that simple. Online or Text activation via wifi
731,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,Bought to use as a dedicated IP camera.  Works great as a wireless Webcam
732,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,Bought it for a guest from overseas to use whilst visiting and it had a lot of the features of a more expensive phone and way cheaper than using the phone from overseas (without WiFi) wasnâ€™t the easiest to set up but that may be because Iâ€™m more used to a different smartphone. Very useful.
733,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,Easy to use. Value for the money and affordable cards to reload
734,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,"I have always used my old phone to mount on the handlebars of my bike for Strava trail navigation. That way I can keep my current phone tucked away safe in my hydration pack. After leaving my S9 in Sedona.. oops and then crashing onto my even older S7 active I needed a new cheap phone to put onto my handle bars. Both of the previous mentioned phones are still going for 150$+++. Introducing the Blu for 29$. It works perfect. I just connect it to the mobile hot spot on current good phone and everything works. Strava works great, battery life is really good, even the camera is not half bad. Worth every penny."
735,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,"We bought this because my mother-in-law wanted a replacement for her non functioning Tracphone.  However, we were finally able to convince her to get a smartphone, which now she really likes."
736,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,"I picked up one of these to hold me over while my iPhone is in the shop. Beyond the jarring transition to an Android interface, the brand new box the phone came in didn't contain a charging cable (listed in the box contents and required to charge the phone). So, some quality control problems there -- but as I said in the title, you get what you pay for. But here's the bad part: when I called TracFone they informed me that I'd have to BUY the cable from them (their price: $24, Amazon's price for the same is 2 for $7). Why? Because I didn't buy the phone direct from TracFone. So, basically they don't stand behind their product, since this was an original packaging error. Just a heads-up if you're expecting much in the way of product support from this company. In terms of functionality? It'll work until I get my real phone back, so mission accomplished... with some grinding of teeth..."
737,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,"This phone is ""locked"" into Tracfone (service provider) and that's the problem.  Because their on line activation system said that my NH ZipCode (03301) was not a valid Zip, I had to call Customer Service... and that's where the real fiasco began.  They were certainly able to take my credit card information and apply the charge and tell me that my account was all established.  However, I soon discovered that I could not access my account because it had not actually been setup, so I had a phone number but no password.  The next call to Customer Service ended with the woman telling me that she had sent my password to my email address and that I should expect to receive it within 15 minutes or so.  No email arrived (after 2+ hrs).  My next (final) call to Customer Service uncovered that they had incorrectly entered my email address into my account...  and this woman ""sent"" another email to me that failed to arrive while we remained on the phone (20 minutes).  Because it was clear that email was not working, I simply asked her to tell me my password or text it to me.  When she said that she was not allowed to do that, I asked to speak to a supervisor.  I was then told that ""I am not allowed to transfer a call to a supervisor.""  After 15 minutes more of questioning, she continued to repeat the exact same words (as if reading from a 5"" x 7"" card)... and refused to acknowledge that there was no way for me to access my account or to get any help.After 59 minutes, I finally hung up.  I was polite, but firm because I knew that these are just underpaid, overworked call center employees that have neither the training nor the resources to actually provide any type of customer ""service.""  It's clear that Tracfone could  care less.I just wanted a temporary phone for an upcoming trip where I could not risk taking my real cell phone because of security issues.  The saying that ""You get what you pay for..."" doesn't even apply here because if the phone had been free, it would still be way overpriced.  Feel free to check the Internet and you'll see that I'm just another ex-customer (I lasted almost 6 hrs.) that learned the hard way to NEVER HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH TRACFONE!"

739,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,I wanted something that wasnâ€™t to expensive but my kids could use to their games and other apps and this phone had it all. It wasnâ€™t expensive and they are durable. It was well worth my money.
740,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,"I'm using Alfred Camera app (which turns your smartphone into a networked webcam), and needed an extra ""camera"" for my purposes. For $30, this Blu 2 phone was the answer. A sturdy if not speedy Android 11 device. Runs Alfred Camera perfectly, holds wifi signal as expected, camera is definitely good enough for my monitoring purposes. One caution: the small power block provided to charge the phone ran frighteningly hot! About 50Â°C (120Â°F) by my infrared thermometer. Didn't feel confident leaving that thing alone in the house plugged in while I was away. Replaced it with an older, cooler-running block and now having no worries... . If you're looking for an internet-only device to run Android apps, consider this."

744,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,Bought this phone a couple of days ago and it was working just fine until I had to charge it. The battery won't charge at all. I have used different chargers and power sources. This phone has died and will not be able to turn back on. I cannot use it. I also purchased a payment plan to use this phone but I also don't have access to that either.
745,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,Just got it. Now I'm going to run it. And we'll see performance
746,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,"I wanted this for my granddaughter to have until I can afford a decent phone.It sounded ok. I tried to activate online (it says you can ) but it kept saying it wasn't a tracfone .I had to call customer service- you know ,talk to someone who doesn't know English so that wasn't much fun. I was so aggravated over not being able to understand what she said! Funny I gave her the same numbers I entered online and she knew it was their phone. I paid $30 to have the 3 GB of data since it rolls over and I wasn't sure how much we'd need. Ok,so I scroll through settings and I see it says we have 2gb data and our plan is up in 3 weeks-I paid for 30 days. I tell her something is wrong, how can I use a whole gb just by turning the phone on!! Plus I didn't own the phone a week ago. I had just gotten it 15 min. before I called. I have my email to prove when it was delivered & besides that, I had just paid her the $30 so why wouldn't it show I have 30 days !! OMG! She also told me my zip code didn't exist- lol. Maybe not in India ! So, after much aggravation, I want to break this piece of crap phone. It is a rip-off and hopefully I can buy her a good phone soon. Please , don't buy this if you can buy anything else. They shouldn't be in business for the way they rip off people."
747,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,It actually a good phone. Good for the price.
748,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,It's a starter phone.  It's slow but works.

750,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,"The only thing I disliked had nothing to do with the phone it was tracfone itself. I called to activate it they said not compatible. I was going to return it. On tracfone website they had this phone. Called them back, after 3 people I'm now activated. They phone is great and what I don't understand I ask my daughter."
751,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,Its cheap and it lasts a long while.
752,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,"Have tried very hard to live with it and give it the benefit of the doubt as the problems continued to grow while performance drops like a stone.First I use mine for both phone and wifi internet, unfortunately for some idiotic reason they built it with the slow 2.4 band speed and no 5 ghz, needless to say online it is maddeningly SLOW while using a data service reception is no better. Video on either data or wifi seems limited to 480 dpi due to low end hardware.The screen also for some reason scratches with little more than just thinking about it while the battery has yet to charge above 97%, today it is 93%.For a majority of the software and performance problems I point my finger directly at GOOGLE who is continually adding garbage even when you say no and turning features on that you have turned off in the background, Android is every bit as much BLOATWARE (in the name of Security and Convenience) as Microsoft  and is nothing but a SPYWARE OS.The window has closed so I will ad it to the garbage can of what ifs and move on.Update:  Now the on off button is working when it feels like it, and internet has slowed to a crawl and getting Unstable Network warning, where with my 8 year old LG no such problems, gonna chuck this in file 13 and get another LG, even renewed."

755,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,"It's 30$ what can you expect? The Ram is not bad, it's kinda small but that's ok, it can be taken apart, and the phone is carrier locked, which means no sim card can be put in it, I called and asked to have it unlocked they said it would be 150$ to just unlock the phone, there's the catch for ya, if you have WiFi and it's just a home phone or just for small games it's fine and good, otherwise meh, it's also decently sturdy."
756,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,Usually I am happy with my cheap tracfones and they last a couple years. This one freezes very often and is having trouble opening things when I touch them. This is the first time I will just go buy a different one after having it less than a month.
757,TracFone,BLU View 2 (2022),32 GB,Android 11,5.45 Inches,"This phone wonâ€™t connect with my WiFi. Itâ€™s probably only for low speed WiFi connection. I thought that since it was a newer phone, it would at least connect to a 5 year old gaming router, but apparently the technology isnâ€™t quite there yet.At least it has a slot for a microSD card. But if youâ€™re using a carrier service on this phone, that slot wonâ€™t be available for your expanded storage. Iâ€™ve not tested how large of a capacity data card this phone can handle, but given itâ€™s inability to connect to modern WiFi, Iâ€™ll hazard a guess that it wonâ€™t be able to support a standard 256gb top class card, let alone a 1tb. I would at least hope it could handle a 16gb card, since those were standard almost a decade ago. But who knows.Maybe I can use it as a budget camera, Iâ€™ll tinker with it a while before I turn it into another POS coaster for my coffee mug.But hey, itâ€™s a $35 project. Iâ€™m not sore over the purchase. It wasnâ€™t what I wanted or expected, but itâ€™s a puzzle to figure out. At worst, Iâ€™ll just scavenger the parts for other little tech projects.I find it interesting that my i8 still has more functionality and connectivity than most phones developed today.Thanks TracFone, for the project phone. Iâ€™ll make use of it, somehow. Probably."

My S22 was stolen, so I bought a phone with payments through AT&T and somehow a glitch in my bill with AT&T said I owed $1378, when it was only $509 the previous month. Well, since no one could tell me anything but that the bill cycled, AT&T can just forget getting another dime from me. I was so afraid that I'd just hate this cheap phone. I love it! It does almost everything my expensive phone did! I only miss my edge panels and the on screen fingerprint reader. The pictures are not quite as sharp, but it does offer a night mode. It's just as fast, the screen is impressive and big. I honestly am so sorry that I've been wasting my money all these years on high priced Samsung Galaxy S series!

781,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"Amazing phone for the moneyLenovo has done a fantastic job since it acquired Motorola.Like my prior Motorola fones, this one has minimal bloatware for a near stock Android experience.Just a few easy to remove pre-installed games, and easy to remove Facebook app as well.FM radio app can't be removed, but it was easy to deactivate.Note:This fone will not work with a T-Mobile SIM, it requires a TracFone SIM.Even though TracFone does use in fact use T-Mobile towers, amongst others.Does work perfectly with my Walmart Family Mobile SIM card (running T-Mobile), as WFM is 100% owned by TracFone.Therefore, my WFM SIM is actually a Tracfone SIM card, connecting to the T-Mobile network.No tweaks during set up were needed, such as modifying the Access Point Name (APN).Put my SIM in, powered up, and followed prompts during set up.Even better, copied all settings and apps from my old fone to this one via WiFi.Followed prompts on both fones, to grant permission to copy.With 55 apps, took about 1 hour, but a very easy and automated process.Only ""downside"" of fone is large size, which is a plus for many.But, I'm quickly getting used to moving from a 5.5 inch phone, to this 6.5 inch.Also, greatly appreciate moving from a 16GB phone to this 32GB.Being able to keep as many Apps as one likes, and without needing to clear cache weekly to free up space for existing apps, is a huge upgrade, and big convivence.Yes, Apps can stored on an SD, but it's already near full of music, movies, and photos.I'm not a ""gamer"" so the 3GB of RAM works perfectly.No lags even when multi-tasking, etc.My only multi-tasking is listening to music via streaming or via an app from SD stored music, while a fitness tracker in running.Worked fine with prior Moto e6 2GB RAM fone, and still no problem with this 3GB RAM fone."
782,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"This phone is solid, nice feel, good weight, attractive in looks and easy to use.  For it's price, it is a great phone. Even though my previous phone still works great, it is 16 GB and I was running out of memory for apps.  I had to start removing apps as with each update of each app, they seemed to bloat taking up more and more memory.  That led me to needing a new phone with 32 GB of memory which led me to this phone.  Previously I always used LG Tracfones but I read LG is no longer making inexpensive Tracfones which is probably why they are no longer on Tracfone's website.  I always wondered how the Motorola phones were so when I saw this at a great price I bought it.  I have not connected it to Tracfone service yet as I want to have it setup to my liking before I do.  Even though it is still Android there are some differences with the Moto settings and its use of the features that make me prefer the LG phones but nothing that would make me not like it or want to use it.  My only complaint is no where on the Amazon listing for this phone did it say whether it is GSM or CDMA so I don't know whether Tracfone in my area will accept this phone.  The packing list said CDMA but according to Motorola's website it is GSM.  Then I read that Tracfone was bought by Verizon and as of November 2023 Tracfone plans will be changed.  There is some confusion whether Verizon is still CDMA or not.  So I don't know whether I will be able to use this phone after Verizon takes over.  Or whether I would stay with Verizon depending on their pricing policies for previous Tracfone customers.  But it is still a great phone so far."
783,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"Nice phone.  Migrating from a Samsung J3.  As others stated, this is an inexpensive phone.  Don't compare it to a $1k iPhone.  I thought it was a very good value for the price.The negative comes from the service, Tracfone.  The lesson I learned is that you should just go to your local Walmart/Best Buy/etc. and buy a Tracfone phone from there.There is an issue, and you will read about it in other reviews, where this phone (and I suspect other phones sold by Amazon) does not work with the Tracfone network where I live.I spent approximately 8 hours of the course of 2 or so weeks on support calls with Tracfone.  They could not figure out why the phone would not work.  Everything on their end was set up correctly.  But my phone did not have service.In the end, I returned this phone and went to my local Walmart and bought a similarly priced phone, activated it and had no issues using Tracfone service."
784,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,I broke my old Samsung Note and decided to give an Apple SE a shot as I was sick of carrying a huge phone anyways. Needed an android still for some apps I use and didnâ€™t need service or anything fancy. Shocked by how well this functions. They lose a star (which I only did after starting to write this) because of all the absolute junk they load onto the phone. But hey those junk apps like Facebook and Ticktock are probably giving Lenovo kickbacks to subsidize the price so not gonna complain too much. Battery life is great. Only need to use the phone sporadically for very brief amounts of time and Iâ€™ve had it unplugged for like 3 days and itâ€™s still at about 60% charge.
785,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"Motorola, better than most $ 1,000 cell phones. Locked on Tracfone. It does 5 G (owned by Communist china) a rather weak on cell reception (rather remote location), works well on wifi calling. Better to buy this than being locked into a rip off plan. And superior to ""off brand"" cell phones.  This with a $25 plan WILL SAVE YOU MONEY."
786,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,phone is amazing! works better than I had thought and definitely worth it for the price
787,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"My old phone (an LG, no longer making phones) had an older version of Android and could not be updated. This has Android 11, I got it during Prime days for a very good price. Transferring all the data from my old phone was relatively easy, I was able to do it over Wi-Fi. I have been a Tracfone user for many years and was able to transfer my unused minutes, data, and texts to the new phone and keep my phone number. It is very easy to use and has a very good Help section on the phone in the Settings menu.Update: Motorola updated my phone to Android 12 on November 26,2022."
788,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,Bought this as a replacement for a old device that I was using as a bed side alarm clock and for running the Lightning Bug sleep app. It runs everything fine and has some nice features that I wouldn't expect for the price.
789,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,Good job Tracfone this is one of your best phone out there. This is my second line phone for me company Awsome
790,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,phone is slow to load up and receive info
791,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"Ok, this is NOT an $800+ smart phone, so no one should be comparing it to one.  However, it wasn't that long ago that if you spend any less than $250 on a cheaper phone, it was absolute junk.  This (when on sale) is less than $50 and it's perfectly usable for many people.  The screen is decently bright and clear even though it's not ultra-high res.  You get a basic amount of RAM (3 gig) And storage (32 gig) but you can add a micro SD card to that and use any number of apps that keep junk files cleaned out, etc.  One speaker, but you can't expect stereo for this price; it's decently loud, though.The cameras are average but in good light the rear one does really well - in lower light, not so much, but if you tweak the pics in a decent photo app you can make them better.  The selfi cam is serviceable.  Video quality tops out at 1080p and is also average.  Tracfone can be hit or miss - they are NOT known for their customer service skills, but generally speaking the service works and there are few outages compared to some others.  If you have an older person who just wants a ""use at times"" phone or a kid who needs their first smart phone, this won't break the bank (just PLEASE read up on parental controls on Android before handing one over to a tween/teen!!).Once again - ""for the price"" I rate this phone highly.  Just understand what you are and are not getting."
792,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"This phone is great. It's cheap, and it's good for the amount paid. The camera quality isn't the best, but its not the worst I've ever seen."
793,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"Got these phones for my daughters for their birthday!  They donâ€™t have service, just use with WiFi when available. Camera is surprisingly quite nice!"
794,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"I bought this phone for my 15 yr old daughter, and she LOVES it! She said the screen is big, it takes good pictures and videos. She can stream and not worry about it crashing. For $50 this phone is Amazing! this phone is Awesome! My 16 yr old wants one for Christmas now! Teenager Approved!!"
795,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"The front camera is in the middle of the top of the screen which gets in the way sort of.The camera app is all icon based and full screen pic isnt the default.It does have a tilt feature that levels your pictures.Response is snappy and fast, but I havent filled it with apps yet."
796,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,UPDATE: Finally reached someone in tech support that was able to tell me where to find the PIN # that was preventing the phone from working. As soon as he said it was 4 digits I remembered a generic PIN that I haven't used in 10 years. Can't believe Tracfone kept this on file. Now I can explore what this phone offers. Raised review to 4 stars.Got this Motorola Moto G Pure cell phone one week ago and after reaching Tracfone was able to transfer my old Tracfone phone number to the Moto G phone. Then the fun started trying to get it to work. After turning on the phone it asks for a PIN number but there is none on any of the paperwork. Just a S/n and a SIM card #. Check Tracfone website and found a help screen that advised me of two different PIN numbers but neither worked. Without the PIN numbers the phone remains locked and unusable. When attempting to call my cell phone number I get a brief message that says my voice mail box hasn't been set up yet and the call is disconnected without a single ring. Contacted Tracfone Tech Support today and after waiting on hold for over an hour decided that enough time has been wasted. The end result is now my old Nokia Tracfone flip phone won't work either. If Customer Service reads this please contact me for one last help.
797,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,Love this phone for 50.99 bucks. Bought this one to replace another phone with cracked screen.  It bigger than I like but works great.

801,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"Canâ€™t afford to pay crazy cell phone bills anymore - this cell for me is temporary until I move back to iPhone - However, this cell is really great if you like Google, tracfone and Motorola being in every part of your life and selling all your personal information to everyone everywhere.  So far tracfone seems to be okay - there are locations where service to cell is questionable. Anytime your looking at the cell it can be hard to quickly recognize & select something (example if go to the list of conversations you having via text messages; itâ€™s hard to select, not easy to read. I would not even try to watch Uoutube or pornhub videos on it - donâ€™t think it could handle it"
802,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"Value for money is great (Prime Days purchase) but nothing is exceptional but phone is capable for what I've tasked it to  do. Handles calls, texts, casting videos & web surfing. Cameras are neither great nor truly ghastly, but didn't expect much & wasn't disappointed. Good phone for casual use.  One thing more; at this stage of evolution why are we still getting one star ratings posted by buyers who don't know the difference between the AT&T and Verizon universes. Good products get ripped by folks apparently oblivious to carrier protocols when Amazon gives them print space."

805,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,Striking quality! The packaging was ever so graceful. Delivery was notably swift. Seller is optimal.

808,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,Long phone. Very nice. Clear movie watching. 32gb internal storage only.
809,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"Yup, it survived being ran over on a gravel driveway. It looks and feels lanky and fragile, but it let a whole a** truck run over it no problemo. Besides that it's been a good affordable phone."
810,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"Had a motto play,I lostğŸ˜Ÿ.180 down the drain,but grabbed this for under 50.Not bad.Love the battery life.Wish it had dual speakers,but at this price point u can't go wrong."

812,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,I like this phone so much that I bought one for my sister because she needed a new one. This is a very good phone. I highly recommend it.
813,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"This phone (Tracfone Motorola moto g Pure (2021), 32GB) was a steal for $59. It may be last year's model, and it doesn't have 5G, but it did upgrade to Android 11. It's got a big display, a fairly fast CPU, and good battery life. The only down side is having to deal with Tracfone customer service. Their website is often flaky and I've gotten disconnected from their phone techs. What seems to work the best is using their online chat. They successfully switched my old phone number to this phone, and stayed with me until everything was done. Would recommend buying."
814,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,Excelente inversiÃ³n calidad precio. Desbloqueo fÃ¡cil y rÃ¡pido para usar cualquier operador
815,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"I bought this phone for my 8 year old boy caring how it would work. This thing has totally surpassed all expectations. Heâ€™s able to play his games like Minecraft and PokÃ©mon go, and the phone itself performs great. Contrary to what people are saying on here, you actually donâ€™t have to buy a plan through Amazon. We did it directly from the tracphone website and ended up saving. Only $15 a month for unlimited talk and text. Itâ€™s a great deal for a mom who wants their kid to have a phone on them, but it totally buy this for myself too. My iPhone is about to hit the fan and Iâ€™m seriously considering just buying this phone and getting a higher service plan. 10/10"
816,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"I love the phone, but after a month and unable to return the phone I begin to experience intermittent with the audio.  I could hear the person, but the person can't hear me."
817,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,It does the job

819,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"I just got this phone. In the question and answer section a tracfone rep said it does weigh a lb like the description.It does not.. it weighs 6.7oz. Who would want a phone that weighs 1lb.I can add to this once I get it set up and running.. reviews in other sites are pretty good.I returned this phone for one reason only. I have an old LGv8 phone. All of a sudden after a bad update from my small local credit union. They told me I needed a version 11 and above to work. Since it was time to get a new phone I got this Moto. The setup went easy but the app still didn't work. I was told by the person at the credit union it wouldn't work on this phone. All the other 20 or so apps are fine. The app developers on multi billion companies or less can develop apps that work. But apparently there is a reason their developer doesn't work for those big companies. They blame the phone but there is a history with this credit union since they introduced an app for devices. People were lined up in the office outside the door for help. It took more than a year to get it working on my tablet, android version 11, btw. This isn't the phone problem, it's an unqualified developer issue.So, if you don't have a problem with apps with your older phone, this phone is very nice, it works just fine aside from my problem. Nice size and the camera image is amazing.There is a nice vinyl back case for it on Amazon too."
820,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,Got this phone for my daughter. She is happy with this purchase.
821,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,The phone is great but carrier not so good safe link
822,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"Have to reboot often enough to use the cell phone service to make a call,I won't be buying another one again"
823,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,wow
824,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,It was the perfect buy for my kids to get off my phone and play on a phone similar to mine. Great features and it was successful. I'd buy again if I had to.
825,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,Its a very good phone the screen is super big worth it for a try.
826,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"I have no real complaints as far as this phone goes. I am not the most tech savvy in any way but did manage to set it up for whatever I need a cell phone for. Its capable of much more than I will ever need, however. The battery life is short in comparison to my older LG phone. I was forced to 'upgrade' due to the network changes recently so I needed a replacement that I could figure out with the least headache possible. Pics are pretty good, speed is fine. No issues when activating. So far, Im as satisfied as I can be with it."
827,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"Compared to my last phone, this one is amazing.  The only thing I don't like is that it is bigger, but I guess I will get used to it... Lol"
828,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"I had to replace my old phone and since I don't know how long I'm going to be sticking with TracFone, I decided to focus on price over features.This phone has a good price and more features than my old phone. So far, I'm very happy with the upgrade."
829,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,While in conversation the phone dial pad would randomly appear and the user's voice would be muted.  Had to hang up and call back.Other features were okay.
830,TracFone,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"This phone is great. And a great value. It has all the features I need. The only drawback for me is that it will not make calls, texts, data if I cross the border to Canada. That is the main drawback of using TracFone for me. Otherwise it is the most cost effective deal around. $60 or so for the phone and $17 a month for TracFone's basic monthly plan with autopay.  Still able to use wi-fi anywhere if it is available.Separately, maybe you all can help me :) what's the best way to get my contacts info from my other phone (LG Rebel4) that fell in water and now I can't use the screen? The phone boots up, but the screen is jacked so I can't get in.  Thanks!"
831,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"For the price, it was a great purchase. I couldn't find any scratches or marks, and it looked good as new. It also came with a screen cover, which was nice. Setup was easy. I've noticed one or two glitches but nothing that isn't common with a cr(Apple) device so it's probably just the iOS. Reboots solved the issue, just like on a brand new device.Overall, I like the phone, a lot, and I'd return to buy another from this seller if I'm in the market for it.My only critique is the battery. The description said the batteries of products were tested and met 80 percent capacity, but that was not the case. It said ""service"" as soon as I turned it on the first time, and it died immediately from ""100 percent"" after charging several hours. I purchased a battery separately at the same time because I figured it would give out sooner since it's a refurb. Still, it wasn't 80 percent; not even close. If you know how to change the battery in an iPhone then get a new battery and prepare to change it yourself. Now the phone is ""like new."""
832,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"Works great, pretty fast too. Crashed when i first booted it up but thats normal for a refurbished apple product, or just low battery aswell. No scratches, fingerprint marks or anything on the front and back, only thing is dust was along the charging port. I suggest to anyone who plans to use this as a main phone though that they buy a proper apple charger, the generic one given with it charged really slow and had issues with charging at first. The only thing i have against it really is the amount of dirt and dust, but other than that the phone works perfectly and ios16 runs great on it too."
833,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"Follow up Review: The company replaced the phone but I did have to contact them to get it done faster. I am pleased with the phone and I took off one star for the delay, just because I felt the phone should have been sent overnight automatically and because contact was difficult. I definitely think they do a nice job and would use them again.Original Review: Phone poorly packed. Bubble wrap was thin and not sealed so phone arrived half in the wrap after bouncing around inside of box. After placing SIM and powering, I discovered the touch screen didn't work. Useless. I couldn't turn the phone off, but luckily, it couldn't charge either so by the time I get it to UPS it should be dead. Waiting an additional 48 hours for a replacement, we'll see how that goes. Very disappointed after all the good reviews about this company I read."
834,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"""Refreshed"" is the new term for ""pre-owned,"" or ""refurbished,"" and if you don't need bragging rights for owning the latest and greatest high-tech device, this model of iPhone 8 might just fit the bill. Compared to the whopping prices demanded for the latest versions of the iPhone, while these are not cheap, they are certainly much more affordable, and these iPhones can perform the majority of the fancy stunts of the latest iPhones with a few differences, including having to make do with 4LTE, rather than 5G network speeds when it becomes widespread.The two iphone 8's we purchased arrived in good condition, one with a few minor screen scratches that we can live with, otherwise both intact and usable in every way, including with batteries that charged in the 90 percentile ""health"" status. The phones are unlocked and the two we received will work with both SIM cards on GSM, or on (non-SIM card) CDMA networks. We used the SIM cards from our old phones using the ""Speed-Talk"" (T-Mobile) network; these SIM cards came from cellular plans we bought from Speed-Talk on Amazon, and once the SIM cards were inserted, the phones worked perfectly.As of April 2021, the iPhone 8 supports the latest iOS operating system updates, and hopefully will remain on Apple's ""security update"" list for a number of years to come.Our experience with the two iPhone 8's, (used in conjunction with a late model Apple iPad), has us agreeing that Apple has created an excellent interlocking system for personal communications, which explains the popularity of the iPhone and its cousin, the iPad.It is worth mentioning that the function of ""iCloud,"" (Apple's server farms) which serves as a continuous (free for five gigabytes of space) backup system for your ""i""-devices; also works as a means to share notes, photos, email, calendars, and contact lists and can be accessed online using a web browser from any computer, no matter what the operating system. Appointments and contact information can also be added or modified while accessing the ""iCloud"" account from a web browser, adding a great deal of functionality to the iOS communications system. Absent from web browser access is the iOS ""Message"" presence, apparently because Apple does not want this popular message application being used or accessed on anything but ""i""-devices.The iPhone 8's were simply but sturdily packaged with a ""lightning"" charging cable and a standard USB to 110 AC adapter enclosed. Also, a tiny ""SIM card holder"" release tool was in the box, with a short prong about the diameter of a paper clip that will release the SIM card holder so you can insert your own micro SIM card into side of the iPhone. There was a walk-through brochure enclosed of how to charge and power up the iPhone, but if you are new to the methods of using one of these devices, you might want to visit YouTube where there are lots of videos about using iPhones. We had never owned ""smart-phones"" before, but we picked up the skill set easily without too much trouble or much of a learning curve. (Going through the multiple settings and options takes some time and thought, but that can be done at your leisure).With cellular networks turning off 3G and earlier network connection configurations, the iPhones were a good choice, with iOS ""message"" and ""Facetime"" options, as well as our use of a VOIP system that works through both the iPhone cellular and wireless network, allowing us to save on cellular minutes by using WiFi for sending and receiving phone calls.The ""refreshed"" iphones work well and we find they are quite handy, though we have, to date, refrained from the habit we see everywhere of people quickly pulling out their smart-phone at every opportunity and waving it around in front of their face. If we ever reach that point of insane phone-mania, we'll have to go back to using a taut string with two tin cans for our communications."
835,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"I canâ€™t believe that I can buy a refurbished iPhone in such a good condition. All parts seems and feels to be genuine, screen is flawless with true tune enabled, fingerprint sensor worked, camera, microphone gyroscope and flashlight work great. Battery health is around 88%, front and back glass are intact. Nothing to complain about this phone, feels happy to have it with just $200. Bought one refurbished iPhone 8 from another seller at about 240, and that phone even doesnâ€™t have functional microphone and speaker, more surprisingly, that phone suddenly powered off and never turns on again. Got refund on that order. I have to say this must be the best reseller, if you want to buy one refurbished iPhone, you should choose this one."
836,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"Iphone 8 arrived with lots of tiny scratches on screen and and inch long gouge. Putting a screen protector on over scratched screen doesnâ€™t seem to qualify as refurbished excellent condition. Should just say used, not refurbished if sending with scratched screen & 79% battery health, without replacing battery? Presume used phones are just checked to see if they work and sent to someone else? Asked Ray over phone for partial refund as device sent qualifies as fair condition not excellent, granted thanks.I put phone in case & can buy new battery. Worried camera occasionally freezes upâ€¦ more affordable than buying new iphone."
837,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"Just opened it today but all data transferred from old iPhone s (5) to iPhone 8 with no issues,  looks new except tiny scratch on back of phone, not screen. SIM card no problem to transfer. Weâ€™ll see how it holds up."

839,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,Never thought I would say this... I have no idea what they put on my main screen. but I've had this phone for over a year now and the back is completely trashed and broken but the front screen dose not have a scratch on it... I don't know but I feel super lucky and grateful.... its been a hell of a deal
840,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"My son accidently dropped his iPhone 10 in the pool.  He asked me for a new phone.  I mistakenly ordered the iPhone 8.  Nonetheless, the phone arrived quickly and looked brand new.  I was about to set it but my son said that it looked smaller than his drowned phone.  (It is smaller compared to the 10.)  I realized my mistake, repackaged the phone and started an Amazon refund. I assured the seller via e-mail that we had not set up the phone and that the phone was being returned in its original package.  We received a full refund upon the receipt of the phone.  Very pleased with service."
841,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"Not everyone needs a brand new iphone. You know why? Cause itâ€™s an iPhone and they last! Itâ€™s reliability backed up by Amazonâ€™s refurbished program, just sweetens the deal. Now, after 2 years by tween is still excited about her phone!"
842,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,A must buy highly recommend the phone is everything love everything about it the color is Gold real great quality the phone is exactly how it is on the app I love everything about it came with a screen protector thatâ€™s a plus again thank you Amazon ğŸ’‹
843,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"The phone stopped charging and after prolonged cleaning with a floss-pick (specifically sticking it all the way through the middle pins) it finally started working again.  Hope this helps others.  It took quite a while of cleaning as I focused on other parts of the port (because the pins looked clean, but were still blocked)."
844,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"This thing was spotless, looked and worked like new. Great beater phone for traveling and you can gift it to someone before you come home and theyll think youre a rock star"
845,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,No major issues so far. Appreciate the quality of the refurbished product.
846,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,Phone did not hold charge
847,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"I purchased this Amazon Renewed iPhone 8 to replace the one I lost over the weekend.  It was delivered one day sooner than expected, in a box containing a wall charger (didn't expect that.)  There appear to be no scratches on either front or back, and the Battery Health shows 95%.  It activated on the Verizon network with my new SIM card without any problem.  I've only had it one day, but it's much nicer than I was expecting - honestly, it looks brand new!"
848,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"This is my second ""Renewed"" iphone from Amazon, both look and work like a brand new phone, save really big bucks....."
849,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"Amazon said the battery would be at least 80%, but it was less than 20% when I got it. Other than that, itâ€™s a great phone."
850,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"Works great so far. Looked like a new phone, like it wasn't used. Overall great so far. I'll update of any changes"
851,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"Refurbishment IPhone 7 is like new.. most importantly, the battery is well over 80% as advertised. If something happened to this phone I would definitely order another from here. Highly recommended!"
852,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,My son purchased this with his own money. Came in excellent condition. No scratches at all. Phone works great. Iâ€™m about to buy another one from him
853,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"The phone works great and arrived before the expected arrival date.  The battery last less than my previous phone, but very satisfied."
854,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,Was definitely questioning this buying option. A refurbished phone from Amazon? Huh. Definitely donâ€™t regret it though!! My â€˜newâ€™ phone is amazing without a single issue - have had it for 3 months and works exactly for a VERY good price. Iâ€™ve been recommending this Amazon program to everyone
855,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,As described and arrived early. Battery health  was a little less than would have liked but overall great condition.
856,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,Got 1 for my daughter's birthday and she loves it.  Absolutely a great deal
857,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"The phone works perfectly. The battery life isn't as good as new, but this isn't a new phone.  There were no scratches or visual defects.  Everything works.  It's been a couple of years since we bought it and it is still working well."
858,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,Excellent
859,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,It's first time when I purchased a refurbished iphone and I would do it again. I'm 100% satisfied!
860,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,Basically a brand new iPhone. No scratches or scuffs. 97% battery life when you look in the settings. Canâ€™t find an issue yet!
861,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,my husband needed a phone and we don't like any of the new iphones. this one was at a great price and works well. Had it for a few months now and only a small scratch on the screen but rather then that it's golden
862,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"Love my phone, but disappointed with the battery. To be fair, it was stated that the battery life would be no lower than 80%. Mine was @ 80%. The battery canâ€™t even make it thru the day. (I am retired and not on my phone endlessly.)  I now have to buy a new battery. I think it would be better to pay a bit more for the phone (although this phone was not cheap) and have a new battery. Even though I really like my phone, my focus is on the negative due to my battery."
863,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"At the time I bought this, I almost lost trust in ""renewed"" products on amazon since I was sold an iPhone 7 that developed many issues past its return date, and when it became unusable, I had to buy this phone. 1 year later this phone is the exact same as it was when it first came on my doorstep. Battery still holds up, and no issues at all! This phone saved me from a shaky camera, not being able to use headphones, not being able to use Wi-Fi or even make calls at some point. This phone really met my expectations, and it did so very well!"
864,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"The ""Rate Features"" section asked about the FR and FR... I do NOT use the Facial Recognition or the Fingerprint Reader... totally invasive BS, IMO !!! Apart from the aforementioned... I like the phone OK, but this phone's battery lasted only 7.5 months before it became incapable of holding a battery charge at all ! I'm hoping I can use Apple's MagSafe Charger rather than having to replace the battery ? !"
865,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"When the charging port on my old iPhone SE (first generation) went bad, I needed a replacement. But what? Any new phone from Apple costs a small fortune. Yet buying a used or ""renewed"" phone from third-party suppliers is always a gamble.So with considerable trepidation, I searched Amazon for ""renewed"" options. I knew that third-party sellers' ""renewed"" phones came with an Amazon-backed 90-day guarantee. But then I discovered Amazon's ""Renewed Premium"" products. That's where hired techies put the product through rigorous restoration and (in the case of the iPhones) 20-point testing, after which Amazon offers a full year's guarantee, for any reason. That generous guarantee, and the fact that Amazon would ship the product directly, reassured me: I decided to buy only a phone covered by that ""Renewed Premium"" warranty.In choosing, I wanted a step up from the first-generation SE and the dated iPhone 7. I also wanted one whose battery could be recharged via a wireless charger, rather than those plug-in ports, which can wear out (it's happened to me twice).I settled on the iPhone 8 -- the silver model, 64 gb, fully unlocked for all carriers, and of course with the Renewed Premium guarantee. Its product page promised me ""a like-new experience."" I figured that was probably a bit of an exaggeration -- that any used/renewed phone must have SOME deficiency, if only minor cosmetic damage or a less-than-100% battery.Well, I'm thrilled to report that by ""like new,"" Amazon delivered me a renewed iPhone 8 that looks and functions as if it had just come fresh off Apple's manufacturing assembly line. I mean a gorgeous, pristine-looking phone with ZERO defects, scratches, or cosmetic blemishes on its screen, edges, or back. After swapping the SIM card from my old iPhone SE, the iPhone 8 powered right up, and -- as far as I can tell after several days of use -- it functions perfectly in every respect. Furthermore, even though Amazon only promises that the phone battery will charge to at least 90%, mine charges fully, to 100%. In short, it's a phone indistinguishable from a brand-new one -- but at a far-more-affordable price of just a few bucks over $300.Let me add that the phone wasn't casually swathed in bubble wrap and dumped into a cardboard shipping box, either. Instead, it came packaged in a sturdy ""Amazon Renewed"" box -- one that was custom-designed to hold that model iPhone, its charging cable, its wall plug, and a SIM tray opening tool. Each item was individually wrapped in plastic and fit inside its own designated slot in the box. This extra care in secure, well-designed packaging was much more than I expected.I've experienced many good transactions for a lot of great products on Amazon. However, this iPhone 8 purchase may be my best experience yet. (Okay, except perhaps for the purchase of my own thriller novels, published via Kindle Direct Publishing -- but hey, I'm biased). I eagerly recommend this particular model of the excellent iPhone 8, purchased under the ""Renewed Premium"" option. With that guarantee, there's absolutely no downside risk, and I think you can confidently expect to enjoy a truly ""like-new"" phone.--Robert Bidinotto, author,  The Dylan Hunter Thrillers Series"
866,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"Even though I purchased a renewed phone, I can't tell it from a new one and am very impressed with quality.  I didn't rate the fingerprint reader or the face recognition because I haven't (and probably won't) use those features.  The battery life is sufficient for my activities, so it gets a 5-star rating.  I don't play games or watch videos on it so far (since I'm an old geezer, lol!), but I do have a few, favorite apps I access from time to time.  If you're not really tech savvy (like me) and can't figure out how to close the apps, just google the question and you'll find the answer.  Closing the apps saves the battery, naturally.  (I read where some were complaining about the battery life and, if they're not closing the apps, this may be the culprit.)I had an old Android before and would never go back since purchasing an iPhone.  I've read the iPhone is much more intuitive to use.  Now, I have demonstrated such to myself.The camera is quite an improvement over the one in my Android.  (The Android couldn't flip the view in order to take a selfie for one thing.)  I've taken some really beautiful, true-to-color (imo) photos with the iPhone 8--comparable to my expensive (for me) Canon Rebel AND I don't have to change lenses for closeups, lol!  Phone camera seems to take care of shake automatically, too.  I'm still learning all the features of the phone (not just the camera) and will get more proficient over time.I really, really, love my ""new"" phone and wouldn't hesitate to recommend seller or purchase from them again.  This is the first time I've purchased a used phone and was a little worried about purchasing a used/renewed phone, especially over the internet.  I had absolutely no problem activating it (cell provider even gave me a free SIM card) and no malfunctions for the two weeks (now) that I've been using the phone.  The only thing I would recommend to some reviewers/buyers (who say their phone won't charge) is the plug will fit into the phone either way.  I found out it will only charge one way, however.  So, I marked that side of the plug with a dot of magic marker and have had no problem since.  (The plug in my old phone would only fit one way, so I couldn't screw up, lol!)  Also, there's a way to put the battery indicator (life percent and charging indicator) on the front of your phone (at the upper right corner).  Just google how to do this, too.  Easy-peazy!  That way, you always know if the phone is charging (by the lightning bolt on the battery symbol) and the percentage of charge.  (I think my old Android had this feature on the front as a default.  I had to direct the iPhone to do this.  That's not a complaint.  There may be others reading this who may not know they have to do this, either, if they want it on their front screen.)"
867,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"I did have to purchase a new SIM card. But overall great purchase for me, a 256GB model for $139. The battery life is rated at 90% also. I will add some pictures later showing how great the phone looks."
868,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,Arrived within the time I expected and it does everything that my old phone did if not a little better.
869,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"I always get iPhone products because they are never a letdown. This phone is good quality and holds a charge for about 2 days with a little less than  average daily use. The screen is smaller than I like but the clarity and resolution is perfect even for watching a movie. One problem I have is the on/off ringer swith, it's a turn style nob instead of a push button. Its a little hard to grip and turn,  so no wonder they ditched this nov in the later models, even they knew it was a fail"
870,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,Works great
871,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,Just got it yesterday. Too soon to tell about battery.  It was fully charged when it arrived. Fingerprint reader worked.
872,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"The battery was Weak & grains faster, I Would Like to change the iPhone 8"
873,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,Phone came in new condition and works well. The only downside was the screen scratched very easily. Idk if it was replced with an aftermarket or something but overall a good buy.
874,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"I had my iPhone 6splus go out. I was trying to get something similar in size. I wasn't big on getting the newest and most to date phone because its really expensive.  I purchase a Apple 7 from here. It came no scratches, beautiful screen. I would had been super happy. But I could not get T mobile to service the phone. I think it was T mobile being lazy. I had to send this phone back and wait for a refund. The seller was helpful in every-way. Understood my issue why I had to return it. Issued me a full return with no hassle. Thank you, for tying to help. 5* as promised."
875,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"Overall, the look is good, although there are one or two noticeable scratches on the screen. There's a bit of aging at the corners of the screen. Battery health is 79%, which is just below 80%, but it is acceptable considering the price is a bit lower for 256GB than 128GB iPhone8. It's still waterproof (not tested underwater completely)."
876,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,This product was what I expected
877,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"I was very anxious about buying online again. Last phone (within 60 days) was horrible. This phone so far has me pleasantly surprised. Pros: not one scratch or crack, very fast processingCons: The battery ğŸ”‹ is only %74 (when it was promised 80% or better) and the SIM card slot didnâ€™t fit inside all the way.I had to used the sim slot piece from a previous phone. But it did work thank goodness if not this would have been another Amazon fail. But I was able to save it myself. Just beware. Any changes will update."
878,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,"Pretty good so far, got here earlier the. Expected, battery life at 95%, getting the newest 16.03 update took a little but itâ€™s an older phone so I didnâ€™t mind it. It was for my father and heâ€™s happy, aswell as I. Great condition no scratches, doesnâ€™t get better than this, definitely recommending to friends if anyone needs a new phone"
879,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,I originally thought this was the 8plus really need to fix you alls descriptions. I shouldnâ€™t be able to type in 8plus n get the 8ğŸ¤¦ğŸ¾â€â™‚ï¸ğŸ˜©ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£but my daughter loves it.
880,Apple,IPhone 8,64 GB,Ios,4.7 Inches,Works great
881,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"I ordered it on Sept 20th at $339 plus shipping of ~$34 and Morocco VAT of ~$80, so totally I paid $449.Delivery was very good. I saw it was shipped on the 25th. On the 30th, I received an SMS from DHL saying they planned delivery on Oct. 3rd, but on the same day I got an email asking for copy of national ID and content description for clearing customs. I am not a Morocco residents nor citizen, so I sent my foreign passport instead. On the 3rd, Amazon tracking info said clearing custom was delayed as additional documents were needed. So I called DHL, and the rep said it would be delivered on the 4th instead. On the 4th, I saw a newly posted message about delay on Amazon tracking. I called DHL various times but couldn't get to anyone. I then sent an inquiry by email and get a response shortly saying it was being taking care of. Then late afternoon, I got the package.Upon arriving, the seal of the packing had an opening large enough to put in a hand but not for getting the phone out, so I didn't complain.Unpacked, the inner packing of the phone was in excellent condition, very much like the original packing but had no Samsung marking, rather, it had a marking of ""amazonrenewed"". There was a film covering the screen, like on a new phone. The phone appeared in excellent condition, only had a small scratch at the back when I looked in detail, and a hair of scratch on the screen that is only visible under bright light and in a particular angle. I tried but couldn't turn on the phone - there was no response. The box also included a USB-C cable and a cheap non-Samsung charger made in China. I used my own Samsung Charger to charge the phone. After plugged in, it showed the battery was at 0. So I let it charge to full.After started, it turned out fully unlocked. My Morocco sim card works with 4G. The phone's software looked already reset, but I reset it myself anyhow. Then updated to the latest system with Android 12, and loaded many apps I need. During about the first week, the battery appeared quite poor. With medium usage it lasted about a day. I tried all necessary settings to conserve battery, but it didn't seem to help much. These couple days, it becomes much better, lasting about 45 hours. I read it was likely due to some AI processes either from Android 12 or Samsung doing the learning work at first.Â  But it's pretty bad the phone doesn't show any info.I would say I am very happy with the phone. And this is after having a terrible experience in the past with Samsung.The last Samsung phone I had was S7 Edge bought in Thailand (I am a traveler), new at a Samsung store for perhaps ~$800. I actually wanted the normal S7 (without the ""edge""), but it was out of stock then. I never liked the ""edge"", it was a silly design in my mind. The phone worked well initially, but in the coming couple of years I had a terrible experience. About 5 months later when I was in Vietnam, the screen started to show shaded bands across. As I was wondering how or if I should return to Thailand to get the phone serviced, the bands disappeared after a month. Then about another 7 months later when I was in Azerbaijan, the phone couldn't start after I did a system update. So I couldn't use the phone for a couple weeks until I reached Tbilisi in GeorgiaÂ  when I had someone flashed it.Â  About a year later, it died on me again when I was in Morocco. I had someone re-flashed it, but it was not successful.Â  About 1 month later I reached the city of Fes where there is a Samsung service center.Â  After checking, they said there was something wrong with the motherboard. Very shocking!Â  I've never had such problem in my life with all the phones and computers, cheap or dear, and this was a flagship!Â  So eventually, I sold it to a local repair shop for $200, for which they said they only needed the screen. That was end of 2017.So I never bought a Samsung again, and would definitely not buy one at the full price. I admit the S series is not worthless.Â  At least, I like the camera.Â  But I never had a chance to buy one at a largely reduced price (I won't buy from just any second-hand sellers).So now, the Amazon reviewed phone with some warranty got me interested. Yes, I have some risk, but to me with the past experience, the risk is not much higher than getting a new phone from Samsung, plus, I am putting in a much lower bet now."
882,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,I absolutely love this phone the only problem I have with it is when I first bought it I didn't realize until later that it was connected to T-Mobile which wasn't a big problem since I already have T-Mobile as my provider but that's something I would look out for it works really well the camera is one of the best I've ever had which is something I use a lot of. It pretty much runs all day for me but just know that sometimes the battery can drain a little quicker than normal so if you don't have any problem with that I would go with it also it runs a lot faster than my little Samsung a20 which is a huge upgrade for me and it runs really good on games as well just very happy with this phone and hopefully this helps everybody else
883,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"The phone is as stated in addHowever  the battery discharge is rapid and I find that I have to recharge several times per day with regular use. I reduced the refresh rate from 120 to 60 and that has helped. Also after several days of frustration  over not getting 5g  coverage and almost sending the phone back, I learned that the carrier is not able to  provide 5 g coverage on the bring your own plan!!!"
884,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"The phone when bought in excellent condition, like it states, is in excellent condition. It's practically brand new. The phone, camera, and pixel density are improved from my previous older model of this phone. My only critique is that it slightly confusing whether you should factory reset the phone manually or if it's already been done for you. The box has a paper stating how to factory reset the phone, so I reset the phone."
885,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,Overall a pretty good deal for the price but a few things to note:1. The included charging cable is not an OEM Samsung part and it doesn't even work with the phone properly. I attached a picture of the message that appears when using this charger.2. Noticable scratches on the side rails but the screen is fine. No biggie if you plan to use a case.
886,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,The phone seems to be working well... the screen and phone are in good condition... I only gave it 4 stars because it was dirty in the cracks all around the screen and I had to kinda pick it out... besides that all in all a good phone.
887,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"I purchased this phone, as in very good condition, well, let me say it looked new.  Having said that, after a couple of weeks I did have an issue with the SIM reader, contacted Amazon, which had me in contact with RE -CELL and they immediately sent me a return label, and within two working days I had the replacement, a beautiful, white, S-21 better than excellent, brand new, the works.  So glad that Amazon has RE-Cell as a product provider, their work is excellent.  I highly recommend it.  I have purchased refurbished phones in the past, but this experience not only strengthens my faith in doing so, but also has made me a customer for life of RE-CELL."
888,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"It's quite new, comes with a screen protector, but has obvious seams on the back, needs to be charged frequently, and the most important, it's single sim, every one tends to buy it should be conscious about that."
889,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,It didn't let me my face recognition.  My finger print reader sometimes doesn't work. The battery sometimes  the life is to short.
890,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,I was quite nervous ordering a renewed phone thinking I would be getting someone else problems.  It how ever has worked out really great.  The phone is much faster than I was used to.  It has more memory than my old one and It looks very much like brand new.  Very happy with this phone.
891,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"This phone is definitely an upgrade from my previous phone. A lot more functionality. Bought as ""Renewed"", but in very good physical condition and operating condition. Disappointed about no aux input for headphones, and no SD card slot. Also, the battery life drops relatively faster than my previous phone. Overall, quite happy with my purchase though."
892,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"At least my phone came with an excellent condition, I didn't find any scratches on the screen or at the back, it's unlocked as it said, the only negative thing that I found is that it came with the USB cable, but not with the adapter as the publication said and also the battery life isn't the best."
893,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"I love this phone because it's light and the camera is very good. I was bit disappointed when I received it because the screen was smaller than what I was expecting (I didn't check the size before ordering) for the rest the pink color is really pretty and the phone works perfectly. It was like new, no scratches. The battery lasts around 1 day, 1 day and a half"
894,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"This phone was renewed & supposed to be in excellent condition. Showed up brand new with no scratches, no flaws on any kind. All Samsung diagnostic tests showed everything working perfectly. I'm impressed with seller & fast shipping & the quality of this phone. T-Mobile store transferred all my data & said phone seemed brand new to them. I will definitely buy from this seller again !!"
895,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,The fingerprint reader takes a little practice as my previous phone was a galaxy s10e and the reader was on the side. In my opinion this is simpler and more efficient than having it on the side.
896,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"This is my first flagship phone I have ever owned. It took sometime to get here, but when I got it I was surprised to see that it was a unlocked Verizon phone. It was unexpected, but ok since it was indeed fully unlocked. The phone arrived in excellent condition. There was a small scratch on the lower left portion of the phone. But since its a refurbished unit, was fine with me. The phone build quality is super nice. Feels like a flagship, and looks the part as well. I don't mind if it's last year's flagship. The snapdragon 888 coupled with 8gb of ram makes it snappy and responsive, The camera is most excellent. With the 30x telephoto main lens, delivers crisp clear pictures. With the camera zoomed in all the way (as seen in the picture I posted with this review) is fantastic. I have tried to take pictures of the moon with other phones but it just comes out a blurred mess. Sound quality is good with the dual speakers it has. It also has Dolby Atmos, which is a huge plus. The battery however is only 4000 mah which is good to get the average person through the day, but being a delivery driver it lasts about 3/4 of a day before I have to put it on a charger. The display is 120hz display, but can be scaled down to 60hz manually , or can be set for automatic. Last but not least, the price. The price was unbeatable. Mid $300.00 price range for a phone that is still a flagship is unbeatable. So too sum it all up, awesome phone, even better price makes this the best investment I have ever made"
897,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"Great value, good buy.  I hope to get at least 4 years out of this phone as the current generation is only one off (as of October 2022)."
898,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"We purchased two of these S21 models in ""excellent"" condition, one grey and one violet.  We've only had them a few days, but they're working perfectly.The grey one is totally mint.  Not a mark on it.  The violet one has some micro scratches on the bezel, but since the bezel is a shiny metallic gold, that's to be expected.  If that bothers you, go for the grey.  The violet is an interesting color, not as pastel as you would expect.This is a great value on a great phone.BTW - yes, they were both unlocked.  Popped in our SIM cards and worked just fine.  LOVE that there's no bloatware!"
899,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"The phone is in good condition, with just one small scratch on the body and a little bit dirty, but have a good battery (97%) so for this money very good phone I'm happy."
900,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"After spending a day with my ""new used"" S21, I am very happy with it. I live in the Southeast and use C Spire, a smaller carrier, so I was a little apprehensive about this phone's true ""unlocked"" status, but I popped the SIM in, and the device was immediately up and running. No worries there. Between that and the native software to transfer contacts, texts, etc, the transition beteen my old Galaxy and this one was quick and seemless. The phone itself is gorgeous. The deep colors, that awesome refresh rate, video, scrolling, all good stuff and why I'm a Galaxy S dude. I can tell with just a little experimenting that the camera is pretty good too, though I'm not much of a photographer. Having said that, the few unskilled snapshots I've taken look pretty danged nice. The battery life, eh. Not quite as good as my old S9+, at least in the first couple of years of that phone's life, but not as horrible as some reviews make it out to be. After a fair amount of YouTube, browsing, and adding apps, lasting the day wasn't a problem. I think most will be good with it. My only complaint: Amazon says these refurbs are sold in like new condition. And this is the third S I've bought renewed from Amazon, and have had *zero* problems until this little bugaboo. This is one great phone, and overall looks pretty new, but there is what appears to be a little chip in the bezel on the left side. It isn't hugely noticeable, but it certainly is there, and is discolored compared to the metal around it.  I would really describe the phone as more in excellent condition than like new, but by no means would I call this a deal-breaker, but  it does make me feel like I spent a little more on the phone than I should have. But, you know, the horror stories I've seen in other reviews have not been my experience on go-round number three, so all in all it's not the worst thing ever."
901,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,I bought this phone because I need to replace a refurbished S20 that I had just bought from a different seller. The last phone wasn't actually unlocked and the seller was not pleasant. Anyway this phone came early and FULLY unlocked!! All I had to do was put my Sim card in it and it was ready to use! The paint in the back had a minor defect but it's not a big deal. I'm very happy with this product and would buy from this seller again!
902,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"I ordered an S21 from seller thegadgetdeals and paid $339 before taxes. The device came in a generic box with a real Samsung charging brick, a brand new USB cable, and SIM tool. The device was nicely packed with a plastic film cover on the screen. It needed a little wipe down, but upon doing so there was very little if any marks indicative of use. It powered right up and I verified it as a real G991U1, factory unlocked US model S21 phone from Samsung.Accubattery showed approximately 86% of charge capacity, which is a bit of a bummer on a phone with an already smaller battery, but if it proves an issue I will just get a new battery which will make it pretty much as good as new. It is above Amazon's 80% guarantee, so no points lost here.No display or camera damage, and everything looks and works good. I can't complain one bit. If anything, I think Amazon should have packaged the box better, as they didn't even put a single air bag in the box, so the phone's box was able to be thrown around within during transit. Luckily, this didn't affect mine at all.A good practice when buying from Amazon Renewed is to research the seller's ratings. Keeping in mind that most people only make reviews when things go wrong, if a seller has very little to no negative reviews, I say buy. You get 90 days to return it if anything goes wrong, after all. Quit overthinking it, and just do it."
903,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"I ordered two phones, one charcoal and one pink. They both were in excellent condition and work and look absolutely perfect!"
904,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,Haven't had any problems so far but then it has only been about a month. Worst part is figuring out where the apps I used to use on my last phone are.
905,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"I was very hesitant to purchase a refurbished phone.  But, I wanted the Samsung Galaxy S21 for the camera.  It does not disappoint.  It was easy to connect to my Tracfone account and transfer existing plan totals.  It functions very well for what I use a smartphone."
906,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"Came very quickly with free 2 day shipping, in original box with all accessories!!! Very worth the price"
907,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"The phone looks new and functions great. No problem unlocking with my carrier, T-Mobile. I had the S20 and am very pleased with the upgrade and definately with the price. Even the guy at Samsung, who I had to go thru for one unlocking step, was impressed with the price."
908,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,Excellent phone in all regards.  Looked and performs like new.  Super easy setup and transfer from Moto G7.  When I first powered up it said T-Mobile but as soon as I inserted my Verizon sim it changed the banners and connections to Verizon.  Totally satisfied.
909,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,Love the phone but was not compatible with my phone service.
910,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"When purchasing anything I look at all the bad reviews to prepare myself for the worst so I wasn't too excited until I got my phone and realized it truly is in excellent condition. No scratches at all, no cracks on the screen, the camera is amazing, the mic works perfectly, the battery charges to 100% but real capacity is 95%. There's only a 182.8 difference on the battery's mAh. My last phones (galaxy a51) refresh rate was so slow and I didn't even know it, everything loads so quickly and no more lagging! I don't have to wait for my camera to load anymore, no more missing shots. Time will tell with more wear but so far I love it and I cannot tell that this was ever a used phone."
911,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"Phone looks new, delivered twice as fast as prediction (Arrived 36 hours after ordering)Everything works perfectly.Highly recommend this seller"
912,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"If you are going to buy a re-burbished phone, make sure the seller is Re-Cell. Because of the 5g switch with AT&T my phone would not make phone calls. However, I did not know this was the issue and no one could help me get my phone working. For 2 weeks I didn't have a phone. However, within 1/2 hour of contacting Re-Cell, they provided the information I needed, and I now have a perfect phone.Re-Cell provides excellent customer service, willingness to help, information, fast response and the offer to replace my phone even though it was not their issue. I was extremely nervous buying a refurbished phone for the first time and had it not been the AT&T 5g issue, I would have been immediately happy with my purchase. I made sure I purchased through Re-Cell based on previous reviews and am so thankful that I did.READ FURTHER IF YOU ARE HAVING ISSUES WITH YOUR NEW 5G PHONE. Go to AT&T's website. (I had not done this because I never thought of it because I was working with Consumer Cellular-who should have known all this). According to AT&T's website, the phone I had should still work.; Galaxy S21 5G (G991U*, G991U1, G991W, G991B, G991B/DS). My phone is G991u1. However, if you go further, the website also indicates that a software update may be needed. My last software update had been on March 23, 2022 and my phone was set to automatic updates so I figured I was all updated. Regardless, I manually clicked on updates and found out that there was indeed an update. After 3 hours to download and install, my phone now makes calls and works perfectly.So, here are things you may want to try if your phone won't make calls:  1. Check your phone on AT&T's website (not just your provider). Check to see if your phone should still work on AT&T's 5g. (According to AT&T, Galaxy S21 5G (G991U*, G991U1, G991W, G991B, G991B/DS) should work. My phone is G991u1. However, go further to see if a software update may be needed.  2. Do not rely on automatic updates on your phone but manually check for updates. Install the update if available.I am a happy customer thanks to Re-Cell. Make sure you buy from them."
913,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,Haven't had long enough to really review.
914,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"No signs whatsoever of repairs or use. Works just as a new phone , very nice phone. Will buy again !"
915,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,Quality fast working phone.like the size the of the phone.facial and finger print recognition works fast and correctly every time. No regrets. Overall best phone I've ever owned
916,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"The seller brought this phone to like new status. It was beautifully restored,  I am happy with this purchase."
917,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"Ordered 2 phones. I'm pretty sure both had their screens replaced and as a result, neither had a working fingerprint scanner so I sent them back. One was pretty poorly replaced and had an air bubble behind the glass that great reduced image quality. Other than that, they performed like they were brand new. But the camera is terrible in anything past a 3x zoom. For 150 more you can get a renewed s21 ultra and it's just a much better phone all around"
918,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"This is a major upgrade for me as I had a Samsung Note 8 before this phone and really love this phone! It does everything with speed and precision. It even has a ton of customization features, more so than what's offered on the iPhone in my opinion and for a fraction of the price! Highly recommend this phone to anyone who needs an unlocked Smart Phone!"
919,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,Great seller and phone.
920,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,This phone works like new looks like new its new! Awsome deal!
921,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"Calling this phone ""renewed"" is a false advertisement. It should be called used. I pretty much got someone else's used up phone with several cosmetic imperfections like burn-in on the display, scratches and nicks on the metal frame, and a scuffed up back panel looking like someone dragged it on concrete. But as far as internal functions, everything works perfectly. No problems with the USB-C Port, display function, camera function, fingerpeint sensor function, and the speakers also perform very well. And it is also unlocked to any carrier which is great."
922,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"Phones arrived in 1 day, a day before it was supposed to arrive. Minimal scratches and all in working condition."
923,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,I'm just gonna start off by saying I love the phone. I've had is since Feb and have had no problems. But as of latley while in a call it cuts out and I only get every other word. It's weird because when I use fb messenger for calls there is no cut out. I don't know if others have had this problem. It's very frustrating.
924,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,Phone came in like it was new. It was white and there no scratches at all. Will buy again
925,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,My husband has been using it for a week or so now and no problems at all. Looked practically brand new when it arrived. We will use this vendor to replace my phone as well.
926,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,Todo bien
927,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,S21 is exactly what was described. Opened the box and it looked like a new phone.
928,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,Excellent condition!! love it.
929,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,LlegÃ³ en perfecto estado . Tal cual parece nuevo . Y funciona perfectamente si recomiendo comprarlos por este medio .
930,SAMSUNG,S21,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"Few scratches, but functionality 100% very happy with purchase!"
931,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"I needed to get another phone for my daughter whose corner screen was cracked as well as the back.  I sent it in to Samsung to be fixed under a promotion and they then tried to charge for an lcd screen.  The cost rose from 117 to 280.  The phone actually works perfectly, save for the small cracked area on the bottom corner, but we wanted to replace the cracked screen under the promotion.  Anyhow, I am still working with Samsung about this as they claim they always replace the lcd screens on s10's when replace the front screen.  Which is fine, if you honor the promotion price you offered.So, for less than the cost of paying samsung to refurbish our phone, I had them send it back at no charge to us and found this ""renewed"" s10 for less cost.  So now we will still have my daughter's phone, which works fine, minus the crack, and this new/renewed model.  It will be nice to have a backup for my kids.Now for the review:First, I often read reviews where people complain about the seller, but do not list the seller.  So what good does that do?  So, up front, the seller I used was Edge Cellular while the order was fulfilled by Amazon.  The phone I ordered said it was for T Mobile, but the seller said it was unlocked and would work with any gsm network.  I could have paid just a little less for a fully unlocked phone not made specifically for my carrier, but I did not want to chance any issues.  I asked about both the T Mobile and the fully unlocked phones and the seller said the fully unlocked would work on T Mobile.  So it was just my peace of mind that caused me to stick with the T Mobile version.  The seller was extremely fast in his answers by the way.  That was nice.I have uploaded several pictures to show the phone and the contents.The phone arrived the next day as promised.  So speedy deliveryThe phone arrived in a plain white box with the phone information listed on the side.An Amazon renewed pamphlet was included.The accessories in the box included everything we received when we originally purchased our new Samsung Galaxy S10's, minus the tool used to remove the sim card.  That is fine as you can just use a small paper clip.  All the accessories are samsung products.  I was surprised by this, but pleasantly. I have used them and they all work as expected.  I have used the included fast charger and the earbuds.  Both worked perfectly.The Phone is immaculate.  If I did not know any better, I would say the phone was brand new.  I saw no scratches or marks on the front, the back, or the sides.  I checked and I do not believe the included screen protector that Samsung provides on their new phones is on this one, unless they have not made it impossible to tell if it is on.  But I do not believe that is the case.  So, no screen protector.I have been using the phone now for a few hours.  I went ahead and put in my sim card and set up the phone with my account to make sure it is all functional.  I tested the main things I could think of and I will explain below:* The powered on to the T Mobile screen just like my other phones.* I have charged the phone 2 different times so far, and the phone charged just fine.  It charged quickly and charged to 100%.  I allowed the phone to discharge, which was slow and the same as my old phone, and recharged.  I did not notice any perceivable heat on the phone during charging.  As I just received the phone today, I cannot give a definitive statement concerning the battery life yet.  But I do not see any difference in the discharge of this phone compared to my old one.  If that changes, I will update my review as appropriate.* The screen is perfect.  I played video, took pictures, ran some apps, ran through some settings such as face recognition and finger print scanner.  Everything I did worked great.  So the screen seems to have absolutely no issues.* The settings and different functions I did use all worked without fail.  I used the audio for both bluetooth and corded ear buds.  No problems.  The sound was great.  The wifi works great.  I hooked up to the T Mobile Network immediately without issue.  I was able to immediately make calls.  I did use the video calling and it worked, but had pixilation which I had on my new phones anyway.  I took both pictures and video and they worked perfectly.  The messaging works perfectly.  I sent photos to see and no issues.  I used the voice recorder and it worked.  I signed into my google account and it automatically downloaded my contacts and music.  I downloaded an app from the Galaxy Store and it works fine.So, in conclusion or TLDNR version, the phone is exactly as described and may as well be a new phone.I would recommend Edge Cellullar.  I did make sure to choose the phone that was fulfilled by Amazon, so keep that in mind.  That said, if you use Edge Cellular and choose a phone fulfilled by Amazon, I would feel very confident you will receive an extremely nice product.  You may very well get a great phone, even if not fulfilled by Amazon.  I am just letting you know how I purchased the phone so you can make an informed decision."
932,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"Overall, I like the S10. It way outclasses other cheap-end Samsung devices, even ones that are brand new. Honestly, it is still so advanced that you can't tell that it is several years old. Love it.PROS:Great phone in beautiful condition. Looked brand new when I got it. Most advanced Samsung model that I have had to date. Love the fingerprint reader, face recognition and speed. All of that works flawlessly. Takes great pictures, I really like the scan option. Fantastic speaker. Easy to find cases for it. Charges really quick too. Trade-in value was the big seller for me. Old flagship devices tend to have a better trade-in value than the cheapo models.CONS:As can be expected with it being refurbished, the battery life is not the best. After 1 day from a full charge, I am down to about 50-40%. I like the phone, so I may get that replaced later on.Another major issue, that is a problem with many devices with fingerprint readers is finding decent looking screen protectors. I went with a plastic film screen cover for a while, until it got bubbled up pretty badly. I just have my otterbox on it now with no screen cover.Last and most obvious problem is that this device was not originally unlocked. It was originally sold as a t-mobile phone, from what I can tell when I send emails. Whenever I start it up, I always get a device setup screen that appears. It can be removed by hitting the minimize button at the bottom of the screen, but it is an annoyance. I got with my phone carrier, Straight Talk, to get it removed, but I could not. It was just an error on the device. Initially, I also had some problems with both texting. This was eventually resolved by using only Verizon towers, on GLOBAL.VERDICT:While it is a top notch phone, there are some things about it that could be better. I would have preferred that the refurbishers had taken some time to make sure that it worked 100% flawlessly before sending it to me. I will still keep it, as it works great beyond these issues, but it will not get my 5-stars rating because it was not perfect."
933,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"Phone arrived several days ahead of est delivery, works great, being refurbished there are several cosmetic defects but the screen is new. I am not impressed with the less than stellar battery life. The phone arrived with an 85% charge. In the time it took to set up the phone, approx 30 mins, it was down to 35%. The battery health tested @ 75% of original capacity. In the time it has taken to write this review its drained 5%"
934,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,I am so satisfied with this refurbished phone. No physical flaws and no problem with the function of the phone. I do not have to put my face recognition or finger print so I can not comment on those two features. This is second refurbished phone I have purchased and I have been very satisfied with both with no problems. 1st one is almost 2 years old and the newer one is 9 months old.
935,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"HabÃ­a comprado un S10 PLUS hace poco pero lo cambiÃ© por este porque no me gustan los celulares grandes, y el otro al igual que este son un poco imprecisos en el GPS, funciona bien, pero es un poco impreciso. Por lo demÃ¡s, es una muy buena compra, lo recomiendo totalmente, cÃ³mo el plus como este, aunque bueno, a veces la huella falla, falla con frecuencia."
936,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"The phone looks good. The hole for the headphone was so full of lint that the headphones wouldn't stay plugged in. We cleaned it out and now it works fine. The charging cord and the box are both junk. We tried them on 3 phones , just to make sure it wasn't a charging problem with this phone. It gives an error message and slow charging message."
937,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,Bit more dinged up then I would have liked but it works and nothing broken!
938,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,It works perfectly. It has a few scuffs but otherwise excellent condition but mine did come with a bit of grime on the metal surrounding rhe phone but no big deal.
939,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"I bought this phone for testing and development for work applications. The phone itself was in great condition. I got a Samsung charger and USB-C to USB-A cable and it charges the phone very fast. For a renewed product, I was very happy with my purchase. The phone was in perfect condition. I honestly could not tell if the phone was previously owned. Best decision to save money and get a quality product. Plus, it keeps technology from landing in a landfill or similar."
940,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,Battery drains way faster than my last phone.last the whole day on average but if u listen to music or play videos you will be charging by 5 o'clock.phone is fast.screen is vivid.takes amazing photos.just battery life and it's feels dainty.i bought a heavy duty case for it and I like it alot more
941,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"I was so hesitant ordering this and saw a few bad reviews. Out of my surprise, it was very difficult to differentiate from a new one. There was no visible cosmetic damages or dent. Everything works perfect without any issues. I wish they would at least send a nice packet other than the Amazon renewed package. The phone comes with aftermarket charger but that works well. I would recommend this phone."
942,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"For ~$225, this phone is a good value. I use this phone for editing photos and updating text documents. Works fine without any issue. The camera is also very sharp, even in low lighting. I would buy this phone again, however I am leaning towards the S20."
943,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"Holy crap, I'm so impressed. Arrived a day early, packaged like new, zero marks or scratches anywhere. I connected it to my old phone with a severely cracked screen and was able to transfer everything my apps.I was quoted $230 to repair my broken screen, so I thought getting a refurbished phone for less was worth it, and I'm SO glad I did! This phone works perfectly, looks beautiful, great battery life, came with a like-new charger. Absolutely 100% recommend!"
944,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"Very good condition. Battery last long. Except a few scratches at the bottom of the phone,almost like new.  Only problem is finger print recognition was good before the screen protector but not so good after putting screen protector.P.S. FedEx delivered to a wrong house and marked as delivered. My neighbor left it at the front door next day."
945,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,It is an oled panel so it makes sense that it takes more battery but it runs down a little fast. Face recognition only really works for me when it isn't dark. Overall a good phone for the low price.
946,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,Looks good. The phone is as good as new
947,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"I moved from LG to samsung due to my screen breaking(Still completely functional) and It was hard to find a authentic screen replacement So, I decided to move to Samsung phones with their SD card slots still available.It works as intended and no scratches or anything when received for me atleast. Set up was easy, but hadto update like 15+ different software updates for it to finally work with my cellular provider sim card. All the software and hardware features worked as intended. The fingerprint sensor took me a couple tries to get it to detect the setup, but that's because it's wants you to do it a extremely specific way. When transferring my data with the (Samsung Switch app) to transfer. It put all my data from SD card and mostly internal storage in order from my older LG phone to the New SD card on this new phone. The Samsung app is kind of buggy. So, I had reinstall it a few times to work.  Android Software is similar or not to far off from my old LG phone. So, I was practically familiar with some of the features. Overall for me, this is a good phone to have for the time being. Will update the Star rating if anything unexpected changes."
948,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"I took a chance and bought a ""less than excellent"" refurbish. Frankly, it looks as good as the last one, which was rated ""excellent"". I'm very happy with this replacement...buying this was cheaper than a screen replacement for the old one!"
949,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,Great phone for the money was as advertised and arrived on time
950,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"the phone is very good, battery life is very good. overall the phone is in excellent condition"
951,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,The quality is good..lots of memory space
952,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"As someone who is gravitationally challenged, it was only a matter of time before I broke my phone.  This replacement had me up and running in short order.  Given cost of new phones with features I or most people don't really need (for example Eleventy Billion pixel resolution and 20 cameras), I will be purchasing refurbished in the future."
953,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,Best budget phone in 2022. Had s7 for years finally upgraded on the cheap
954,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"Came with the appearance of a new phone. I suppose it has a very good battery, I've had no disappointment so far. I have not regretted at any time that I bought this phone. This is the closest ,I could come to having a new one. At this price, I can upgrade 5 times for the price of a new one. I recommend."
955,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"For a such price, the phone is really good!!!Recommended!"
956,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"Bought this phone a couple of months ago from the seller flipcells. I was worried that it would come broken like some of the reviews on here say. When it came it looked fine other than some scratches by the charging port. When I plugged it in with the charger that came with the phone, it showed a charging error and that is would take over 24 hrs to charge. WHich is soo slow that you can't even use the phone while it's plugged in. Got a new charger and it worked great.TLDR: Great other than it came with a broken charger."
957,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,Good value for the money ğŸ’°.  I bought it at a discount.
958,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"Phone works well, battery dies a little quicker than my A50 but all features works and look like brand new."
959,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,There's nothing overly bad to say except that the phone could have been cleaned better before resell. The charging block that was sent did not work but I have my old one that does.
960,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,A great phone and a good value
961,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,Saturday night 10 September 2022:I have the Samsung Galaxy 10 phone. It appears okay and I do not have any complaints about it thus far.I turned it on and added all of my songs and photos on it.I can Not fully rate it yet because it my back up phone.  I will not be using it now.My regular phone is a Samsung Galaxy 20.

968,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,Phone is nice .feels good. Features ok. But two weeks after camera stopped working. Choice of returing or delete and factory restore. Which I did .lost some of my pictures and stuff..now so far so good.
969,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,I had to use this phone because the phone I got which was fairly new got stolen. This phone is pretty capable that I don't think I will upgrade for a while. I like the fact that there is a headphone jack and I can still use a micro SD card.
970,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,This phone is perfect! Refurbished phone works as if it was brand new! I would order from them again.
971,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"Bought two phones from this seller and both are in great condition. One phone already had a screen cover on it while the other did not. Not one scratch on the screens or back, but could tell they were used due to extremely minor and barely visible imperfections on the corners that was easily covered up with a phone case. Both phones unlocked as advertised.When it comes to the phone itself, it's a pretty major upgrade from the 9+ I had. The only thing I don't like about this phone is the fingerprint reader: it has a hard time detecting my finger on the screen even with major calibrations and is not as efficient as the previous phone. I ended up turning off the reader since it took too long to unlock my phone more times than not. Wish they would've kept it on the back of the phone in an obvious and dedicated area, but other than that, I love this phone"

974,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,"Bought this phone a few days ago and got it registered on the Boost Mobile network without any issues, although you'll probably have to take it to your local store to get it setup.I love this phone it's a flagship! It has all the features, all the quality, and performance you could possibly want for only $200 bucks? That's a steal! The phone came and it's literally brand new there's only the tiniest scratch on the bottom of the bezel, but other than that there was nothing wrong with it. The screen is a gorgeous OLED, nice saturated colors, and bright. Touch sensitivity is accurate and perfect, you'll never miss a keystroke because of the phone's fault. It has an AUX port and SD card support... enough said.If your looking for a new fully unlocked flagship phone for cheap? Buy this phone! Just make sure it's delivered by Amazon so you can get their full 90-day warranty. Cheers."
975,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,Phone works great. This is for my high school grandson and it's an excellent phone and works great.

979,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S10,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.1 Inches,I love my phone it works great so far no problem hopefully it remains the same! Great purchase

981,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"My Moto Power G 2020 was working fine, but the screen was stuttering - I'd do something and it took up to a second and a half to respond. Some app I installed is loading down the input queue - I know because I have an identical phone with most the software installed on it as well, and it works fine. (Doubt it's a physical hardware problem, but it's possible.)I fiddled with it and tried and gave up, and bought this a stylus 5G  instead. The Power is 4/64G, this stylus is 8/256G with a better CPU, so lots more effective space. Throwing money and hardware at the studdering problem fixed it, of course, I also added a 1T SD card, the older one supported 512G.The Power has the same 5A battery, but lasts 2 days routinely. This one last a full day, but most of the power is going for the screen. Still, good enough. The stylus is mono (!) while the Power is stereo; the stylus power switch itself doubles as the fingerprint reader while the older Power device had it placed on the top middle of the back.It's handy to have it on the power switch, but also slightly annoying at times. I think I prefer on the back actually; at times pushing the button to turn it off seems to activate the fingerprint reader which turns it right back on again. (Probably just me, but be aware.)It's got a built in stylus and 5G; don't know that I've used either of these. It works just fine without it. Both of them have 3.5 mm - thank you Motorola!It's got NFC while the older Power doesn't - I don't use that either (yet) because I don't want my phone to be a credit card. I'm a Luddite, maybe I'll go out of it someday. Since I'm over 60 it'd better be soon.I like it a lot, even though I could have fixed my older Power unit. I think the camera is about the same, if not ever so slightly worse. Not sure though, and I'm not a camera buff and don't really care as long as I can recognize who's in it.Remember that both Google and Apple are always helping out and watching though -- search the news for ""dad picture son doctor treatment"". I hope the pictures of my two cats don't get ME in trouble."
982,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"I would give this a 3.5 star if I could, but I thought a solid 3 was too low.I was in the market for a new phone, and I was looking for one with a NFC reader.But I wasn't about to buy a 800+ Dollar moto edge for them to take away features like the headphone jack and Micro SD card slot.But as far as I could tell, non of their newer phones had an NFC chip without giving up those other features.I was about ready to give up and try searching other brands until they dropped this little gem a few months ago.It costs significantly less than the edge+, and it has all the features I was looking for in a phone without any tradeoffs! (At least on paper)Before I get into my main issue with this phone however, I will say every other aspect of this phone seemed great.Stylus is solid metal as well, nice quality.That said...The camera really was not impressive for me.Honestly speaking, it kinds sucked when put up against my expectations...I currently own a 2017 Moto g7 Power (12MP Single Camera), and before that a Droid Turbo 2 (21MP Single Camera).I used to love my Turbo 2, the camera was awesome!I was sad to give it up due to the failing battery, but the g7 while noticeable drop in camera quality, had an awesome battery!(Honestly, battery matters more to me than camera anyways.)When I found the Stylus 5G and noticed it had the same battery size as my current phone, plus all these features, I was super excited.But once I got the phone, the picture quality on the claimed 50MP camera was no better than the 12MP on my current one....I have 2 simple tests for this, take pictures of clouds, and take pictures of my pants.This tests both long distance and short distance image quality, and I judge it by how many details I can spot in the clouds, and how clear/easy it is to see the cloth pattern on my pants.Verdict: Barely any noticeable difference...Normally I wouldn't be this critical of a phone, but for me to be able to notice a significant difference between 12MP Cam and a good 21MP Cam, but for a 12MP and a 50MP to be almost equal?.....Sorry, but the claims don't match the results in my eyes.(Also tried multiple settings like Ultra Resolution and Pro mode, and even post editing. Didn't Help)I do have a theory for why this might be happening though.This phone has a quad Pixel Feature.Quick Photography lesson:Photo sensors with larger Pixels sensors can absorb more light, allowing for better Night shots.That's why a lot of newer cameras couldn't take good night shots while a lot of older cameras did better.As the tech got smaller and more detailed, it gave up being able to absorb more light for night shots.That said:Quad Pixel Mode is a feature where the small pixels on a camera combine in groups of 4 to mix data and behave as if they're one bigger pixel. (ergo: Quad Pixel)This allows for better shots in low light conditions.Long story short, I think the camera might be stuck in Quad Pixel Mode.50MP / 4 = 12.5MPWhen you look at that math, it makes sense why the phones camera's have hardly any difference in quality.Problem is, I returned it for a replacement phone, and ran into the same issue...(That's two phones that had bad cameras)I really want to love this phone, but I got my hopes to high for a ALL the features.And I didn't really want to compromise when paying this much for a phone.So I returned the replacement.Hopefully this is just something software side that will be fixed later for other buyers.I did find another moto phone from last year that looks like it might fit my needs better.Even if the camera (108MP) is a quarter as good as it claims it will be better than this phone.And to top it off it's 200$ cheaper and has a bigger battery."
983,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,I replaced my old moto-g fast 3G with only 32GB of internal memory. This phone is a smooth transition from the G-fast as the UI is pretty much the same but better & faster bcuz of 5G 8Gb Ram & 256 GB of internal memory & a free 256GB SD card. Plus with the Google backup about 95% of transferring your data & settings we're already done. This phone is about the same price as the one they sell in the MetroPCS stores but the one they sell only has 6 GB Ram & 128GB of internal memory plus they weren't in stock at the 3 local stores. I think Samsung & apple are overpriced & this phone is more than capable of doing what I need. Also sound quality from speaker & headphones are way better than my old phone & has NFC as well. I've been real happy with the Motorola phones lately! Also people complain about bloatware & extra apps but all phones come with that & can be uninstalled or disabled. I don't know about this phone since I already had the apps but people used to say that Motorola doesn't have a gallery for photos or an app for file management but (files & gallery) by Google take care of that.
984,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,This phone is VERY fast and the battery last a long time.  I have upgrade this phone from my Moto E6 that I purchase in 2019 and now it is very slow and no more security updates at all and it is only Android 9.  The Moto E6 is a basic phone and it was a temp phone for me anyway.  When I bring it to the office and I work 8 hrs a day and I didn't have to recharge the battery which is wonderful until the 2nd day. The battery last a whole day but the next day you will have to charge it.  The next day the battery still has 25% left.  I would wait until the 15% left and then charge it.  Android 12 has a overcharge protection which is good.  My Moto E6 did not have that option because in Android 9 it was not written then.  I have very happy about my purchase.
985,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"First off this review is of the 2022 5G stylus Moto g. Not the 2021, and not the non-5g version. Both of those phones use a completely different chip set, different screen refresh rates etc. I got this phone at $349 and I thought that was a very fair price. After using the phone for a couple of months I now know that was a bargain! The battery life is excellent, with a TPU case the phone still runs fairly cool unless I plan to game. It runs a very clean version of android, with the few exceptions the classic Motorola add-ons. I haven't had a Motorola phone in about 2 years, and they added a new thing which is a gaming center. Very cool! All the settings you need right at your fingertips. I am very pleased with this phone, anyone who cannot afford a cutting edge top of the line phone should be looking at this phone. It has a fast processor, and long battery life. A 120 hertz refresh rate on the screen which has excellent Sharp graphics. A great deal!"
986,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"I had the 2020 Edge. I hated many things about that phone but mostly the gimmicky curved edges. Well it slipped out of my hand & 1 of those impossible to protect edges hit a rock and the screen cracked. No more curved phones for me. This phone has a flat screen as its' first plus. It has the storage and recent OS. I thought I'd like the stylus however each use results in utter frustration as I want to use it to more accurately hit the tiny keyboard keys but when I pull out the stylus, the keyboard vanishes. It can be retrieved, but not quickly so I'm opting to use a stylus not connected to the phone and just leave the one in the phone there permanently. I was able to find a decent case with a raised lip all around the flat screen to protect it. The screen protector was easy enough to apply. The phone is plenty loud enough on calls. It's not good at connecting seamlessly with Bluetooth devices if you regularly use more than one such as a shower speaker, a car radio, and a tv sound bar. This is most noticeable in the car where manually connecting it is next to impossible without stopping to park to connect the phone to have music while driving. It takes decent pictures. At this point I've had it about 6 weeks. I'd recommend to anyone wanting a large hard drive, decent sound, & a flat screen. It's also fairly free of worthless bloat ware.2022OCT20 Update: One major irritation I've discovered is that while driving with polarized sunglasses on this phone's screen can not be viewed while the phone is in landscape mode. Since this was how I used the phone for navigation while driving I had to buy a new mount to keep the phone vertical while driving to prevent getting utterly lost in new areas. The polarized screen is touted as a security measure but for me it is just a major annoyance."
987,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"Bought this phone to put a custom ROM on it, and despite being sold as unlocked that refers to only the network, so far haven't been able to unlock the bootloader so I can get something on it.  The main issue if the option in Dev Options for OEM Unlocking is grayed out, and from what I have read so far there MIGHT be a week long timer on it that the phone has to be connected to wifi or cellular network for at least a week before I MIGHT be able to toggle the option.  Nice phone otherwise I guess, came with an unholy amount of Google and Motorola bloatware (which is why I want to put my own ROM on it), but for the everyday user I am sure it's a decent phone at a pretty good price.UPDATE: Gave it another star, after waiting three days making sure the phone had an internet connection it allowed the option and I was able to do what I wanted to do (unlock the bootloader so I could root the phone and put another ROM on it).  All in all, for the price, this is a hard phone to beat, it's as fast as any I've had to date, nice size and the battery is awesome, it's nice to be back into a phone I don't have to charge every day or even every other day.  I haven't really fully switched over from my TCL yet, so I haven't been using it like regular, but pretty happy with it now."
988,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"Though I'm not as familiar with Android devices as I am with Apple, I also know Audio/Video,  Electronics, Pro Audio & Instruments, so I know a solid phone when I hold one, unfortunately I had to return mine, I couldn't get it to charge, so I just went back to my trusted... but I was very impressed with the build and the weight it had to it was nice!  I'm not into the large phone myself, I can't deal with it.... it's like holding my iPad up to the side of my head!  But overall the 120Hz Refresh on the display was incredibly beautiful and I would highly recommend the Moto G Stylus 5G 2022, I know it's tough buying an iPhone, but the one that I'm going to make a spare is an iPhone 8... that's the last time that I bought a new iPhone.... the Moto G Stylus is a very tough contender and it is an incredibly solid and perfectly weighted and it's half the price of the iPhone!"
989,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"After 3-weeks no one could hear me when I answered phone. Had to deal with manufacturer because by the time I asked for a replacement, it had been more than 30-days purchase. It was ridiculous because I was trying to give Motorola all my information, but they COULDN'T hear me. Duh! Did get replacement directly from Motorola but it's only been a week..."
990,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"This phone does everything well. The voice to text is very good as is the scrolling. Quick and accurate. Battery life excellent. Shape, size is very good. The apps come up quickly. Reception is better than the Galaxy A53 I owned for a month which was glitchey. Slow and just not a good phone. Since I am not using my phone for movies, super high resolution doesn't matter to me. It is very good. A strong, quick acting phone. I highly recommend this phone!!"
991,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"This isn't my first Moto, nor my first stylus phone. Some folks don't care for the stylus, but I absolutely love them. And I love this phone. The features are awesome, plus there isn't anything on it that can't be deleted off if I don't want it. I'm so happy with it!"
992,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"Moto G Stylus 5G (2022 edition) comments.Pros:2-day battery life minimum.Luxuriously fast operation. Even faster internet surfing. In a good spot the 5G internet is faster than my home internet.Low-hassle upgrade from older Android phone. Google did a good job with the software. For service, only had to move the SIM card over, phone did the rest.Stylus is too skinny but it works fine.Real headphone jack.Second, wide-angle camera is very nice to have.Moto gestures for flashlight, camera, etc. are the same as before and are useful.Cons:The camera is OK but not great. For this much money it should be much better. Seems to be struggling with focus when taking video. The camera app has improved somewhat, though.Internal speaker does not sound as good as earlier Moto models. It's OK for voice but music or ringtones don't sound as good. There's some Dolby Atmos AI thing that won't turn off; it's probably trying to enhance clarity or something. Seems useless to me.The Moto lock screen interferes with the Android lock screen; you should turn off one or the other. They should have fixed that years ago. It's a bad experience that the phone reacts two different ways depending on the exact circumstances when you reach for it.Too many interruptions while I am using the phone. The Moto apps always want to pop up and introduce themselves. There are a lot of little notifications in different places, some helpful, many just annoying - a lot like most Windows 10 and 11 computers.Not enough volume levels. I need to be able to turn notification sounds down but I can't lower the volume to the correct level. This is an Android problem, but Moto should provide better volume controls."
993,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"The phone is excellent but the ad is misleading.  As others have pointed out internal storage is 256gb, not 512 as listed (SD providing the additional 256Gb).  I upgraded from the Moto G7 to this phone and am really happy.  This is a solid phone and the improvement in performance is quite noticeable over the Moto G7."
994,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"Could not get it to connect to network. Took it to AT&T store and was told it was not compatible with AT&T network.After calling customer service and speaking with a very helpful lady named Andrea, we went through Amazon tech support and discovered the phone was faulty. A replacement was sent the next day and the new one connected to AT&T just fine."
995,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"The Screen looks nice.  Bright, crisp and clear.  The width is the same as the 2020 G Stylus but it is about a half inch taller.  It makes it tough to access the entire screen.  they probably went overboard with the screen being to tall.It has 8gig memory and 256gb internal storage.  It comes with a 256gb sandisk SD card so you have a total of 512gb or storage.  You can replace the 256gb with up to 1tb.Ports.  It has a headphone jack,  USB C.Stylus:  I did not find I used it much on the 2020 version.  I have not played with it much but seems to be about the same.  They have handwriting to text in this version which seems to be pretty good on my horrible hand writing.  The stylus itself is a pop out vs the old one which was pressure held.On the AT&T network it said it was 5G and speed test showed 130MB down/30MB Up.  Of course as you drove around that varied greatly.  I am not sure what AT&T/phone is claiming as 5g since AT&T 5g was listed as future but it does seem to be fast.  I will compare it to the 2020 version and see if there is a difference.It comes with Android 12 which took a little getting used to.  Im not sure why they always make changes just to make changes.  They seemed to have changed how the pull down from the top looks but except for how it looks it is basically the same."
996,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,Great phone. It does everything I need it to.
997,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,I always wanted a stylus phone. Put the status phones was so pricey that I never thought of buying one. When I saw this on sale on Amazon I grabbed it. The best smartphone I'm using so far. I have used Samsung Google and Apple phones earlier which are good but they are too pricey. I am been using this for more than 3 months now. Moving forward I will stick on to the Motorola brand. I think they are priced very well for what they are.
998,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,Upgraded from a LG Stylo 6 and I like it so much better. Much faster and longer battery life.
999,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"Stylus input on this device is extremely bad.  Its nearly impossible to take notes quickly, which is the whole reason for this phone's existence. Sometimes it does not detect stylus taps (it uses the digitizer grid which seems to have gaps) and movement of anything using the stylus has a jarring, stuttering motion.The cameras are acceptable but everything else is fantastic.  The 2022 5G model has an excellent CPU and battery and it is rootable.IF the stylus worked correctly, this would be my most recommend phone."
1000,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,Fast shipping pro packaging and the phone is amazing!! It really worth for the money !
1001,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"As a phone, it did fine. Fast enough, responsive. As a stylus device, it's very disappointing. I've had 4 devices with an active stylus: gateway convertible laptop, an Asus M80TA, and 2 different Samsung tablets with s-pens. I was expecting to be able to use this phone to take notes too, but it doesn't work the same. Unlike the others, it can't tell the difference between the stylus and a fingertip or palm, which makes writing very difficult. If you're wanting to take notes, look elsewhere."
1002,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"CAUTION Buyers - The phone is awesome and functioning as expected. The issue I have is the listing is misleading as it implies you are purchasing a phone with 512gb of internal storage with a free 256gb SD card. The phone is only a 256gb internal storage model.Now granted, I operated a 64+64gb phone for 3 years and never came close to filling it with pictures, movies, or sweet cat memesâ€¦ but the selling point here was a universe of storage the starship enterprise couldnâ€™t cover. I just wanted to let potential buyers know this description makes you feel like Jamie Dutton when he finds his amazing father, only to find out heâ€™s half the man that was advertised.Hope this helps set expectations."
1003,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"I had a Moto G Power 2020, no Verizon network issues. This phone, the Moto G Stylus 2022 required a software upgrade to get any service. Even after that, the service is spotty. It's capable of 5G (other phone was 4G), so it seems like Motorola doesn't have adequate software to handle it. It's frustrating because I can't always use maps while driving and even phone calls do not always work."

1006,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"Five stars for the phone, but downgraded to two stars due to the process of finding out it won't work with some carriers -- NOT the fault of Amazon.  Thankfully Amazon's return policy is quick and easy.Very good phone, and a great phone for the price if you buy it on sale.  Large screen, handy stylus for quickly jotting down notes, fast performance -- what's not to like?  The only issue with this unlocked version is that Spectrum Mobile, Visible, and probably some other carriers won't let you use this version on their system.  The description ""Unlocked for All Carriers"" is true, but unfortunately that doesn't mean it will work for all carriers.Entering my phone's IMEI number on both the Spectrum Mobile and Visible websites revealed that this model has an invalid IMEI number or is not compatible with their systems.  Motorola says it will work on those systems, and the carriers sell a version of this phone that will work, but this unlocked version is not allowed on either carriers' system due to blocking the IMEI numbers of units not sold by these carriers.It's a shame that I have to return this, all because some carriers want to force you to buy their version of this phone for about the same price, but with lower specs (4 GB RAM instead of 8 GB, and 128 GB internal memory instead of 256 GB).  Lazy or deceptive systems of maintaining valid IMEI numbers by some carriers needs to end!If you want to buy this great phone, be sure it will work on your carrier's system.  Unfortunately just knowing that it will work from a specs standpoint can be negated by the way the IMEI number database is handled.  You can't use a phone unless a carrier recognizes the phone's IMEI number as valid, but you can't determine a phone's IMEI number without buying it."

So you feel like you're holding something.Battery is good.  Storage is good.  Sound is very good.I came over from the note series.  Best thing about this move is I'm away from Bixby.

1020,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"As a Motorola user, I wanted to update my Moto G stylus with the new Moto G stylus 5G (2022).  I have owned 2 more moto g phones before and they all work just fine.When I installed the T-mobile sim card, I could receive calls, text messages and had a fabulous 5G internet connection.  But after a couple of minutes I couldn't receive phone calls or text messages.  The phone calls were redirect to voice mail, and the messages just didn't arrived.Since I really like moto phones, I tried every thing to fix it, I went to T-mobile to reset it, it worked, and then a couple of minutes later the same thing.  I changed the sim card to a new one, and the same thing happened, no phone calls or messages.  I tried all that manuals and Moli assistant told me.  Reboot the phone, reset the network, clear cache, clear data, update software, even a factory reset;  they all worked for a couple of minutes and then the same thing.I thought that the phone was defective so I ordered a replacement through Amazon, and the new phone arrived one day after.  The very same thing happened.  I tried all the solutions, but could only receive phone calls for a couple of minutes and then nothing.I just talked to Motorola support, with a very friendly agent, and he told me that the phone need to be sent to them to repair it, and that they will send me a repaired phone after  4 or 5 days after they received my phone.  I don't think I have to go through all of these with a new phone.I decided to return it to Amazon, and buy another phone from a different brand."

Motorola seems to indicate it might be compatible with  Verizon 5G later through a software update, but there is no timing associated with its release.  Motorola seems confused on why they are advertising it as 5G Verizon compatible if the patch is not yet released, but can't answer whether or not they have released it yet (still waiting for their response on that issue).  Verizon seems to have less information than Motorola about why they can't get it to connect to their 5G network, and suggests I talk to Motorola.  Hoping this is resolved soon, and that I did not buy (2) $350 phones that do not work as advertised.  Seems like a nice 4G phone, but was trying to buy a 5G one like it was marketed.

1029,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"This cell phone is a source of frustration- total waste of money. It replaced a Samsung A20, $140- it has more user features that users will use then this phone. This phone has 5G- that were its best feature begins and ends. However, since I've had this phone, I've called my service provider more in the last 2 months because mobile data stops working that I had in the previous 10 years. Next, the first time I went to reply to a text msg, the keyboard disappears and tries to forces the user to use the stylus. You need two hands and you need to lay the phone in order to use the stylus. If I wanted to do that, I'd use my tablet. If you make a typo w/stylus, it's difficult to impossible to correct.  In order to get the keyboard back, you need to change the settings. It warns that the Microsoft keyboard can monitor and can send everything to Microsoft. SHAME ON MOTO-G for not designing a keyboard to be used with your own phone! Sometimes text message do not have a date on them either. The camera is horrible. Take a pic more then 10 feet away, it is grainy- looks like 2 Mega pixel camera from 1995. This no where near a 50MP camera. The moto-g motions do not work for me. This phone is not worth $350, more like $100 maybe."
1030,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"This phone comes with many, many, features already installed. It's very easy to set-up and use. The camera is phenomenal, the sound is outstanding, and the memory is very high level. I'm enjoying this phone."
1031,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"As much as I love the pure experience that you get from a Pixel device, the Pixel 6 Pro found itself in my sock drawer due to the really awful 5G reception I was getting on Verizon. Where my S22 Ultra would get 300 megabits down (sometimes more) in a C-Band area, the Pixel could barely squeeze out 100 megabits, with similar choking on the upstream.Well... I'm pleased to say that the updated modem in the Pixel 7 Pro is leaps and bounds better. So much so, that I don't notice any reception differences between it and my S22 Ultra.As for the rest of the phone, well, if you're coming from a Pixel 6 series, the differences are going to be much more incremental unless macro photography is your must-have (and to that end, it works beautifully, and is one area where the S22 Ultra and prior Pixels simply don't compare).Build is very, very similar to the 6 Pro. If you hold them side by side, the biggest difference you'll probably notice in the physical details is that the right buttons are shifted up a couple of millimeters. Juuuuust enough that you won't be able to use your 6 Pro case, unless it has a cutout on the side for buttons. The camera visor seems a little more pronounced to me, and the selfie dot seems to blend a bit better, but that could just be the improved display on the 7 Pro. The overall feel is fairly premium, though I think the display has a kind of plastic feel to it. The S22 series feels much more solid and utilitarian, but I'd argue less expensive.Surprisingly, you can notice the improvement in processor speed in several apps, not to mention just scrolling through settings. Again, using my S22 Ultra as a comparison, I can't say I've noticed a performance hit, even though the single core specs on the Snapdragon processor are better. Overall, I think it would be fair to say that the Pixel 7 Pro does all of the things the Pixel 6 Pro does, but faster and sometimes (like with Magic Eraser) better.At launch, there have been a lot of incentives on the Pixel 7 series that make upgrading less expensive -- potentially free, and if that's what you're weighing a purchase against, I'd say ""go for it"". But if you're looking at a difference of hundreds of dollars to go from a 6 to a 7, I'm not sure I'd recommend that unless you were experiencing the same modem issues that so many other owners had."
1032,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"I went from a Pixel 3 XL to the Pixel 7 Pro.  Here is my review of the Pro:1. Adaptive brightness is very slow2. Phone sometimes lags3. Maybe a bit faster with some things but basically the same as my Pixel 3 XL4. Phone sometimes freezes and I have to restart, which had finally been fixed in Android 125. Updates take hours but you can be on the phone during them, a win in my view6. Battery life is better7. What they don't tell you beforehand, is that the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro only support 64-bit apps; so you might find yourself missing some apps and games and icon packs, etc.8. Transfer of apps and stuff went very well9. In some apps, texting has a weird lag; you have to wait for the letters you type to show up, it's very aggravating10. The screenshot option works better; not the buttons, that option still sucks11. It charges okay: I went from 19% to 61% in 30 minutes; 85% in one hour12. The regular camera quality hasn't changed, although Night Sight seems to work poorly, adding a yellow tinge and even splotches of yellow - so Night Sight is much worse than my Pixel 3, see the photos to compare (comparison is between 2 photos taken with the Pixel 7 Pro, one with Night Sight and one without)13. The zoom camera function is why I opted for the Pro, and it is a lovely thing to have - see the photos of a shot with the normal range, then a shot of the same scene at the maximum 5x range14. There's an automatic macro setting which is nice, too.  Just bring the camera close to the object and it automatically adjusts to the macro setting15. The size is almost identical to my Pixel 3 XL, just a tiny bit taller and a tiny bit heavierIn all, I like the phone very much.  But if not for the zoom, I'd have been happy with the Pixel 7, I think.  In fact, I was still happy with my Pixel 3 XL.  If it wasn't for Google stopping the security updates, I wouldn't have upgraded; a big plus for the 7 Pro is Google's promise to support security updates for 5 years.  There is very little difference between the two phones, apart from the zoom/macro and how bad Night Sight is on the new camera."
1033,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"As a professional photographer who shot with Hasselblad & Nikon for 30+ years around the world, Iâ€™m VERY critical of photo quality from whatever phone I carry daily. Past 2 years, Iâ€™ve been satisfied with Pixel 4A 5G which received rave reviews and prompted P 7 Pro purchase. Prior to it, I had many Sony, Samsung, TCL and more.Pixel 7 Pro got my attention after several unveiling reviews. Thus, I decided to do a detailed comparison for anyone considering the same upgrade. Here are my findings (P4A vs. P7P):RELEASE DATE: Sept 30, 2020 vs Oct. 6, 2022SCREEN: Gorilla Glass 3 vs Gorilla Glass Victus & IP68 water resistant up to 1.5m for 30 minutesSCREEN SIZE: 6.2 inches vs 6.7 inchesSCREEN BRIGHTNESS: Estimated 400nits vs 1500 nits peakSCREEN RESOLUTION: 1080x2340 pixels (~413ppi) vs 1440x3120 pixels (~512ppi)OS: Android 11 vs Android 13  NOTE:  Google did update to Android 13 for Pixel 4A 5GCAMERAS: 12.2MP & 16MP vs 12MP, 48MP & 50MP What these numbers really mean when shooting: Based on my decades with many film and digital cameras, the images I captured on my Pixel 4 seemed to range from about 35mm to 120mm. The Pixel 7 Pro seems to be about 28mm to 240mm which is what I normally shot with my Nikons and Hasselblads.  The P7P also has dual LED flash vs 1 on P4A.AUTOFOCUS SPEED: P7P won this race by slightly noticeable difference.VIDEO STABILIZATION: Sorry but my video days stopped after producing music videos in the 80â€™s so I did not compare this.AUDIO: Stereo speakers on both but only P4A has 3.5mm jackWIFI: P7P adds 6eBLUETOOTH: 5.0 vs 5.2BATTERY: 3885mAh vs 5000mAh, wireless & reverse chargingDAILY USE: Both phones are fast but the P7P is a teeny weeny bit faster. If this was the only difference, I would not upgrade from the P4A. The 5G speeds are virtually identical when tested with MINT Mobile. Note: MINT uses T-Mobile towers and I have one Â½ mile from home. After 2 years with fingerprint sensor on the back, I find P7P fingerprint under screen to be less user friendly (easier to use index finger on back).BOTTOM LINE: Many years with many Lithium Ion batteries taught me that bad batteries happen. Fortunately for me, none have caught on fire or exploded. However, I have run into a number that would not charge or provide energy as advertised. Unfortunately, The P7P I received arrived with 63% charge and despite connecting it to a powerful 65W first class 5V charger, 29 minutes later it was still at 63% so I returned the phone. Since then, I have also seen reports of hardware and software bugs by other recipients (SEE TUBE VIDEOS). Another life lesson is that first adopters of anything (especially new cars) often encounter problems. Thus, I will wait a few months and possibly try Pixel 7 Pro again. If you buy one, I hope you receive one that works perfectly.NEXT:  I expect to see many new phones at CES 2023 in January. I will update this review when I have further details on ANYTHING similar (or possibly better) than this slippery one."
1034,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"I love this phone so far. The camera is great, it is speedy and everything is very responsive. My only 2 complaints: 1) It has some weird issues with scrolling, it is sometimes VERY sensitive and it makes it difficult to navigate a page or site. 2) Battery life is not horrible, but it should be better. Hopefully software updates can improve these gripes in the future."

It still works great other than the battery life after countless cycles. The Pixel 7 Pro is almost the same overall size, except taller by a little bit, and is notably faster. I wish the screen would get a little wider instead of a bit taller. A case is a must as the phone is very slick. Changing the SIM over and copying everything to the new phone was a breeze. I use Visible Wireless which is perfect at only $45 per month. Five stars so far!"
1037,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"Moving from the Pixel 4XL after having had the Pixel 2XL. Using this phone with a case is a pain in the ass. The curved screen leads the case manufacturers to reduce the protection along the long edge. Screen protectors cause trouble for the fingerprint sensor. Most of them have annoying visible circles over the fingerprint sensor due to material changes that are supposed to enable the sensor to continue working.Of the two screen protectors have used so far, the first (a case built-in) was not well fitted with a slight bulge at the curve. My second has adhesive that is migrated to cover part of the fingerprint sensor, stopping it from reading, locking me out of some apps configured to use biometric security.The inability to use face unlock for secure biometrics is sorely missed from the 4XL.I would would far prefer the unobscurable fingerprint sensor on the back of the 2XL.I'm still not sure about the larger screen being any benefit at all.Cameras are collectively impressive with Google's camera software thumbs up there."
1038,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"Update 11/27 So the fingerprint scanner on this thing worked pretty good while the weather was still kind of warm and then as soon as my hand started to dry out from the cold weather, it's basically worthless. I have to retrain the fingerprint several times a week and even then it works about half the time. I don't understand why they did away with the physical fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone. That was a bad move. The on-screen fingerprint scanners suck for anybody that actually uses their hands or has dry skin or has damp skin? Or I could keep going on but this is just a fail. The good news is it's quick so it rejects me quickly and then I have to type in my pin I'm really thinking about downgrading to my old pixel 5. Also the speech to text. The one on my pixel 5. It made little mistakes. It would correct things here and there. This one makes giant leaps in the wrong direction, constantly adding question marks And other punctuation where it shouldn't. Or completely changing what I said. Not just a word but an entire sentence. Honestly, it seems like these phones are getting worse instead of better. The camera's great sure, but other than that this was a downgrade. I regret buying it.Unfortunately I use Google Fi as my phone service which really limits my options for phones. So it looks like I'm going to have to change phone carriers and phones.Original review.  I bought a pixel 6 and gave it to my son because the fingerprint scanner was terrible. I'm glad to see they at least corrected that issue. It works most of the time unless my hand is damp or right after I have showered. otherwise it responds quickly. Also, the speech to text works differently.  Prior to this I was using a pixel 5.the pixel 7 tries to predict whether I'm asking question or exclaiming or whatever and throws in random punctuation. It also takes a lot longer to process speech to text. I'd like to think it's trying to make me sound like less of an idiot, but in the end it makes me sound like more of an idiot because it's throwing in random punctuation.  The camera is amazing. I'm gobsmacked by how far it can zoom compared to the pixel 5 but the trade off is you have the big lense block protruding from your phone.  My biggest complaint is they didn't include a charger. They threw in a USB cable but no charger. That's low rent and that's the reason I'm giving it four stars. Seriously google? Pinch them pennies.  The phone is working great. I will up date this review as I have more experience with the phone. So far. I'm about a week in and I'm loving it. But seriously Google you couldn't throw in a charger for $900?  For that price you would think that you would be able to give us the charger that probably costs you $3.  Not just a USB cable that I can plug into my computer."

1051,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"I am an iPhone user (currently using an iPhone 12 Pro) for 12+ years so I really had no idea what to expect. After ten days of use, I do find some pros and cons to share.1. Data transfer from iPhoneFirstly I tried with my husbandâ€™s iPhone 8 Plus (as on the picture). Most apps were synchronized with no issues. He had approximately 30G of data and it took about 25 minutes to finish the synchronization and setup process. But when he discovered that it wouldnâ€™t synchronize the data on one app he uses on a daily basis, he got really upset and decided to switch back to iPhone. So then I took it over and started to test myself.2. Touch screenI do feel like the touch screen is not as responsive as iPhone, especially when you swipe.3. CameraBest feature on Pixel 7 Pro. I just use default setting and all my pictures are almost perfect. Definitely love the camera.4. App compatibilityNot all apps are as good as they are on IOS. Some got missing features, some are slow or have bugs. I donâ€™t blame Google on that, developers need to pay more attentions on the Android version.5. PricePrice is definitely a big plus. It is $200 - $300 lower than a comparable iPhone. Also Amazon has a nice deal of getting $200 gc on this. Really good value for money.Still Iâ€™m getting used to it, there are definitely a lot of great features I havenâ€™t tried. If you are a frequent G Suite user, this is definitely a great phone to have. Worth trying!"
1052,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"I'm coming over from a 4 year old Galaxy Note 9 (the last true great Android phone) and I honestly gotta say that the Pixel 7 pro is a disappointment. My review is based off things I look for in a smartphone which are camera quality, display, battery life, software experience, and general usability.Straight away I realized the display on the Pixel is noticeably duller and even loses details on some bright areas. The higher refresh rate is nice but I can only imagine how much better the S22 ultra screen is than the Pixel (This holiday season they're about the same price anyways) .Battery life is also very disappointing. My 4 year old Note 9 has had pretty bad battery life recently, which is why I wanted to upgrade. But to my disappointment the Pixel is BARELY better, which is absolutely absurd. Honestly this is a real deal breaker and everyone who wants to get this phone should know this.Software experience is also weirdly buggy, but not in an infuriating way. It's smooth and fast but options for various things will fail to load or occasionally crash. Reloading the app will fix the issue but I would've expected a software company like Google to be on top of this. People have had these issues for every pixel device since the first.Camera is really good, best on any current phone for sure. Can't complain about that.Modem is decent, not noticeablely better than my Samsung but not worse either.Speakers are not better than the Note 9, nor does it have an SD card slot or headphone jack. But I guess no one does that anyways besides Sony, which also has their fair share of issues.All in all, it's not a bad phone but it is disappointing. At this point I'd love to give a better recommendation but unfortunately there is no great Android phone on sale right now. So, if you're in the market for an android phone my advice is to wait for next year."
1053,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"Overall a well designed phone, has a high quality camera, high resolution screen . the downfall is the battery drains quickly under normal use of video streaming , the edge panels do not flow all the way to out edge of the panel making it look a little cheap . A good phone with need of some screen improvement and battery performance ."
1054,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"I currently use a Google Pixel 6 Pro. After hearing that the Google Pixel 7 Pro was available, I was eager to try it out.My first impression is that looks very similar to the Google Pixel 6 Pro. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference except for the position of the power and volume buttons. I tried to take advantage of this by putting the phone in my Google Pixel 6 Pro's case, but this did not work since the side buttons are lower. This felt like an arbitrary change on an otherwise identical looking phone.When I booted up the phone, I was delighted at the feel of the haptic feedback. The loading screen showed an abstract geometric shape bouncing into another. The haptic feedback felt like what I was seeing on the screen was happening in the phone. The haptics was similar to the Nintendo Switch HD Rumble except a bit stronger. I don't know of anything else other than the loading screen where that is being used.Transferring from my old phone was easy. I connected the included USB C to USB C cord to both phones and followed the prompts. In less than an hour I had all of my data transferred including my phone number.One of the first things I tried was setting up the face unlock feature. I followed the prompt and was able to detect my face. When I look at the phone, it recognizes me quickly and I can swipe up to dismiss the lock screen. I also set up my fingerprint. The Pixel 7 Pro is more responsive to my fingerprint than the Pixel 6 Pro.One of the things I enjoy the most about Pixel phones is the camera. I love that the Pixel 7 Pro not only has a 30x zoom, but also a 0.5x zoom. The 0.5x zoom is allows me to get a wide shot of my surroundings. And the zoomed in photos allow me to get close from far away. There are some challenges I've had with zoomed in photography in the past that this phone compensates for. When I'm zoomed in, the camera typically magnifies my shakiness making it hard to get a still shot. The camera on the 7 Pro somehow compensates for that making for a stable shot. Another issue I have when photographing something zoomed in is finding the subject I'm trying to take a picture of. I love how there is a view finder in the top left corner that guides me to where I want to photograph. In the photos I included in this review, I took the picture of the chicken coop, tree house, and shed at 0.5x zoom and then took a picture of the window of the chicken coop and the pirate flag at 30x zoom.The camera also includes a macro mode. This will allow me to zoom in close to small objects. I found this challenging to use. I had to step back to get a clear picture. It is leaps ahead of what I could do on a Pixel 6 Pro however.One other feature I love about the Pixel 7 Pro is the ""Night Sight"". I took some pictures of the night sky with this mode and got some really great shots even in dark conditions.I think the Pixel 7 Pro is a nice phone and the best Pixel available. However, outside of the camera, it felt very similar to the Google 6 Pro."
1055,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"Before I start this review, I Just want to say that the PIXEL 3 XL is hands down the best phone google has created, period!I've used to daily drive the Pixel 3 XL every day since it came out, never had a problem with it, never upgraded it because the Pixel 4 was just a gimmick, and the Pixel 5 was just an absolute joke until I took the 3 XL scuba diving (120 feet submerged) in July of 2021 and the phone was basically no longer able to take in charge, so I was forced to use a wireless charger for the next few months until Google released the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, which was an absolute pain, but the 3 XL still performed flawlessly until Google released Its last ever software/security update (android 11 to 12) in October 2021 and then out of nowhere it was extremely noticeable that Google nerfed the Pixel 3XL's Performance by a long shot.November 2021I ordered a Pixel 6 and didn't go for the 6 Pro because on Paper the Pixel 6 was more than enough for my needs and it wasn't worth spending another $300 for the 6 Pro. As the Pixel 6 had a larger display, double the Ram, double the performance, and a better rear camera set up compared to the Pixel 3XL. So you would think it would be a really nice experience right? Unfortunately not, the Pixel 6 had so many software issues and bugs it wasn't even funny. There were multiple times where I would send an SMS message and it wouldn't send, constant connectivity issues, for example it would keep switching from my WIFI network to my limited data plan, like 50 times a day, extremely frustrating when you're on a limited data plan. The fingerprint sensor was really bad, really slow and most times inaccurate, especially if you got working hands, man I missed the back finger print sensor on the 3 XL. And the Camera set up, while Pixel 6 rear camera set is absolutely stunning, the front facing camera is just joke, such a huge downgrade from the Pixel 3XL's Dual front facing camera set up, as someone who travels and takes selfies constantly, this was a huge let down, the selfies are low quality and grainy, and its automatically set up as a wide angle viewing angle, which is not what I want 60% of the time.After solid 10 months of owning the phone, with Security and system updates, the phone finally started to function and perform normally, good battery life, an exceptional experience, something I should've experienced when I first bought the device. Other than that, I liked the design of the overall phone, love the camera visor, camera system that served me well in Ireland, UK, Sweden, and Iceland.October 2022PIXEL 7 PROMy younger sister's phone was busted, so as a nice brother, I decided to gave her my pixel 6 just to help her out through college, which I hope it will her serve her well within the next 4 years of guaranteed security updates.I ended up ordering the Pro version this time mostly because the regular google Pixel 7 came with a noticeable smaller screen than the Pixel 6, and with the Google discounts that I got it was worth it, lemme break it down.I first pre-ordered the Pixel 7 Pro 256gb model, with the promotional $200 google store gift card. But I ended up returning the phone recently to exchange it for the 512gb Version, but google still allowed me to keep my $200 promotional store credit.Plus the black Friday deal, which was already discounted $159 offAnd I decided to trade in my old broken Pixel 3XL because currently (till the 28th of NOVEMBER) google store has a SPECIAL TRADE IN promotion where they basically offer 3 times more the amount for your old phone with the purchase of one of the new Pixel 7, which is insane because Best Buy quoted me $35 for my Pixel 3XL when google quoted me $264, which they already credited me with.So in total I spent $522 with tax for the Pixel 7 Pro 512 GB MODELEssentially with the Pixel 7 Pro, the one I'm currently using, I love it. Its not perfect but google fixed majority of the many bugs and problems that I had with the Pixel 6. The Finger Print does work better and its about 35% faster, which honestly suits me just fine, Phone performs flawlessly, but still has some bugs, like when you get a text notification, there's a white bar above it when the screen is black, but with updates google will fix it. The rear camera setup is virtually the same from the pixel 6 except you get the new 5X telephoto camera, where it actually comes in handy sometimes, but the 30X superzoom is just a Gimmick, even with good lighting and stabilization, its just too grainy. The screen on the 7 Pro is really nice and bright, so got no complaints there. The only reason I'm docking a star is because of the front selfie camera, its just as bad as the one from the 6, if not worse, still low quality, grainy, and overall takes pictures that look like you took it from 2016.I'm Happy with the Pixel 7 Pro, with 5 years security updates, unlimited google 1 VPN, and smooth performance, I'm planning to keep it till it dies. Is it worth $900 for the 128gb version, no not really if you're rocking a Pixel 6, 6 Pro (bc google patched up the bugs with updates). But if you have anything older than a Pixel 6, with the current Trade in Promotions, and $150 discount already applied, you'll most definitely be getting the 7 Pro under $550 (depending on what device you're trading it) yes It's absolutely worth it.But I miss the quirky features that google used to input onto their devices or really cool benefits, for example, with the google Pixel 3, you could squeeze your phone to activate google assistant, I used it all the time while driving. Or how google Basically offered free unlimited 3 year google photo storage (at original quality), and the colored power button, those details really go a long way, and that's why I still say the Google Pixel 3XL was the best phone google designed.Regardless Google Pixel 7 Pro is a good phone. Here are the current trade in promotions on google storePIXEL 5 - $400 Trade inPixel 4, 4XL -  $300, $325Pixel 3, 3XL - $250, $275Pixel 2, 2XL - $101, $100"
1056,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"Moved from iphone13pro to pix6a (testing how I'll like it before I spend more), then to pix7 pro.What a great improvement from 6a, I mean responsiveness, picture quality, hardware specs, just wow. Fingerprint is improved and they added in Pix7 face unlock.Now best part is Google's photo and ability to search pictures... Geez, i search for ""cars"" and get every picture I took that has cars. You can do it with anything (date, objects, places) and then edit with suggested tools.Their AI is far from anyone else.Also, capturing audio (voice recorder) is priceless for students.Password manager could be better but works well.For anyone who is concerned about your apple  watches or tablets (ecosystem): Garmin has waaayyy better watches than Apple that work on any platform. Even Iwatch ""ultra"" isn't as close to Phoenix 7 sapphire (has 18days battery life). Drop iphones and free yourselves from wasting money.Glad I'm out of iphone ecosystem"
1057,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"This phone is the best smartphone I have ever used! I love how quick and responsive opening and switching apps is. Scrolling through content is buttery smooth and so so fast! The whole experience is satisfying.I also really love the camera and its features. The 5X optical zoom and up to 30X digital zoom work well and produce some good quality images at those higher zoom levels. Nighttime photos turn out really well thanks to some clever processing.Battery life so far has been excellent. I used to have to charge my old Samsung several times throughout the day but with the Pixel 7 Pro I find myself usually only charging on the drive in to work and the drive home and that's been enough to keep the battery topped off.My only complaint about the Pixel 7 Pro so far is the fingerprint scanner. I have scanned, deleted and rescanned several of my fingers multiple times so far and still it takes 3 or 4 tries to get it to register my fingerprint to unlock the phone.  Occasionally it will take my finger on the first try but that is the exception.Overall I give the Pixel 7 Pro 5 stars even with the minor annoyance of the fingerprint scanner. It is an incredible smartphone and a giant upgrade over my old Samsung Galaxy. And it comes it several hundred dollars less than the other flagship smartphones! That's a winner in my book."
1058,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"I upgraded from a Pixel 5 to the new Pixel 7 Pro and it's quite a nice upgrade. Transferring my apps, photos, videos and settings was quick and easy thanks to the included USB-C to USB-C cable. I love the Pixel 5, but the screen size was a downside for me as I prefer a larger screen for reading without my glasses. The Pixel 7 pro is the smoothest, most elegant phone I've ever had my hands on.Display- 1440p resolution is crisp and clear, though you must manually set it to 1440p in your display settings. The 120hz OLED display is bright and vibrant with rich colors and deep blacks. Watching hi res HDR videos is a treat on this device. Scrolling is luxuriously silky smooth and touch responsiveness and sensitivity is top notch. With 1500 nits peak brightness the display is super easy to see clearly outdoors even without maxing the brightness level.Audio: Big upgrade over the Pixel 5. Audio is clear, good soundstage for phone speakers and even has a bit of bass without distorting. Not at all like the shallow tinny sound you get from most phones.Camera: The Pixel 7 Pro really shines here. I had a bit of trouble at first, either due to having an early production sample with software bugs or possibly my own fault by maybe overwriting the camera app with the one from my Pixel 5 when transferring my apps, the camera app would only crash when opening. This was easily fixed by updating the camera app in the Play Store. Pictures are clear, sharp and vibrant, simply the best photos I have ever taken. Picture stabilization and zoom stabilization(for the telephoto zoom lens) are a great quality of life feature for someone without steady hands(by someone I mean me). The telephoto lens allows me to get clear closeup shots from quite some distance. Videos are also very vibrant and smooth. The video stabilization allows you to take steady video even while running. Night mode is particularly impressive as in the darkness it appears that you have a an actual light source. Great work by Google!Performance: With the new Tensor G2 processor and 12GB of RAM this phone will handle anything you wanna throw at it. The phone is always quick and responsive and apps open instantly.Battery Life: Seems about the same as my Pixel 5. I can get a full 24hrs out of it with moderate use. I would prefer more, but with a bright screen and fast(more power consuming) hardware it's a compromise I can live with.Build quality: The phone has very nice buttons that are firm and clicky and the phone is easy to grip on the sides. The camera bar is aluminum and the body of the phone is surrounded in heavy duty Corning Gorilla Glass Victus, which looks very premium and should withstand a lot of abuse, but is a fingerprint and smudge magnet and makes the phone a bit slippery causing it to often slide out of my pocket when sitting. I will definitely be getting a case for this phone.Biometric Unlock: The Face ID is quick and convenient. The in-screen fingerprint sensor is a downgrade from the dedicated rear sensor on the Pixel 5 in my opinion though. A quick tap almost always unlocked my Pixel 5, but the Pixel 7's sensor is finnicky and often doesn't recognize my fingerprint. It seems to give up after 2 tries and forces my to unlock by PIN.Software notes: Photo unblur is a great feature. You can unblur any pictures in the Google Photos app no matter how old or what camera took the pics, but the results can vary. At some point we are supposed to get free Google VPN, though the feature is not yet available at the time of this review. Not sure how much I trust an information giant like Google with a VPN, but it's still a great value add.Overall, despite some imperfections, this is an outstanding, top notch device, especially if you take a lot of photos or videos."
1059,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"Just for reference my previous phone is the HTC U11 from 2017 (which is still a decent phone today, albeit dated in a couple ways), so I'm not someone who buys a new model phone every year and can see all the little incremental updates they make. For me this phone is a noticeable improvement in every way from that one.Build quality is excellent. The OLED display looks fantastic. Operation is much snappier and you really notice the 120Hz refresh rate when navigating. Battery life seems to be holding up well enough. It has the latest version of Android (of course) and doesn't have any bloatware that I can see which is a huge plus. The speakers are good quality. The camera is crazy good for a phone. Fast, good detail, tons of options. Maybe the only area it could improve is low light but that is expected. Video quality is great too. Smooth, sharp and good stabilization options. There is probably more that I'm forgetting but I may add stuff in later.As for negatives, the phone is really big (along with every other ""pro"" model from other manufacturers) and most will need two hands to operate (may not fit in skinny jeans). There is no SD slot or headphone jack (which is unfortunately typical nowadays). These are all things I can live with considering the quality of everything else.If you're like me and haven't upgraded your phone in awhile I would strongly recommend this."
1060,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,I have been using ONLY Samsung phones for the last 6 years and I decided to give this phone a try so far it is on par with my s21 ultra in speed camera quality and features all around. I do not regret getting this Google phone and I will probably stay onboard the Pixel train for a long while as long as This device holds up t o my 2 years phone cycle.Thanks Google Good Work!
1061,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"This is my second Pixel, third if you count my Nexus 6 (Pixel predecessor).  Each gets better.  This one is only about 3/8"" longer than my Pixel 3XL.  The width is about the same and I find it easy to grip and work with.  Setup was a breeze using the included file transfer utility.  I did get to choose what I wanted to transfer and what I didn't.  The screen looks great and the speed of the phone is amazing.  I especially like that Google does not clutter up their phones with a lot of junkware.  This is one of my main reasons for choosing a Pixel again.  So far, I am very impressed!"
1062,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"The photo quality is just slightly less than an Apple 14 pro max, and for around half this cost this is a win in my book, the battery life easily lasts the whole day. And I love having a fingerprint scanner. Phone also feels quite durable but I put a case on it still just Incase."
1063,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"Super nice phone, has a nice screen size. Easy to set up and use. Navigation is super smooth, picture and sound quality is really good on this phone. Has everything you'd expect and overall a really nice affordable phone!"
1064,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"I fell for the hype and bought this phone. Keep in mind i have a galaxy s20 for about 4 years now, it works well but battery life has degraded. So just taking the phone out of the box it feels like a tank, so heavy and bulky, no way you are fitting this in your pocket. Large not in a good way, camera quality was disappointing, same as my old Samsung. Was fairly fast but it felt cheap, i couldn't see it in person so i bought it and now i had to send it back. Make sure you look at before you buy."
1065,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"Google will not honor their warranty and send it reburbished items when you are told they are new. Phones malfunction a lotYou will never speak to a supervisor unless it's by email and it comes from a generic outbox, never a specific person."
1066,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,Really disappointed with this phone. Paid over 1000 for it and it performs life a cheap 100 tracfone. I am unable to register a fingerprint because of the time out limit and there is at least a 5 second delay when pressing the power button to the lock screen. This was an upgrade from the note 9 and now I returning this and going back to the 9 until the S22 ultra becomes cheaper.
1067,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"Google takes another step closer to perfection but doesn't quite get there because...On the negative side:* Screen is still curved on sides (all flat would be better and allow easier/better use of glass screen protectors)... this is my biggest 'complaint'.* Still some bugs (but much better than Android 12 with Pixel 6's)* Face unlock is not good/secure enough for payments because it's based on a single 2D camera* Phone is quite slippery and top-heavy (and heavy in general) and I feel like I almost dropped it a few times... so you should definitely get a good case for it* Cinematic blur is pretty bad... too much blur and too fake looking with too many ugly artifactsFortunately I haven't found any significant complaints like there were with last year's Pixel 6's. The above issues are mostly minor although the curved screen bothers me the most.On the average/mediocre side:* Battery life is decent/good but not greatOn the plus side:* The negatives aren't ""big deals"" like some of them were with the 6 Pro.* Speed and overall performance is very good (as it better be with Tensor G2 and a whopping 12GB of RAM)* Camera performance and quality is top-notch for a phone (when you don't run into bugs)* The 5x telephoto lens is great to have, but so is the ultra-wide and new macro capability* Google software is great and not loaded with bloat and crapware* The under-screen/in-display fingerprint reader is much better than 6 series now (but still not as good as when it was on the back of the phone)* Seems to work fine with the original Google wireless charging standOverall 4.5 stars and rounding up to 5."
1068,Google,Pixel 7 Pro,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.7 Inches,"I am a big guy (6'3"") with big hands and this phone is still a bit much when it comes to size. The phone is huge. I upgraded from a Pixel 3 to the Pixel 7 and I really don't know how happy I am with phone after a couple of days of carrying it. I can't one handed stretch my thumb across the screen to tap on anything for sure. You also better hope that your pants have big pockets. Wore my Levi's out last night and cramming the phone in my pocket was no fun not to mention the huge bulge in my pocket once it's in there. The phone itself is good. Camera does some really neat stuff. However I think they could've squeezed it into a smaller platform."

1070,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"I declined to leave a unboxing video & picture on this one as its the 2nd device I've bought from this store/seller in a month, technically 3 in total from one of their affiliates. So , I'll start with delivery & packaging , in my profession ( CyberSec/OSINT  ) this is very important detail, it will typically tell the rest of your experience. They did great with shipping times, the got it to me early which is always welcomed and as promised came with a very generic charging block & cable and the device that's about it and it all works great!.  I will also say their after market packaging they used was actually very professional and looked great, sealed with care . There was some paperwork on the side I highly suggest reading as its about your warranty and thus is important.  Remember you pay for what you get, especially with Iphones. I use Android and IOS in business,  I bought a brand new 2021 NEW flagship android device for $320 less than this product but what I paid extra for was that Amazon renewed guarantee which not only promises your device to come with certain prerequisites like over 90% battery life etc BUT it comes with a one year warranty as well as a great return policy which is also a year. I saw alot of mixed reviews , and the details is where you need to look . This company/store did a great job. With its presentation,  Now I'm not going to go to deep I go i to a deep review on the device as a iphone is a iphone,  is a iphone. I have owned every model ,this was a replacement for me aside from business use. This would have been 5 stars all around given the check star system Amazon has in place However,  for example the battery I gave 4 stars, it did come with  90% battery in its bank but like most Iphones unless it's a new battery and has been conditioned ( charged ) properly the battery life is not great on any pro model unless it's the max versions but it will do most great and  as expected. The forest green was a color I loved and was out of stock when I bought it new so that was a nice  addition vs the green iphone 12 pro I have which a total different shade of green. So I bought a bundle , a recommended case and some tempered glass screen protectors,  I will say as they are sufficient,  I made a common mistake as I do like to pay for convienance these bundles are not always the most cost effective route. Do yourself a favor & look around, so  my total was about $730 , the phone itself was priced decent enough but remember that tax is going go be a least $50 added to the device. The phone came 100% Factory Unlocked as advertised and in great shape , the only blemish which I wasn't heartbroken about However for that kind of money and knowing how inexpensive it is to fix the glass as I've done it many of times, there was a decent scratch at the top near the top speaker HOWEVER, I am a tad OCD about things like that especially when spending  that kind of money and having actually bought 3 devices Factory Unlocked I have a high standard. I think most people wont take a 2nd look at it. Just a side note, the resell and value system of used Iphones especially are still very off in 2022 considering for another $150 I could've just bought the iPhone 13 NEW. That said, that has nothing to do with this seller or store just a observation as my business is in all tech. At the end of the day,I can o my fairly go off of what I git & my experience.  I am highly impressed and happy with this purchase. This store/seller took great care in its delivery time, its great packaging, everything came as advertised and product for all Intensive purposes is basically NEW. After 3 devices both IOS & Android , I would not hesitate to do business with this company again. Don't second guess these guys , in reality this was a 5 star sale . They did great business and as I said I was willing to pay more as yes you can find this de ice cheaper all day BUT you are gambling , when it co es to stuff like this I can't stress enough you get what you pay for. The device was perfect, again great presentation,  Factory unlocked,ive tested it on over 20 GSM carriers thus far and I paid for a great product but a peace of mind for a full year , it has a great warranty,  and I have no plans of a return but that option is there if you want it . They did great, I am happy and would buy again!"
1071,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"I got mines for a good price around $385. No scratches on the front screen nor the back or the sides. Battery life is good the only side effect I found was that it heats up pretty fast. Every app works perfectly fine. If you are looking for a bigger size phone I wouldnâ€™t recommend the iPhone 11 Pro but I would recommend the iPhone pro MAX just a few dollars more wouldnâ€™t hurt for a good value. It came with a charger and a USB cube but I would also recommend to get a legit apple cord and usb cube to charge the phone. Please read the instructions when you buy this phone, the cheaper ones are the ones that are a little big damaged and the higher prices are the ones that arenâ€™t.Over all I give it 5 stars because it works as great as my iPhone 12 :)"
1072,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,Phone works great...But calls & songs were muffled through the speakers...I cleaned them all myself using a hack from youtube and now it's working great...I just wish they had be cleaned before I received the phone...To me a refurbished phone should also be a clean phone...I didn't find this problem till the phone was all set up and I had made/received a phone call...Thankfully there was a simple fix and it wasn't more complicated...5 stars for the phone and 4 stars for having to do the work myself.
1073,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"Advertisement said 80 percent charged, arrived 20 percent leaving me skeptical. After a charge and the store activating the phone, I have zero complaints so far. It's been a few days battery life is that of my old phone. Also my phone came a day early, that was cool. I was nervous I'd get a bootleg phone a d I did NOT. worth the purchase"
1074,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,I don't know but this product is 100 recommend I receive the phone with a screen protector and no scratches battery life was at 93% but it's okay but one thing is that I didn't come with a Sim tool it only came with the phone and the cable charger and USB port  but I was so scare about the review and everything but everything was alright the phone work good bit I was expecting a bigger size but I still okay.
1075,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"I switched from a iPhone SE to iPhone 11 pro. I bought this iPhone in a rush because who can live without their phone. Phone works great, and all the features work well. No scratches on the device and set up was like new. Exactly what I expected, if hesitant just buy, you will not regret it.Battery percentage was 80 percent capacity when received, which is kinda low, but charger stays charged longer than my last phone."
1076,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"Phone gets too warm when switched on and seems to use up the battery over a period of about 12 hours with minimal use. I take it that after a few charge up operations, this should normalize. Other than that, it works very well with a clear display and reliable functionality. The Otter Box protects the phone magnificently. I am generally pleased with the phone and there is no sign that it was ever used even for a day. Thank you for your reliable product."
1077,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"Iba a comprar el renewed premium por el tema del % de la bateria, sin embargo decidÃ­ por el normal, y me vino en 88% la bateria. La camara funciona perfectamente bien y todas sus funciones, rayones minimos en la pantalla, nada que me afecte. Excelente producto."
1078,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,When I ordered they said that the excellent condition was supposed to be at least 90% but it is 82% which is low having in mind that any phone with a battery life below 80% the battery is going away really fast and 82% percent is not really far from that/
1079,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,The phone is great so far. Only had it a few weeks. Battery has good life and charges fast. The camera takes great pictures. This is a great phone for the cost. Would recommend.
1080,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,My son is delighted with it. His previous iPhone was a 7 without any memory left. I have the 12 and they are very similar.

1086,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"I dislike the fact that  the Battery is draining too fast, a part from that everything is working fine."
1087,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,Itâ€™s as good as brand new considering the fact that itâ€™s renewed. Superb face recognition and a long battery life! So why buy brand new?
1088,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,Ordered and received an iPhone 11 Pro (excellent condition). Screen and back glass are virtually flawless and aluminium siding is in great condition. Front screen protector came already installed on phone (a nice bonus).  Battery life is a bit lower than hoped for (83%) but still gets thru day even under heavy usage. Prime shipping went without hiccup and picked up at a local amazon locker. Highly recommend this seller
1089,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,Got this to replace my old iPhone 6 as the battery was no longer charging. The phone was in really good condition when I received it.  Battery lasts all day long to text talk play games/movies and use GPS.  Picture quality is good. I am not tech savvy and was worried about learning how to use the new phone but have been pleasantly surprised.  Easily paired with air pods and now I am always listening to music on my long walks. Love the iPhone 11!  Am happy with this purchase.
1090,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"Look brand new! Was looking for a ProMax,though. Nice phone overall."
1091,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"I received the phone in beautiful condition.  Everything worked and I was pleased with the purchase until I inadvertently forgot it in the pocket of my swim trunks and I stepped into the hot tub.  The phone was exposed to a water depth of about 18 inches for about 5 seconds when I realized it.  I pulled it out of my pocket immediately.  Every lens was fogged with water, and my true depth camera was immediately disabled.  These phones are supposed to be IP68 rated and Apple says it can withstand submersion up to 4 meters for 30 minutes.  My guess is that it was repaired and the seal was not done correctly.  Very disappointing.  I was fortunate that the condensation on the camera lenses eventually cleared, but face-id is still disabled."
1092,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,Excellent!

1097,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,All i can say is..GET THIS!!
1098,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,On a fixed income and needed to upgrade my phone. Found one in my budget and had mostly positive reviews. Will be awhile before I get a feel for itâ€™s performance. Delivery time sucked but thatâ€™s on UPS.
1099,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,The phone works perfectly well! Long lasting battery life for a used phone!
1100,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,Came in great condition only problem was the battery life at 83% but still a great product
1101,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,Neat and nice

1104,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,I havenâ€™t had any problems with my phone and I have created so many memories with this device. ğŸ¤—
1105,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"My dad, who does frequent international travel, has mulitple foreign country SIM cards.  He used to have multiple ""burner"" phones for each country he traveled, but that got expensive and also cumbersome.  He wanted an unlocked, full featured iPhone, but didn't want to pay the price of a brand new i13.This i11 Max has good screen size, good resolution, good cameras and a good processor.  It's not blazing fast or has the highest megapixels like the current gen, but it's good enough... and it has 256 GB of memory.When foreign country SIM cards were inserted, the phone recognized it and we were able to do test texting (foreign country voice rates are really high!) with no problem.The phone had very few scratches and the screen was scratch free.  If you didn't look closely, you'd think it was new.I recommend the extended warranty if you are local (US based), but if you are international, you will probably have cheaper repair costs over seas."
1106,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"I needed to upgrade my phone, but new iPhones are due out soon and I didn't want to buy a NIB phone until that happens. The iPhone 11 Pro is a couple of years old, but it will meet my needs until I am ready to purchase the latest generation. I had recently bought this same model, used, on a popular reseller market site. The experience was terrible. The phone condition wasn't as good as it was advertised to be, not even close. The battery health was poor as well, again, a misrepresentation. I returned that phone immediately (more hassle) and bought one I am using now through Amazon. The experience was as different as night and day. This phone is in excellent condition, and the battery health meets the guaranteed minimum (over 80% capacity).I was confident in my purchase because I know that Amazon makes returns easy.  Didn't need to go there because the phone is great!"
1107,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,Love it
1108,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"I had no problems with my phone at all. Battery life was at 100%, absolutely no cracks or scratches anywhere."
1109,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"Unfortunately I need to keep buying smartphones because they are an essential part of life, but the spying capabilities of these phones are a violation of personal privacy.CAMERAThe camera is the best it's ever been. The photos are incredible. The processing does something to your skin to make it look smooth. The portrait option makes the figure pop out in the frame.SCRATCHINGThis iPhone scratches when just in a pocket and touching normal clothing. I've never used a screen protector and had an iPhone scratch so easily. On reading more, I see this is a common problem with the iPhone 11 and is because they made the glass stronger, which made it scratch easily. Apple should provide a warning on purchase and a free screen protector, but they do not.BATTERYMuch faster than my previous iphone 7. I have leftover charge each day after one full charge overnight.FACIAL RECOGNITION EASE OF USEThis is a downgrade from the iphone 7. The fingerprint sensor was fast. The facial recognition has not added anything to the phone - it's made the phone slower and more cumbersome. ApplePay is not fun to use anymore. The side button is a hassle to double click through a case for Apple Pay.For some reason, Force Touch was removed from the phone. This removes a lot of functions or makes them much slower. The iphone 7 was probably the best iphone Apple made in terms of responsiveness and efficiency.THE APP STOREStill can't read all reviews on the app store for an app. How am I supposed to know what people think of the app?SPYINGDid you know that:-It is impossible to turn off WiFi or Bluetooth so that you can always be tracked-Anyone can purchase your tracker information from private companies and know anything about you-When you give an app permission to access your photos, the people running the app can access every single one of your photos-When you give an app access to your microphone, it can listen to you any time-When you give an app access to your email, it can literally download and read all of your emails-When you give an app access to your location at any time, it probably knows where you live and work-Apps place lots of trackers on your phone. When you charge your phone at night, then is when it's sending out that data. This is the ""background app refresh"" setting on your app. Turn it off to stop the trackers. (to read more, check out the Washington Post article ""Itâ€™s the middle of the night. Do you know who your iPhone is talking to?"")-It seems that Apple plans to improve this with iOS14, but from the description of the features it will have, it will barely begin to cover all the problemsApple should be more transparent and clear to customers on the tracking abilities of the phone. They should make private companies agree that they will not sell your data to law enforcement of the government."
1110,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"The face recognition is great along with the new emoji/ bitmoji face tracking, has three camera in the back for different zoom and detail, it's also waterproof, the sides are rounded and are shiny, and the back of it has a new type of hard cover. It's not too small, nor too big for your hands. The performance is also great for this wonderful looking product."
1111,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"Phone came in slower than originally noted to ship, but not too bad.  iPhone 11Pro is in good cosmetic shape with one noticeable scratch to the screen prior to applying my tempered glass screen protector.  After charging it up fully, found that it lists the battery life at 89%, not the minimum 90% they promise, but not low enough to want to warranty or request a replacement, but enough to knock off a star. Have used the phone for a few weeks and battery life remains at 89%, so it appears to be pretty good and it lasts longer on a charge than the 5+ year old iPhone 7 I replaced. So far I am over all happy with the phone."
1112,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,Worth buying a refurb
1113,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,I have Boost Mobile and wasnâ€™t sure if this would work. But yes itâ€™s unlocked so Boost was able to activate it.
1114,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,iPhone is locked by a different carrier than what I listed in the product description. Specifically purchased from this listing for model and carrier.
1115,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,The phone was in good condition and came with a screen protectorHowever it was on 76% battery health when it was supposed to come with 80+I haven't found any other problems with the phone other than this issue
1116,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"My battery is full charge but when it off the charger it shuts off. So Apple sent me a message advising me, the battery is NOT AN APPLE PART."
1117,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"Purchased a 11 pro reconditioned, visually the phone is absolutely perfect, even if itâ€™s sent in a general box and inside a zip lock bag. They provide a paper clip with instructions to use it as SIM card compartment tool, and up to here is not amazing but acceptable.Phone comes with charger, so a plus for iPhone new standard, only problem, when the ring volume is at max, you can hear a vibration noise from the speaker, we have no time nor options to send it back for such a small defect, so probably will keep it as is unless it gets worse"
1118,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"Glad I picked it over the S22. Bought it from TCR and it came in mint condition, 81% battery health. Would recommend."

1120,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Lo tengo en mis manos desde el 11-10-2022; y hoy 11-11-2022 hago mi reseÃ±a para compartir mi experiencia.Aunque es la primera vez que compro un telÃ©fono con 8GB de RAM, puedo decir que estoy muy complacido con mi compra, ya que mi anterior telÃ©fono tenÃ­a 3GB.En cuanto al espacio de 128GB, me siento bastante bien y conforme, ya que antes tenÃ­a que estar eliminando Apps, Fotos y Videos para tener mÃ¡s espacio disponible.Algo que deseaba tener de un telÃ©fono es el puerto Tipo C, ya que es mucho mÃ¡s cÃ³modo y eficiente; y por suerte, ya lo van a estandarizar, por lo que todos los telÃ©fonos del mundo que salgan a partir de ahÃ­ lo tendrÃ¡n.El tamaÃ±o de la pantalla es excelente, ya que, hace mucho que querÃ­a tener un telÃ©fono con una pantalla de mÃ¡s de 6 pulgadas, ya que asÃ­ todo se ve mucho mejor y ayuda a no forzar tanto la vista.Me encanta la idea de que mantenga las actualizaciones al dÃ­a, asÃ­ podrÃ© sentirme un poco mÃ¡s seguro, ademÃ¡s de la optimizaciÃ³n del equipo, que siempre viene incluida.La cÃ¡mara de 48 MegapÃ­xeles y el excelente Zoom me tienen complacido; solo que a veces pone las fotos como con ambientes que hacen que no tengan la suficiente nitidez y calidad, pero he notado que lo hace cuando el clima exterior no estÃ¡ normal y soleado. La cÃ¡mara frontal tambiÃ©n estÃ¡ muy bien.Ahora puedo jugar mis juegos favoritos con total libertad y movilidad; aunque, hay algunos que siempre exigen mÃ¡s, por lo que, en Ã©se caso, solo me adapto.Se siente bastante bien al agarrarlo, ya que es liviano, suave y fino; y aunque el protector es fino y delicado, le puse un PopSocket para poder agarrarlo con mayor comodidad, ya que se me hace difÃ­cil usar un telÃ©fono sin Ã©se accesorio.Me gusta la idea de que tenga el cristal Gorilla Glass 4; que aunque tengo otros protectores para el telÃ©fono y la pantalla en mi carro de Amazon, me siento un poco confiado de que si se me cae, no se me daÃ±arÃ¡ la pantalla muy fÃ¡cil; ademÃ¡s, me siento tranquilo al poder poner llaves en el bolsillo junto a Ã©l, ya que antes tenÃ­a que tener cuidado y usar un bolsillo exclusivo para el telÃ©fono, para evitar rayones en la pantalla.TambiÃ©n me he adaptado a la nueva forma de usar el telÃ©fono sin botones en la parte de abajo; ya que al tener la opciÃ³n de ""ir atrÃ¡s"" con solo deslizar hacia la izquierda o la derecha en los bordes, es mucho mÃ¡s cÃ³modo, fÃ¡cil y eficiente.Otra opciÃ³n que me encanta muchÃ­simo es la de la ""llave inteligente"", que es el botÃ³n del lado izquierdo, ya que ahÃ­ configurÃ© las capturas de pantalla con un solo toque, ya que hago capturas a cada rato sobre los juegos que voy jugando, entre otras cosas; y la linterna la puse con 2 clics porque al ponerla con 1 se puede activar al meterse el telÃ©fono en el bolsillo o al ser tocado sin interÃ©s de encenderla.Tiene muy buen sonido y se siente bien al escuchar lo que voy viendo y sin problemas de calidad.El sensor de huellas digitales estÃ¡ alucinante, ya que tiene una sensibilidad muy buena.Sin embargo, no uso protecciÃ³n con huella digital por Seguridad, ya que, un PolicÃ­a mal intencionado o un delincuente, pueden obligarte por la fuerza a poner tu dedo o dedos para abrir tu telÃ©fono y robarte dinero o informaciÃ³n que no tienes interÃ©s en compartir; por eso solo uso un patrÃ³n, ya que, aunque alguien intente ver de lejos, es mÃ¡s difÃ­cil seguir la ruta de tus dedos; pero no serÃ­a igual si pones un PIN.Hasta ahora lo Ãºnico que no me ha funcionado de las opciones internas es la del NFC, ya que solo aparece la opciÃ³n de configuraciÃ³n avanzada (en inglÃ©s), pero al tocarla no lleva a ningÃºn sitio; y cuando abro alguna App que permite pagos sin contacto, al buscar la tecnologÃ­a en el telÃ©fono y no encontrarla, se sale.En fin, estoy satisfecho con el telÃ©fono; y con relaciÃ³n al tema de los pagos NFC, deberÃ­an resolver eso con tiempo, ya que hoy en dÃ­a eso es muy necesario e importante y deberÃ­a de estar funcionando con normalidad; aunque, espero que corrijan el error en alguna actualizaciÃ³n.Sin dudas mi compra de otro telÃ©fono mÃ¡s adelante serÃ¡ de la Marca Umidigi, ya que ofrecen dispositivos de alta calidad con garantÃ­a, a muy bajo costo.Gracias por tu tiempo.Gracia y Paz."
1121,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The Umidigi F3 is the perfect mid-range mobile phone for the user who wants a balance of performance and price. This phone has a premium features, more-than-acceptable camera, excellent battery life, and speedy processor.Premium Features: The F3 includes features that you would find in pricier phones.  You can unlock the phone via the front camera or the side button fingerprint reader.  I happen to prefer using the side button over the screen reader on most other phones because of convenience.  The F3 also includes an FM radio receiver built in.  How cool is that!?!  Another capability that you no longer find in most phones is a headset jack.  You have the option to use both wired and wireless headsets.  Although the screen is only 1650 x 720, everything is bright and clear.  Playing non-graphics intensive games has been great with no motion issues.Camera: The F3 triple rear cameras and single front camera are more than acceptable for the regular user.  Selfies turn out sharp and clear and photos with the rear photos have clarity that match more expensive phones like the Samsung S21 (I couldn't believe it either...and my significant other is quite ticked off on how much she spent on her S21...LOL).Battery: The F3 has a 5150 mAh battery, which surpasses almost every other phone out there.  I can easily wait 2 days before having to recharge the phone.  Only negative is that there is no wireless charging.Processor:  This is the biggest surprise for me with the F3.  The MediaTek Helio P70 was fast with no noticeable lagging when navigating apps, playing games, and editing documents.  Granted, the chip cannot handle graphics hogging games, but then, most phones can't either.In general, I would recommend the Umidigi F3 to anyone who wants a phone that provides higher value than the price would indicate.  This would also make a great second phone or one for your younger kids."
1122,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The specs seem good on paper, but it struggles when connected to my car with Google Auto. It's pretty good otherwise, most applications run with no perf issues.The location of the fingerprint reader (part of the on/off button) is uncomfortable - most times I hold it, one of my fingers is there, and the reader tries to decipher it even though I didn't want that.All in all, a mediocre phone that's somewhat disappointing compared to the older S3Pro. The only reason I replaced the S3 Pro is that Umidigi doesn't provide any updates for it, so it's stuck with Android 9."
1123,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Still learning about what all this phone can do but all in all I'm very happy with this purchase. Especially after agonizing for 2 weeks as to what phone to get. I'm glad I chose this
1124,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,First off had a heck of a time getting it to hook up to my wifi.  Kept telling me was connected but no internet. I still tried to open Chrome told me my date and time were wrong so couldn't do a hand off. Here the date was Nov 2004 and was set to somewhere in Mexico. Once corrected that seemed to fix it that!  my old Umidigi was 3 yrs old and the battery was dying. So far so good with getting on US Mobile was a breeze. Will try to update.
1125,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,It's okay.
1126,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The umidigi F3, another umidigi phone entering my household. This has been number 5? So I may be biased, but there's a reason I've identified so well with this brand. They produce quality inexpensive phones. The hardware you get for the price you spend is easily twice as much as other competitors.I know and trust umidigi, they update their software, they support their customers, and they make awesome tech. Trusting a company, especially one that most people haven't heard of, is such an awesome thing.I get a phone with a wonderful camera, good battery life, that's stylish, comes with a case and screen protector, all for less than what most garbage phones in the states ask for.Ask yourself do you actually want to keep buying phones that are overpriced or don't work? No of course not. Umidigis f3 phone works in there U.S they make actually global, global phones.All this on basically stock android too, no horrible software bloat like the major companies I've bought from add into their phones.Give umidigi a try, My house uses them, my uncle uses them, and my friends use them."

1128,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"This is a performance phone for $200. UMIDIGI is a go to phone if you want a cheap phone with high end specs. Well worth the price.. why?Pros:8GB Ram and 128 GB internal storage. Plenty for smooth operation and storageGreat Pictures from Sony Cameras.. my attached pics were taken with the phone. Crisp clear pictures!The short cut button is customizable and really helpful for frequent tasks and quick launch of appsThe humongous battery and fast charging together, they give you a peace of mind for days. Turn off the ""screen on when you pickup"" function from settings if you want to extend batter lifeGlobal 4G network compatibility without loss of speed and reliabilityAudio is loud and clearNo bloatware.. this is very important for meCons:Android 11 - will it ever get to 12?Not a 5G phoneThe finger print scanner is the power button.. it's really sensitive and I accidentally turned the phone off multiple times, while trying to setup fingerprint. I would've also preferred an in screen finger print scannerI'll continue to update this as I use the phone.. overall, I recommend this phone if you are looking for a cheap high performance phone."
1129,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"This phone is a perfect mid-ranger. I believe it's perfect for kids to adults that just want a reliable device that runs without lag. I have been using Umidigi devices for years now. They all still work without issues for all this time. I still use an Umidigi S3 Pro as my Pokefone. This is still a brand that provides a case, a screen protector, and a charger ! The battery lasts all day, the screen is nice and big, and the back looks great. It has a shortcut button that let's you choose whatever app you want to open with a single click. And then you can choose a different app for a double click. I usually pick the flashlight for that. And then a press and hold for a 3rd app. I love that if you choose to navigate with gestures, there is not hint bar like on Pixel devices, yo get a nice full screen. This phone has zero bloat. This phone has 8gb of ram so you won't have any slowdowns. And if you are Android tinkerer like myself, it is very easy to root this device. At this price point this is a no brainer."

Â For 200 bucks ( + taxes if applicable). Umidigi F3 is a great phone for everyday use, with 8 GB memory and 128 Gigs of internal storage, there's no worry of running out of storage because of pics or apps.The battery capacity for Umidigi phones have been at the 5050mAh which gives more than a day of good usage easily too, I have another Umidigi Phone (s3 Pro) for 2+ yrs now which still gives a day plus of usage.Having used this phone for a couple of days now, and haven't experienced any lags or missed touch response.The UX has been kept close to stock and not a ton of default Apps come installed which is great!Easily able to connect to 4G LTE networks ( TMobile and AT&T). Camera quality is good for this price range. The customizable button comes in handy for frequent operations.It also comes with a charger/USB3 charging cable, a screen protector applied and a protector case!!The only thing that I think could have been better was if it came with Android 12, it runs Android 11, I hope that it gets Android 12 upgrade soon.Overall a great value!"
1131,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"If you are looking for ""bang for the buck,"" this is it.  First off, I have to say that I am a bit prejudiced. I've owned a Umidigi F1 Play for several years and it has been faultless.  When I saw this F3 at $161.49 I thought I would try it.  After receiving it I found its large screen, 6.7"", to be bright and exactly the size I wanted.  After starting it up the processor was blazing fast.  Another big plus is the reception.  I have found dead spots with my other phones in my area.  This one pulled in a signal where others could not.  I was disappointed in one area, transferring apps and data from my old phone.  I tried Bluetooth and NFC and I could not connect to my old Umidigi F1 Play.  It may have been me or there was a compatibility issue between the two phones.  What you get with this phone is a good camera, great performance, outstanding connectivity, and an unbeatable price."
1132,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The silver color looks so pretty. Features of camera are powerful and really useful, I like the extrawide angle mode. The screen is big and bright and crisp. Big battery, 8g of memory, 128g of storage, mainstream configuration, smooth operation, clear and bright sound, and importantly no annoying app built in ---- I don't like being forced to cram in a lot of junk. Also commendable is the gift of a beautiful transparent phone case.However, the adapter is always so big due to fast charging.  My power strip is overcrowded  :("
1133,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Iâ€™ve owned several union phones. The phones do not feel cheap or miss essential features. The new f3 actually is a great phone. Is better than the Samsung a series. The photos are quite good, the phone is zippy, the screen is bright and crisp. I am actually impressed. It paired with my watch and no problems with Wi-Fi or lagging in videos. Those phone is actually worth more then theyâ€™re charging. Iâ€™ve given cheaper phones to the kids and they actually prefer this phone and want me to buy one for their birthday."
1134,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Trying to reset access point name information hopefully it will be compatible with TracFone
1135,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Good display for being 720p, easy to hold with 20:6:9 aspect ratio. Beware description says stereo speakers but bottom firing speaker only."
1136,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I like the phone a lottttt, but the matte silver looks a lot darker than the one advertised in the pictures. I'll be returning it for a black one. My Qlink wireless sim card works good in this phone. Great size and price"
1137,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I must admit it is a very nice looking device.  However I'm not sure if it's a 4g or LTE phone. I tried to get it activated on 3 different service providers and neither could get the phone activated. But looked good,  camera seemed nice,  screen was clear but while using super fast xfinity internet it seemed a little slower than I expected."
1138,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Wow wow wow!!! This is a beautiful phone for a fraction of what phones usually cost. Brand new and packaged beautifully. It works like a charm and I am very proud to call this my phone. The more expensive brands are so overrated and they charge too much. This phone is worth it folks!
1139,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,The phone has a great finish and the battery life is insaneits easy to set up just put my sim in and its up and runningthe headphone jack is a plus
1140,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Phone was locked for Boost, but they have made every reasonable attempt to take care of it."
1141,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Battery life is Great! And the picture quality is Awesome, been watching more of my shows on the go. Umidigi has come up Big!"
1142,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Make sure you read everything
1143,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Unboxed, set up wifi, transfer all stuff from my old phone, man I love this phone, up until I put my Sim in. The Mrs got a text from cell carrier that my number was deleted from the account, phone locked up no internet no text, no calls nothing. Att/cricket text said to immediately put my Sim in my old phone or reactivation fees will be incurred. Switch back Sim to old phone call them up they say its a 3g phone, I said no I made sure it was 4g, check imei numbers it's 3g.best of luck this is my 6th umidigi but the last 2 have been no goes because of being 3g but labeled 4g"
1144,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,The battery lasts all-day! Even with me using the phone the entire day it had 17% charge when I went to bad. I bluetooth music to my bedroom stereo and play it all night. Music was still playing when I woke. The phone works lightning âš¡ fast. The facial recognition is nice. Fingerprint is iffy. I have problems with fingerprint readers on every phone I have owned. The F1 seems to be getting better with the fingerprint reader as I use it more. Great phone for an excellent price.
1145,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"It says unlocked to all carriers but,it's wrong and false advertisement because,I took it to cricket and tried to get this phone on with a new sim card .and they said it's not compatible with cricket service so I'm having to send this phone back before I can even get my 200 back so I'm not very happy,and the seller needs put on here who it is and who it is not compatible with because,it's bull crap when you got unlock to all carriers when's it's not so if you have cricket do not buy this phone bc it won't work...."
1146,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"El equipo en general llegÃ³ en buenas condiciones, la pantalla tiene un pixel muerto pero en general el celular funciona bien"
1147,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Really great for the price, I've heard some iffy reviews of camera, but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. The tones are a tad warm, and you have to take the time to focus correctly in bokeh(portrait) mode, but all in all very satisfied. Quick and powerful. I'd buy it again."
1148,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Muy buen celular justo en cuanto a exigencias de organizaciÃ³n y procesacion de programas muy rÃ¡pido con muy buena baterÃ­a y a un excelente precio no le pide nada a los de gama alta
1149,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I love love love this UMIDIGI Smartphone. This is the perfect size. Response is very fast. The look is streamlined. The color, which is a dreamy color RED is not too bright , just right.  Kind of satin looking. The weight is perfect. I am so happy!!! Just get this exceptionally beautiful high end phone."
1150,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Good phone.. Value for money. Bought it for discount.
1151,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,This is not good at all.
1152,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Hasta aora todo funciona perfectamente
1153,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,The camera on this phone is crap. For 48 and 16 megapixal camera. It's cheaply made. And then to compare it with Samsung camera that's just lie and deceptive. Now the speaker not working. It's I rip off. Not worth the cost.  I wanted a phone because my phone stopped working but this is garbage
1154,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Update July 2020.After having the phone for a few weeks, a few dead pixels show up, in the middle of the screen, only noticeable in black backgrounds. They sent a new one with no problem, and I am in the process to returning the old one. The new one is working great so far, we had to go back to metropcs to activate the sim card in the new one, this time they charge us 25 dlls, we like this phone a lot, the battery is durable, the camera is great. I am planning to order another one for my self, this one is for my boyfriend, he works at construction so that is why the screen protector is already damage in the old phone, for normal use it will be fine for a while. I didn't find any good hard case protector in amazon, but I tried at the store the case for Moto G Stylus and it did fit the phone, the only problem are the buttons in the case, they don't match, but I don't mind, I am planning to make a hole or something, because I really need a good sturdy case before my boyfriend crack the phone.June-2020Arrive on time, despite the seller didn't gave any tracking information. The phone works great and the battery life is good, has 1 slot for 1 SIM only, and the 2nd slot is for a SIM or a SD card. Is working fine with metro-pcs, despite we had to go to different customer service places, because in the 1st one they just say that phone won't work with metropcs, they only switch the SIM from the old phone to the new one, of course that didn't work! american cell phones companies married the SIM with the imei, so the company has to do the process first. in the second place, the lady was really helpful and start the process immediately, took like 5 minutes and cost under 17 dlls. I also tried a mexican SIM from movistar and works really good, I didn't even had to add the configuration for APN, to have 4G, automatically did it, not like other unlock phones I had before. The camera is decent, and the apps run smoothly, comes with one screen protector installed and a simple black case, flexible."
1155,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Pones are nice however they donâ€™t work with tracfone.
1156,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Had the Play F1 for 17 months and very happy with the phone for the price. Easily the best battery life of any phone I have owned. Can get over 10 hours screen on time staying between 10 and 90 percent as do not charge to 100 or deplete under 10 to protect the battery. Call quality is good, speaker is loud enough, screen size and colors are great. Camera is just okay, when you really blow up images, the detail is not there. Although I'm comparing to a Pixel 2, so can't expect it. Performance is fine and never noticed any slow functions. I do not game, so no review on gaming.Phone has many bands and have used it in USA and all over Asia with multiple sims and works very well.  Dual sim feature is nice to have."
1157,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Great camera
1158,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I got this and it don't work.  It won't turn on.  They are sending me another one and ifnit don't work I am done with it.
1159,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Great great
1160,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Nothing bad to say except I wish the case that came with it was a hard case. The case is so flimsy. It won't stop it from being damaged if I drop it.
1161,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I love this phone comparing it to the a13 or a11 this phone is way better specs memory and all the specs are great not quite 90hz but the screen is cinimatic viewing beautiful you will enjoy paying games on this device and watching movies and the colors are beautiful love the camera hdr mode and just the detail all the specs you need. Giving this a 5 stars also seller is fast shipping got mine the next day. I really love this device. Good price too
1162,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I am happy with this phone, it is cheap but very nice and fast, the battery lasts a long time"
1163,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I usually wait a whole month after purchasing a phone to review but I've had this phone for only 4 days and I hate it!! When i saw all of these 5 star reviews i was very skeptical because this brand never gets more than 3 stars and now i see why! First, the sound is horrible, so low that whenever I watched a video or movie i had to bring the phone close to my face to be able to hear correctly! I always used closed caption because the sound is unbelievably low!! While watching videos the images often would become very pixilated. The front camera is terrible too! Also whenever a call comes in while im doing something on my phone, the caller ID isn't displayed and I'm unable to answer the call! There are a few other annoying things but those were the most bothersome for me and because of that I'm not keeping this phone and I'll never purchase this brand again!!"

1170,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"My wife, 3 children  and I all use iPhones and have various different models.  My parents use Android phones because they preferred Samsung phone over Apple iPhone.  They are now so used to using the Android phone, they don't want to switch over to iPhone but my dad recently dropped his Samsung phone on a hiking trip and his phone cracked opened and needed to get a new one so I got this as his replacement Android phone until his current AT&T contract ends for new promotional upgrade.  I told him to give it back to me once he gets a new phone later because I can use this as a backup phone incase one of my kids lose or break their phones but he actually loves this phone so much that he might just keep it permanently.  We all have AT&T family plan and this TCL 30 SE worked fine with AT&T service and should work with any other GSM carriers.I helped my dad replace the nano-sim card from old broken phone to this TCL 30 SE then set up his Android phone. I was so impressed with this phone, I played around with it to compared with my iPhone and how they are different from each other.WHAT I LIKE:[+] 6.5"" HD screen is really clear and crisp. The colors look beautiful on the screen.[+] The package comes with the screen protector AND a phone case!  I always had to buy screen protector and phone case separately for all our family's iPhones...[+] There are 3 cameras on the back and the main camera is 50MP while other 2 cameras are used for macro and field depth function.  Yes, 50 megapixels wow...[+] I love the biometric finger print reader on the back of the phone, perfectly placed for the index finger.  You can just hold the phone and touch the reader with your index finger to unlock and turn on the phone screen.  Very simple and hassle free.[+] It also has phone unlock feature with face recognition using front camera as well as PIN code.  Front camera is 9MP and is also very impressive in picture quality.[+] Comes loaded with the latest Android version, which is version 12.[+] I love that internal memory space can be increased with micro-SD card up to 512GB!  This is something you would never, ever see with Apple's iPhones... so jealous[+] The phone feel solid and sturdy when holding, while it's not too big like Apple iPhone Pro Max[+] Great battery life so you don't have to charge every day.[+] Fast and responsive screen and touch.[+] Price!  It's a fraction of the cost of iPhone or Samsung phones.WHAT I DON'T LIKE:[-] I'm so used to using iPhone so I'm very confused when using Android OS so this is not specific to this phone as Android OS is made by Google.  Same reason why my dad can't switch from Android to Apple since he's now so used to using Android OS.[-] It does not support 5G network but this is not a big deal for my dad who mostly uses his phone for calls and always uses WiFi at home.BOTTOM LINE:Easily 5 out of 5 stars.  I am very impressed with the camera and love taking pictures and video with this phone as I use my iPhone to take pictures of my kids all the time.  I still can't believe it has 50MP camera and pictures come out crisp and beautifully.  You rally can't go wrong with this Android phone for the price.  Highly recommend it to any Android phone users."

Â Got this budget phone to use as my secondary phone and also to put an international mobile sim in it. Didn't want to spend a fortune as my primary phone is one of the latest iPhones and hence decided to go for this after a friend's suggestion. Overall I am very satisfied with the phone for the features it offers at this price. Comes as a complete package including a case and a screen protector too. I would recommend this phone for this price and if you are fine with the cons mentioned below.Here is my take after owning this phone for a week:Pros:- This phone is compatible with all US carriers mentioned in the description. I tried it with a T-Mobile connection and it works great- It has a good microphone and the sound is clear overall during calls- Screen resolution is good (6.52"" HD+ display with 720x1600 resolution & 20:9 aspect ratio) and usable for most of the needs- Screen is bright and even usable outdoors in sunlight- It has a loudspeaker overall and does the job for most of the needs. Audio works great- Comes with 64GB ROM, however, around 30% of the storage is being used by the operating system itself. But, the SDcard slot lets you expand the storage by 512GB further- It is an android phone and hence supports all the apps that you can imagine (email, MP3, GPRS, FM radio, touch screen, GPS navigation, video player, Internet browser, Google map, etc.). This phone does everything that any smartphone should do. Full-fledged features at this price point- Touch screen is surprisingly good and responsive too. Attached is a video with my attempt to use it- Phone is handy enough to operate. I was skeptical initially thinking about the size of the phone- Comes with the latest android version loaded in it. Hopefully will have the updates also available when the new one comes- Has both fingerprint and face unlock options. Fingerprint unlock is fast enough- The camera quality is good enough for basic needs & especially at this price- Has 5000 mAh battery and should give 2 days of use after each full charge- There are literally no additional apps pre-installed on the phone and come clean from bloatware out of the box. Very user-friendly software- Build quality is nice overall & the phone looks elegant overall- Phone is lightweight overall and handy to use- It is very reasonably priced for the features it offers- Power adapter is included in the package to charge this phone, however, it is not a blazing fast charger- They do bundle a clear case and a screen protector in the package- Comes with 1 year of manufacturer warrantyCons:- It only has the 4 GB RAM and of which 1.9GB is already occupied by the Android system, hence does not leave so much room for heavy applications or games. I wish it had 6 or 8 GB of RAM- Slow charging speed with 15W as per current market advancements- Does not support 5Ghz Wi-Fi network and hence you will be limited with WiFi speed at 2.4Ghz- This is not a 5G phone and hence not future proof- Camera is overall good but picture quality can't be compared to iPhone ones- Not compatible with any CDMA networks. The buyer should consider this before purchasing it- Only 1 year of guaranteed software updates and that could be a big concern for a few picky customers- No IP ratings for water or dust proofing"
1172,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"I've had cell phones for years and I never experienced the problems that I've had just setting up this phone. Continuously locks up into a black TCL logo screen, even in the middle of the setup. I should have listened to the reviews. Returning to Amazon asap. To bad thought I like the styling and features. Update :I was prepare to return this TCL 30se phone back to Amazon for a refund. I have the return bar code on my phone and just needed to drop it off at kohlâ€™s department store. I decided to try setting up the phone one last time. This time I didn't install the sim card or the SSD memory card.  I did a clean install without using the cable to transfer my files from my old phone which is a LG premier pro with Android version 10 to the new phone. I manually programmed every step in the setup process and the phone started working. I installed the sim and SSD card everything connected then I started to delete the unnecessary apps and updated the remaining ones. I loaded the remaining apps I needed from Google play store. I've been using the phone the past several days and I still have 20 days of my 30 days warranty left to return the phone. I don't think the phone is slow at all. But I never had a expensive phone before."

1174,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,the only reason i will not give this phone 5 stars is for 139$ its super slow ! what the heck  the Quality and and pictures are AMAZING but the time it takes to do things is just nope  THATS CHINA FOR YA  i guess
1175,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"I have only had Android phones so I can't speak to any iPhone comparisons, but for me this has been a great phone so far. I have had a series of LG's for the last few years and they have all been pretty decent, but my latest LG (K51) was pretty unimpressive from day 1. Slow, laggy, unresponsive and prone to freezing, it mostly disappointed me. Decided to try this TCL based on other reviews and the fact that it works on T-Mobile and shares the same SIM card size as my K51. also got it on sale on Amazon for only 118$ so why not give it a try right? After a week it has been great, good battery life and very smooth and responsive UI setup. Haven't taken a ton of pictures yet but the few I have taken seem decent enough. Face recognition works great as does Smart lock with trusted Bluetooth devices. Swapping  SIMs worked no problem for me on T-Mobile, did not need to visit the phone store at all just switch and go. Based on a week of use I would recommend this very highly for the budget cell phone shopper!"
1176,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"This was meant to be an upgrade to the TCL that I already had but it wasn't really, except for space.  I wanted a bigger screen for better text size reading and it wasn't that.  Google asks you on and on and on to give permission for their take over and don't explain what you are getting into.  SOME Google is okay, but this is a take over.  Has some nice features if you can wade through all the permissions and managing you!  I want a phone that feels like mine and not a company's!  Phones are getting too complicated to be useful!  I want to be in charge of my own life, not turning it over to a take over company who wants to milk you for all they can, and DO because you don't realize what you are getting into.  I was greatly disappointed because I liked my earlier TCL.  And the magnifier on there was a hassle to use, because it was narrow and time consuming to use.  Older people spend money too!  And some are vision impaired and still need a phone.  We're not stupid at all, just need a little help for seeing!"
1177,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"It's been awhile since I last had a TCL smartphone....a few years & it died suddenly. I have now had this TCL 30 SE smartphone for a couple of months now & so far, not too bad.Pros:  Good battery life, decent-sized 6.52"" LCD screen, seems to run fast enough & not very laggy for the most part, rear fingerprint lock/unlock feature, enough internal storage space [128gb] for apps, pictures, videos, music & so on, decent quality video playback on its screen, decent video recorder & 4GB of RAM for light gaming. Cons:  Not so good still photo qualities indoors and only fair photo qualities outdoors. Also, hard to find protective cases for this phone. Overall, it's a pretty good semi-basic smartphone that is nicely sized that should suffice for basic use such as phone calls, texting and looking thru apps. It's not a gaming phone for sure, but mild games will work most likely on this phone. I ordered another one but the 64 GB storage version that otherwise is identical to this version for my other phone I have. 5 stars I rate this phone"
1178,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"Setting up this phone was easy, great battery life, good picture taking, and visually appealing. Speakers are not that good, and WiFi isn't 5Gh (which is fine by me). Overall this is a great phone for such little cost and I love it (Android 12 on this thing is awesome). When I'm listening to music or enjoying videos, earphone's with Bluetooth work great, or speakers, because it's sort of a must have with me when I'm using it."
1179,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"Tried a new name brand to me. I usually only.own Samsung. But, this TCL is almost as good as my old Galaxy. Even let's Samsung Smart Switch move all info into new TCL. Amazing!"
1180,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,It took several days to research for a new phone because it had to be unlocked. The description said it was. However when I received it it said locked by T-Mobile. I have qlink wireless and they do use T-Mobile so I'm waiting for the first of the month for them to upload my unlimited everything to see if it will work via qlink. More to be revealed.
1181,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"This is a nice basic phone. A few details worth noting are that you cannot transfer apps over to the SD card. Also, it seems to take quite a long time to restart the phone. A nice surprise is that the phone comes with a free clear case and screen protector. Pretty cool! Overall, the phone meets the needs for browsing and video watching."
1182,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"Honestly Iâ€™m blown away by this phone. It came in two days, and I was worried it was gonna have a slow responsive operating system but it did not, it is lighting fast and the camera is great quality! It runs on android OS which honestly puts my mind at ease for the most part. Donâ€™t hesitate to buy this phone! Itâ€™s is a bang for your buck! So much phone for a low price!"

Â I got this phone to replace my old one and I love it! This is a great quality phone for a good price and it is definitely the upgrade I needed. It has a super sleek and simple look that I really like. I like carrying around a phone that doesnâ€™t just work great but looks good as well. The phone looks very similar to many other high end phones that are being sold today. It has a pretty large screen which is nice for watching videos or making video calls on it. The battery life in the phone is super good and lasts a very long time. This phone runs much better than other phones at its price.  Other ones Iâ€™ve tried have overheated easily or shut down a lot but this one doesnâ€™t. The screen on this phone produces very clear image and it doesnâ€™t ever lag. The camera quality is actually really good which is great because I love taking pictures on my phone. This phone has a good amount of storage and is more than capable of storing all of my apps and photos. I really like this phone and Iâ€™m definitely glad that I picked it up!"
1184,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"This phone has (unfortunately) given me bad moments, it has a disgusting tendency of rebooting in a random way, when it does a reboot over night, the alarm will not wake me up, and that will get me in trouble each time it happened."
1185,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,Itâ€™s not bad as temp phone or for people not doing a lot.Itâ€™s not smooth if you start installing a lot of apps.Speakers sound is poor.

1192,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"Loved the camera! Phone had lots of memory and was amazing, but one accidental drop taking pictures of my daughter trick or treating (even had the case the phone came with on it) and it completely shattered the screen.

1201,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,I bought this for my son and he loves it. His last phone shattered when he dropped it and he's starting a new job in a little over a week and needed a good smart phone that will be required for his new job. It was definitely worth the price. It'll be time to replace my phone next and I'm seriously looking at getting a TCL.

A 4 pin # set up is best for it is much easer to recall or not type out wrong then letters which #s dodnt and letters do if not do it slowly one at a time like automated call imput menu choices,etc, cuz password on this was the worst small keys of floating Google board, cuz kept getting it wrong & locked out 10 secs and affraid would be way more to total lock out & I can't afford to pay to fix that & also lost lots of money of stimlus etc so like it has many quircks & screen unresponsive online even my bank, etc and so is not the aps but the cell. A terrible one just, cuz of that. ik it'd be. you get what you pay for, I suppose. Yeah so there is that & frustrating. Idk if it's, cuz I dropped it by my bed or what. I doubt it, but according to Google this occurs anyhow.  I have never had something like this or this bad on Android. Hardest cell to figure out. I wish it had been a stylus. I am used to faster easier normal set up but the apps etc on this drop menuu cool yet odd too. I need a flag uppper tier best unlocked not this. Ugh.

1220,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I purchased the F3S to replace my Umidigi A7 Pro which I purchased in 2020. I was reading about this device and could not find it on Amazon.ca but did find it available on Amazon.com. Shipping to Canada was much faster than I had anticipated taking only 4 business days to get to me. I've used the FS3 for a few days now and here are my first impressions. First off the setup was the easiest I've ever had with a phone(not sure if that praise is to Google or Umidigi or both), I was up and running with all my apps downloading in under 5 minutes. The device arrived with the battery at around 90%. There was a system update waiting after the initial setup. If you haven't used a Umidigi device before one thing that surprises me is their continued update support. The day after purchasing this device I received a system update for my 2 year old A7 Pro, a lot of manufactures will stop releasing any updates a year after they are released Umidigi breaks this norm. The packaging was very slick and simple, it did not give the impression that this was a budget device. The device was very secure in the packaging no jostling what so ever. There were also stickers on the front and back of the device showing the features and layout of the phone which was handy. The package also contains a USB Charger/good quality cable(looks the same as the cable that came with my A7 Pro which is still functioning after 2 years). There is also a gel case that comes with the device, it is good quality but I find that it can get slippery to hold, I have ordered two other cases to replace it. The phone operates smoothly for my day to day tasks, the battery lasts me the day and if I forget to plug it in overnight I still have about 20-25% battery in the morning. It can also handle gaming as well(although the device does get fairly warm). The finger print reader has so far been very reliable not many misreads and no lock outs. The shortcut button is a handy feature although one draw back is it will only function when the screen is on. I've set mine up to: Flash light, Camera, Voice Record for single press, double press, and long press respectively. I did have a minor issue with reconnecting to hidden wi-fi networks but was able to resolve this by going into the developers options and disabling ""Wi-Fi scan throttling"" it seems to be a battery saving option, if you don't need to connect to a hidden network you will have no hassles. The speaker is a single speaker it does the job but its not anything special, I rarely use it I prefer to use headphones. The FS3 also comes with a headphone jack which comes in handy when your ear buds die or are misplaced(hahaha). The headphone jack is on the top of the phone and the power cable plugs in to the bottom, I would have preferred them both being on the bottom but its not a big issue. I've trusted the Umidigi brand the last few years and when I needed a new phone I looked to them first because I knew I was going to get the best bang for my hard earned buck. So far I am very pleased with the phone and hope to get a few good years out of it."
1221,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I got this as an ""update"" to my last Umidigi phone - an A11 - because, while I really liked the A11, I've gotten it in my head that I need a phone with NFC capabilities.I'm glad I decided to pull the trigger on the purchase, especially considering the price on Prime day.As always with Umidigi, the packaging itself is attractive, eye-catching, and high quality by itself. The phone inside of that packaging is the same.The screen size is great for watching media and the back of mine is a sparkling black color. All of the Umidigi phones I've had have been made of high-quality materials - both the screen and the rear of the phones are basically impossible to scratch. I'm absolutely *terrible* at holding onto things, so I drop my phone on hard surfaces multiple times a day and keep it in my purse pocket along with my keys. Despite this, I haven't had a screen or screen protector on an Umiidigi phone break or scratch at all.Not only is this F3S fast with its 6gb of RAM, the fingerprint sensor is *extremely* responsive and the battery has lasted me though 36 hours of relatively constant use. The NFC feature is honestly just fantastic. I've used it far more than I probably should have in the seven days I've had it with no problems and I'm so glad they included it on this model.The camera is really nice as well. The shutter speed doesn't have any delay and the image quality is very good. I haven't really had many things to take photos of because the weather has been terrible and my house is a mess, but I got a *really* good picture of my cat in pretty low light (I also included an accidental awesome picture of her from when I was trying out the ""burst"" mode while she was grooming herself in this review even though it's a bit blurred because she was moving lol)The only problem that's come up on this phone thus far is an issue with the notification volume being super loud sometimes, even when the phone is on silent. I did figure out that this is an Android issue (as opposed to a manufacturer problem) because I found the solution on a Pixel forum - for anyone experiencing this, the OS apparently gets the notification and media volumes mixed up. All you have to do is turn your media volume down to fix it. Kind of annoying, but not a particularly big deal.If you *do* happen to have any actual phone problems, Umidigi's customer service is absolutely top notch. They're super responsive and very helpful. I haven't had any real issues since a couple of phones ago, but any time I have needed to contact them (obviously within the year warranty), they've responded within 24 hours (not including weekends) and have solved my problems quickly - including being happy to replace a defective unit."

Â I've had several UMIDIGI phones before, but this one really stands out.  First, it's the right size for me (I'm 6'4"" and have a big head lol).  It fits perfectly in my hand and feels ""just right"" when making a call.  No fumbling with a smallish phone in my large hands, yet fits nicely in my front pants pocket.  It's amazingly light, too.This listing does a great job of describing the features and the reviews do well too so I will only emphasize ones that stand out for my own use.  They describe the screen as ""cinema-like immersive visual experience"" and it no hyperbole.  It is *stunningly* smooth, no shadowing and has absolutely incredible viewing angles.  It has a nice size for video viewing and is large enough to use for ebook reading.  It's actually the first phone that I found reading ebooks to be comfortable on, without eyestrain.It is fast, too.  Boots immediately and is very smooth between apps.  Battery life is really good too, but isn't too much different than my last UMIDIGI phone.  The very best thing is how well the thumb-based fingerprint reader works!!  This is the *ideal* location for a reader, as it is right where you naturally hold the phone and is on the button to open it.  I have never seen a reader work so fast recognizing and how fast the phone itself opens!I have but 3 negatives - this phone is awesome and loaded, so why not 2 speakers in stereo?  The screen is cinematic and gorgeous, and the absence of this is regrettable.  The next 2 are a bit of personal preference - while the camera is incredibly good, I could do with a bit lesser camera to have to have less of a camera bump.  I go caseless (it is gorgeous and made of durable material) and it rocks all over the place when on a desk or table.  While using the included case alleviates this, it still rocks a lot with it on.  Lastly, while UMIDIGI made the ""Beyond Dreams"" tagline less obtrusive than my previous phone, it is still there and just bugs me.  Just go with your brand and perhaps the model number.I tried to get some nice screenshots and a video of the smoothness of it but I cannot capture how nice it is in person.  It's first rate, comparable to the top of the line phones of other manufacturers.  At this price, it is a terrific buy that will serve well for years to come."
1223,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Let's get this out of the way early, once again Umidigi has created a beautiful phone. I chose the 'Starry Black' over the 'Ocean Blue' this time and it's just as stunning as the blue is.Highlight #1 - NFC  - let me repeat, NFC that supports Google Pay, on an inexpensive phone for the U.S.A. market = #Winning.Highlight #2 - A full 6GB of ram and 128GB of LPDDR4X based storage. Storage is expandable.Highlight #3 - 5150mAh Battery. Coupled with the entry level Unisoc T610 Octa-Core Processor, which basically sips battery, this phone should get you through a full day of useage without breaking a sweat.Highlight #4 - 6.7-inch Display. It's crisp and clear and does surprisingly well outside. Ok, the colors are going to be washed out in bright, direct sunlight, but at least you can still read the screen if the need arises.Highlight #5 - Sony 48MP AI Triple Camera. I;ll need to read up and take some picturesHighlight #6 - Still comes with a headphone jack. Bluetooth still doesn't quite cut it for audio performance and I am glad to promote a phone that still includes a headphone jack.Highlight #7 - They have included a wall charger in the box.For us old-school peeps who still listen to FM Radio, Umidigi has included one. And gome one step farther by NOT requiring a headphone to be connected to be used as an antennae - it works without one just fine.A quick stop at some niggling points: the auto-brightness algorithm could use some improvement and Umidigi doesn't exactly provide timely updates, but does seem to release an update to fix issues.Th UI is basically stock Android. No fluff, no extra, duplicated, unneeded apps.Fingerprint reader is integrated with the power button which is on the right side of the phone beneath the volume rockers, and is as responsive and accurate as expected.On the left side of the phone is a 'smart key' (button) that you can use to initiate up to three different actions such as: screen shot; start recording; open an app.I've gotten some pretty good pictures although I haven't tested the 'night mode' yet. There are standard and 'pro' shooting modes along with HDR and some different filters to enhance your shots and selfies.I still don't know how Umidigi continues to roll out mid-range performing phones and feature sets at bottom-tiered pricing."
1224,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Bought this specifically for the NFC and WIFI calling capability. Only after I bought it did I find out it would not work with both my endoscope and Flir thermal USB cameras. Interestingly the Flir camera actually connects and is visible in the program but then immediately disconnects and terminates the program.  This obviously indicates the phone is capable of the connection and appears to be ""coded"" or programmed to terminate camera operation. When I contacted the seller they said the camera will not work and is not supposed to. Thus four stars."
1225,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I got this phone I liked the phone however it was a 3G phone which most companies no longer support it is not a 5G phone which it is listed under  please change the wording on this phone

Â For the price I paid the phone has everything that I need without breaking the bank. It features a large screen, plenty of storage (128gb) and generous amount of ram (6gb). For this price point I had been looking at phones with 4gb ram and 64gb storage.When first turning on the phone I went through the setup quickly. The fingerprint reader is a must have and I set three fingers with ease. Unlocking the phone with my fingerprint is seamless each time without hesitation. I went to the OTA updates and updated the phone right out of the box, took a few minutes and everything was good to go.Having Voice over LTE and Voice over WiFi is great, it helps the call clarity and VoWiFi for when I'm in a poor reception area. Dual SIM is nice so I can use my personal and work line both on the same phone. You can disable the second SIM when not needed (so my work calls don't come in after hours).The 6.7"" screen makes things very easy to read and view. Playing games works very well for the screen size. It would be nice to have a faster refresh rate but I didn't expect this in the price bracket.The processor, gpu and ram make for a smooth experience for everyday use and handled all my gaming tasks without hesitation.The camera takes good pictures but the response time seems a bit sluggish when moving the phone around. But in all fairness I had compared this to my wife's phone which is the S22 and cost over $1000.The battery is quite large and lasts me a few days with work, games and day to day activities before I need to charge it up.Overall I'm quite pleased with my purchase. Getting the features that I need, and performance that I feel will last me a few years if not more before I feel the need to upgrade."
1227,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I come from Blu G90 Pro and wow with 6GB of ram makes a big difference performance. Screen is bright clear video. Game is not too bad but Helio G90 can tell difference in game. Great phone if your looking for clean android user interface. Umidigi F3S is speedy.
1228,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Phone is great for the price and nice looking.  So far it works fine.  Great that it has large storage size.  Camera quality is not very sharp.  Maybe need to adjust setting.
1229,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Overall an excellent phone for the price with some nice features that exceed the price tag. Phone is very similar to other phones classified as mid end phones.The box comes with a charger, USB type C cable, pre-installed screen protector and phone case. The phone has a good macro camera with a screen that exceeded my expectations for the price tag. Also the 6GB of RAM and the ability to lock apps makes it really easy to multi task. There are 2 key features that exceed the price tag of this phone. First, NFC which is something I need in any phone in order to use Google Pay or scan my house and car keys. Second, the Smart Key which is an extra button on the left side of the phone which is also customizable (see pics).Cons:The single speaker is loud enough but coumd be a little more clear."
1230,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The Umidigi F3s runs lag free, The battery is exceptional, it gives me about a day and a half of use, The camera takes vibrant and well detailed photos, the phone display is bright and good at it's price point. There is 6gb ROM and 128gb of RAM enough storage for all your apps, photos, videos and music. I also like the fact that it's dual sim. Overall it's a great phone at it's price point making it well worth the money."
1231,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Everything good, maden with care, packed with accessories and most handy: 3 in 1 programmable button I use for telegram, teams and flashlight."

Â It's hard to find a reasonably priced phone with good features, but this one seems to come through in a lot of areas while still keeping the price pretty low. 128 GB storage, 6 GB ram, 5,000+ mAh battery... It's hard to complain about this phone! The multifunction button is the cherry on top for this new budget offering from Umidigi."
1233,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Nice product with good capture and navigation.
1234,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I pick this phone and was told it works on the Verizon network. But it doesn't.
1235,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I have had it with my Umidigi Power 3 phone! I absolutely will never buy another product from them. From the first it did NOT work as it should on the most basic of functions of a cell phone---making a phone call! (the sound was barely audible on phone calls even at highest level with using speaker I had to yell at all times when making a call). This occurred as soon as I activated this phone. The screen then cracked shortly thereafter from a very SMALL drop of say 3 feet from my back pocket onto the kitchen floor (linoleum tile). I got my money back though. Maybe their newer phones are better...but I just wish someone warned me about Umidigi cell phones as I researched and believed the hype....what do I have now? a motorola and it too is a brand I will never buy again... its got a bad chip issue which makes ghost calls and the  ringer works only when it wants to.....

1250,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The overall design of the phone is really good. I bought the blue version and it's as in the picture. The phone came in a yellow box with a cable, adapter and papers (also a sim card remover).The phone itself is really powerful because it never lags. it has 6 gb ram and a lot of storage (128gb).As you can also see in the pictures the camera is really good, it takes realistic photos and especially with vif colors.Finally the battery serve well because it's quite big (5150 mah).The phone has also nfc which is great.In short, it's a good phone for pretty much anything : gaming, social networks, youtube, photo shooting..."
1251,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Update: 4g stopped connecting and their customer support is a joke. First impossible to contact then impossible to get any answers.Considering prices inflation these days, you will be having a very hard finding a phone that cam do pretty much everything a top liner would do. The price starts at 240$ tax so imagine when they are on a promotion, the price would be even better.First of all the design is beautiful, I mean the colors and the glass back panel. I am not a big fan of iphone like cameras arrangement but that is fine. The front screen has just a small dot on top which serves as a camera.Some people complain about connectivity when they insert a sim card but I havent experiences anything similar. I would suggest to read the manual carefully and contact the seller, I am pretty sure it could be figures out.The fund works as a charm, it has a prety good battery capacity and it allows it to last for around whole day. Depending on usage of course. The camera doesnt take the best shots but they are still decent. Remember the price and lower your expectations. It allows you to surf internet, play games, do your work, listen to music, study, etc. And all that with ease"

1259,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"My wife needed a new phone, as hers was acting up and being unreliable. So I came across this brand, as I remember reading good things about the brand, and reading many reviews and studying the specs. On paper this seems to be a good phone, much better than the Motorola one that my wife wanted to get from Costco for $200. After researching the phone for a while, I decided to order it and give it a try, shipping was fast and arrived the next evening. Opened the box, set up the phone, transfering everything over from the old phone was a breeze. That's where it stopped being a great phone. It couldn't stay connected to WiFi, constantly disconnected without my wife noticing this caused her to go way over her mobile data limit and resulted in a nice extra on the phone bill. Next, call quality was very bad, person on the other end of phone would hear a computerized like voice, with constant cut outs making calls and conversations hard to have. Lastly the camera which is supposed to be 48MP was very grainy/blurry, and the zoom was only 2x which make the picture quality worse.It's too bad since it is a very nice looking phone, maybe I got a lemon, but maybe not. Anyways I returned it after a week of using it without any issues with the return. Didn't want to take a chance and exchange it for another unit."
1260,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"UMIDIGI F3SI spotted this phone and was impressed with the specs to price point.It has a 48 MP camera on the back which takes really nice pictures. I haven't had a chance to take any night pics yet but think that will be good as well. The front camera takes nice selfie pics as wellAndroid 11, lots of internal storage and a spot for an SD card as well.It also has a second sim slot which will come in handy on the next trip down south.I am writing this review on the phone right now and the screen is nice and sharp.I am looking forward to using this as my daily driver."

1262,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Overall, definitely a phone worth it's price. It has good storage and RAM, great battery life, and the 48 mp camera is fantastic. The phone is slimmer and longer than some other phones, allowing it to fit better within my hand, without losing any screen size. The package includes not only the phone, but a simple clear case and a charger (USB Type-C). My one slight problem is some of the UI preferences that I have not been able change to my liking, but I will get used to those over time. As always, UMIDIGI has given me a phone that I very much enjoy with a very affordable price."
1263,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Jâ€™ai commander ce Umidigi comme telephone de backup, mais il mâ€™as beaucoup surpris. Performance / prix trÃ¨s intÃ©ressant. Sont seul point faible est la qualitÃ© des photos. Fonctionnel, mais loin dâ€™un iPhone. Jâ€™en suis satisfait et je recommande!"
1264,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"So far I love it! Very smooth, very fast.  Light weight but not too light where it feels plastic. Audio is good, very clear. Could have a little more bass but not complaining. Pictures are actually excellent. I'm comparing them to my iphone 12 Pro. I'll see how the battery life is but so far its good too. The next thing I would hope to see is wireless charging for this. Comes with its own phone case. But overall, this is an amazing phone for a great price."
1265,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The F3S with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage is a nice step up from the A13S I was previously using. The apps are snappier, able to handle more open apps at once.I know this is a cost effective phone, but my only drawback is the slow response of the screen. You can see the refresh rate while scrolling through facebook and Instagram, but I'm also spoiled with my Pixel 6. The screen is bright, the face unlock is great.I noticed that this F3S supports dual sim, but you have to sacrifice the microSD slot, where as the A13S has both sims and a MicroSD. But with the 128GB you likely won't need the SD anyway.The camera is much better, with the Sony 48MP lens. Still a bit of a lag between button press and shutter though.Again, comes with a silicon case and screen protector pre-installed. Love this.All in all a decent phone. I would recommend."

1267,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,This is best  budget phone  for less price with more features .
1268,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I bought one of these in August and like it so much that I bought my wife one. Great camera on it. It holds a lot of apps and runs all of them great. Lots of memory in it too. I would put it up against other phones that are in the 500-600 dollar range..
1269,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"This is the 3rd Umidgi phone I have purchased over the years. The other two were a Bison and F2 and this was my least favorite of the 3. The phone has a lot of good things going for it spec wise but it was just buggy.PositivesGreat BatteryGood CameraLarge ScreenComes with a case and screen protector includedStock AndroidNegativesBluetooth calls drop every 30 secondsThe speakerphone didn't workThe screen protector was starting to have bubbles on the screen after the first dayRandomly freezeMaybe I had received a faulty product, but in its current state, I would have a tough time recommending this phone until the bugs are fixed."
1270,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"I originally ordered this phone from Target. After a few months of use, the screen cracked (rather easily - I put the phone in my purse and I guess it bumped up against something).  Anyway, it's a good, cheap phone so I reordered it on Amazon.  Arrived with A LOT of bloatware from an obscure cell phone company that was (thankfully) easy to delete.  Phone lags for a second while running graphics heavy games but as a texting/video chatting phone, it's great... just kind of fragile.  I got a better case for it this time."
1271,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"Overall the Moto G Pure is a good phone for the money.I do not play games or take a lot of photos. I do not have a lot of apps installed either. I use the phone for calls, texts, navigation, browsing the interwebs, and using a few apps (amazon, ebay, offer up, banking, health care). For these purposes, the phone is more than adequate. I am VERY happy with the purchase. I was going to use this phone as a temp phone until the new iPhone SE reviews came out. I like the G Pure so much that I might just keep it long term. So, if you have a similar use case, then do not be scared of the reviews showing horrible geekbench scores for the MediaTek Helios processor. Also, the near stock Android experience with no bloatware is refreshing. I like the little moto tweaks, like chopping twice for the flashlight.However, there are some caveats:There is no 5G and no NFC. So no google pay (do you trust google?). The lack of 5G is not a deal breaker for me as my carrier charges extra for 5G anyways.The face unlock is unreliable (boo). I do not take selfies, so it could very well be that I am holding the phone incorrectly when trying to unlock the phone. However, I feel like an idiot moving the phone around trying to get the phone to unlock with facial recognition until the phone gives up and begs me to use fingerprint or PIN unlock. I was really hoping this feature was going to make me feel like I have a cheap iPhone. I was mistaken. This is not a deal breaker, but it is a let down.The storage is a pitiful 32 GB. The OS alone with the preinstalled google aps uses about half of that. So if you have/need lots of apps look elsewhere.  My previous 2017 phone also had the same amount of storage but more carrier bloatware. Still, the 32 GB feels cramped for me and will definitely feel cramped for most people.The OS is android 11. This is already one version behind the current android 12 (at the date of purchase Feb. 2020), but the G Pure is supposed to get updated to android 12 and then that's probably it. This is the reason that I chose the G Pure over the G Play. The G Play has a bigger battery and a more commonly targeted Qualcomm processor. But the G Play has android 10 and will only get updated to android 11. Why does Motorola makes such good phones and have such a horrible update policy? If any Motorola bots are reading this, please note that I would buy a more expensive Motorola phone AND recommend Motorola to others if this were not the case. As it stands, I expect every Motorola phone purchase to result in being abandoned before you even get your new phone in the mail.I know that there are more ""cons"" listed than ""pluses"", but I think some of the ""cons"" would be deal breakers for a lot of people. BUT, overall I am VERY happy with the purchase for my use case and expect to sue the phone for quite some time at the moment. So if you have similar needs, then you should expect to be happy as well."
1272,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,Like it
1273,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"As usual, packed with features  I don't really need. But I'm slowly getting used to it and so far, it's working out. Also a little larger than my last Moto. Next phone I will confirm the size."

Â I bought this phone for my niece, and I bought it as a bundle package case and screen protector. I took a little while to set the phone up, but when it was set up it had a beautiful colorful display and it was very smooth with transitions. The camera wasn't too bad, and the phone arrived vetmry fast and all intact. I recommend buying the person in your life that stay breaking their phones this inexpensive replacement or a new phone just to have. It did come unlocked which is wanted and when I place the sim card in from hello Mobile it worked. Buy this phone immediately."
1275,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,Nothing particularly special.. good phone for a reasonable price.
1276,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,I got this phone to use it overseas and worked without any issues with Movistar in Colombia.  Big screen.
1277,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"Bought ( from Amazon warehouse ) as a bike computer as I did not want to use my iPhone ( can destroy the camera. ) I am very impressed with it's performance for the price. Definitely could be my everyday phone if Motorola could get updates out in a timely manner ( still waiting for Android 12. ) A little slow compared to iPhone 11 - but only if you are concentrating on performance. Face recognition is not good - but finger sensor works well. Nice large display works great as bike computer/navigation ( Speedcycle is very nice for this). 1 hour of Navigation, with 3 bluetooth sensors and display always on uses ~10% battery."
1278,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"I had one these for over a year, buttons broke and bought the same phone again. Tried to break the screen with hammer screen will not break its indestructible. Buttons on the other hand, and speaker is crap."
1279,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"Needed cell phone w/ strong Bluetooth ability.  When paired, unit produced extremally poor sound quality.  Rest of phone might be OK but was not tested."
1280,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"Bought for a grand kid, they really like it. Not too fancy...just enough for teens."
1281,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"This phone is worth more than the $139 price I paid.(Please DO NOT RAISE PRICE) I have had it for a few weeks now and I am very satisfied. I have had $800-$1000 phones in the past. In my line of work, they take a beating. (Figuratively and literally).  This phone has every feature I need to conduct business and use the occasional game or streaming app. The call quality is great. The processor may be a bit laggy compared to higher end phones. (3-21-22 Update: After a few more weeks of use, I do notice that some basic apps are not as responsive as you'd expectI have to exit by pressing the power button (lock screen) and go back in for the app to work again. It happens intermittently. This could be because I easily filled up most of the scanty 32gb internal memory.The lower video quality when watching videos or movies is slightly noticable as well. Still very decent video. Neither is enough to throw a fit over or pay $700+ dollars more. I have already dropped it and cracked the screen protector but the actual screen survived!One thing I do not like is that the power button and volume buttons are on the same side and too close to each other. I keep accidentally pressing the power button instead of the vol. down.(I do have a fat thumb though.) Some make like this button configuration because it allows for easier one handed operation.All in all, this phone is a clear winner and a great value. Well done Motorola but beef up the processor just a tad."
1282,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,Good product
1283,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"This is my first smartphone, and I have no complaints.  The sound is crystal clear, and the touch-screen has the perfect sensitivity, with and without a protective screen cover.  The overall size might be a bit large for some.  I had to get a belt holster for mine.  I could do without the strange ""hello Moto"" greeting each time a call comes in, so I was able to stop that from happening.  The same greeting happens at power-up, but I can get along with that."
1284,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"I replaced my 3g and this phone was a good buy on Amazon. Everything was set up by my carrier including a nano sim card for free. I don't like so much Google, so I just don't use the apps and works fine. I don't leave it on as I carry it for travel so I can't speak on battery usage but it has good clear sound and coverage  And e-mail /texting works on my network."
1285,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"I really like this phone.  I've had it for a few days now, and am impressed with the overall build quality, speed, screen, and sound, especially given the bargain price.  I like the screen for its brightness and crisp display, and the resolution is fine, contrary to some reviews that say it is pixelated.  For the price, this phone is really a great deal.  It's physically larger than I was anticipating, but I've gotten used to it, though it is a little more challenging to operate with one hand.  It's fast and responsive (so far) and has plenty of storage for my needs (32GB total).  I like that it has microphones on the bottom and top, which is helpful for when I hold it with one hand and partially block the bottom microphone (an issue with my previous phone).  The sound quality of the speakers is fine (I use headphones or bluetooth if I want better fidelity), as is the camera (5MP).  I like the features of Android 11 which seems to work smoothly on this phone."
1286,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"I love this phone, it's sleek, the camera is great. Took a second to get used to not having a back button but okay it's now.  Just FYI - it comes with TikTok installed. Two issues: The battery definitely does not run for two days. It's pretty strong so I'm not sure why Moto thought they should BS about it. Also, watching HBO Max on the phone and couldn't find a way to close the app. Had to restart. Kinda weird but this phone is super affordable and well worth the price."
1287,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"Great value and excellent battery lifeIt does not give me enough time to answer it before the call is dropped. Searched for several hours to see if there was a setting, but to no avail."
1288,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,I bought this phone to use for my employers â€œbring your own device â€œ policy since I did not want to mix personal and official data. It has enough memory to handle outlook/teams apps and decent photo quality.I guess itâ€™s good value for money and you shouldnâ€™t complain if you know what you are buying. Donâ€™t expect premium /top of the line performance from a budget phone.
1289,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,This phone would work fine at home and anywhere you could connect to WiFi. If you were anywhere that WiFi was not available you were left with the ability to make and receive calls only. I like to use my phone to help in navigation when in unfamiliar places or to find the best prices on items when away from home. This phone would not let me make any internet connection through my carrier network. It was pretty much useless when WiFi was not available.
1290,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"If you don't need a phone for gaming,this one is great. I love the moto software"
1291,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"I purchased a refurbished phone from Amazon at a reasonable price reduction. Upon inspection, I saw nothing that would indicate that it had been previously used. Solid and functional but I was not looking for bells and whistles. The battery seems good but I do not constantly use the phone either but I do keep it on even when I store it. Two complaints: I don't know how to get rid of the ""Hello Moto"" audio notification at start-up and sweeping the screen up to enter my pin is problematic. I would read other reviews but I would purchase the refurb from Amazon if your needs are modest."
1292,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"This ""phone"" is massive.  I have no pockets that it fits into.  Winter coats will work with it, nothing else does.  It's the size of a brick.  I miss half the calls because I had to put it down somewhere, and then had to go search for it or didn't hear the notification at all.  I have absolutely NO need for such a massive piece. If I want a big screen I'll take a laptop. At least I have a carry case for that. Who makes normal sized phones today, NOT MADE IN china?"

1295,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,After finally getting it working at the fault of Verizon... There seems to be a lot of bloatware that got put on the phone. After that was taken off the phone was fine
1296,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,Works most of the time. You certainly get what you pay for here. Apps constantly crashing. Even with only one app being open. Music plays terribly skipping or buffering. Games constantly lagging even something as simple as chess.
1297,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"I bought this phone to replace my 3 year old Motorola X4. I'm not a Tech geek or phone snob or someone who knows how to work all the bells and whistles on a phone. I just needed a basic no frills phone to make a few calls, surf the web and play a game of candy crush or 2.  I knew this was a cheap basic phone, and I was okay with that. The problem is, this phone can't even handle basic things like opening a website or playing a simple game with out lagging, locking up and freezing. I wanted to write a review using the Amazon app, but the phone kept freezing up and not responding so I had to use my old Motorola just to post this. There is something really wrong with how slow this phone operates and how often it crashes. I tried to take a photo and the phone locked up before I could use the feature. ( I didn't load my old phones info because I was waiting for my husband to help me do it, so all of these issues are happening on a brand new clean phone.)I'm beyond disappointed in this phone, and I feel like I've been screwed over by Motorola. My old X4 performs and works better and never had the lagging issues like this one.These are the things I've tried to do on this phone and been unsussefull because the phone freeze's up.- taking a picture- trying to watch a YouTube video- playing a game ( candy crush, wordhero)- trying to browse a website- trying to open the Amazon app, or most other apps.- trying to open and read emails.I don't know if my phone is defective, but I doubt it. I think this is just a terrible phone, and a huge waste of money."
1298,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"This phone is great as a basic smart phone. Keep in mind it's a budget device and is not top notch with speed. The camera is not good for night shots and it stutters at times. However;  day camera is good along with battery life. All other functions work fine like apps, calls, texting ect. I recommend it as a 2nd phone for basic tasks. My recommendations are you purchase a micro SD for more memory and use Android tricks to make if feel more snappy. I'm happy with it."
1299,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,It's exactly what I was looking for. The screen size and the specs are just great. And you cannot beat the price for what you get.
1300,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,Functional and have amazing battery life.
1301,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"According to many expert reviews, this is supposed to be among the top two or three phones in its price range. Unfortunately, the phone we purchased was defective. It immediately dropped every call to other numbers on the shared phone plan.Four local employees from our carrier and the companyâ€™s tech support could not solve the problem, even after at least three hard resets and replacing the SIM card. We tried another inexpensive phone from a different company, and it worked perfectly.The phone is also much larger than I expected. I didnâ€™t check the dimensions before I ordered, but I was surprised that it was huge compared to my standard-sized iPhone.Even though I returned the defective phone, I think it deserves two stars. It worked fine for calls to and from numbers outside the shared plan, and the screen was large and bright enough for the visually-impaired person it was bought for. I donâ€™t think the problems we had were typical because the carrier reps had not seen these issues with other phones of the same model."
1302,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"The Moto G pure is a nice phone that has no problem doing all the basic tasks.  The back of the phone is textured, and avoids fingerprint marks.

1305,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,I've had the Moto G Pure phone for a few weeks now and so far am very pleased with it. I'm not someone that is easy to please but so far this phone has been great. It's a little on the large size but if that doesn't bother you this phone is a great value.
1306,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"This is physically a very nice phone but the two star review is in regards to the compatibility with networks.  The listing states that this phone is completely unlocked for all carriers, both CDMA and GSM.  However, the phone I received could not be activated on CDMA providers.  I attempted to activate on Total Wireless and was told this phone was not compatible, even though the listing clearly states Total Wireless is a compatible carrier.  Also attempted to activate on Visible, which is a Verizon company and was told again that this phone is not compatible.  Finally able to activate using Tello, which is a GSM provider.  First time I've had this trouble with an unlocked phone purchased from Amazon.  Unsure if this was just a problem with this particular phone or a consistent problem with this model.  Good luck!!"
1307,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,But the phone for a birthday present for our family member. Gave it to them as they were excited to get it going it seems to be locked to AT&t. Not an unlocked phone. I tried doing several things in settings to see if that would help as we're a little bit educated on some of that stuff but not enough because we could not unlock the phone ourselves either. Very disappointing as it was a present and we called the number listed for tech support and no one would answer several times.

1312,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,Don't do it people. Runnnnn I have had my phone 6 months and just don't ever know what's going on with it.
1313,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"Purchased due to sudden death of old phone and this one being in stock with a same day delivery for only $10 more from Amazon. This all occurred on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving so it was nice to place the order at 9am and have it in my hands and up and running by 9pm and not even having to leave the house.Great phone, NO, a long ways from it, but will likely repurposed to serve as a backup phone once I buy a better phone in the future. This one is slow and hangs. Not impressed at all, but it works."
1314,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"For the affordable price, I'm mostly happy with my purchase.My only complaint is that the phone sometimes has trouble staying connected to WiFi. Several times a day, the phone will randomly disconnect from our home WiFi internet, and it's annoying."
1315,Motorola,Moto G Pure,32 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"The battery on a full charge when checked seemingly lasted until the following afternoon, which is really good for battery life."

1320,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,"I got my Pixel 7 a few days ago from Amazon and I have to say I'm impressed. I'm upgrading from a OnePlus 6T, so keep that in mind when reading my review. I haven't had any problems. powering it up the first time and transferring all my data from my old phone worked like a charm (better than on my wife's Pixel 6A, which had a couple of glitches during the process). Setup took a while, mainly because I have a ton of apps that I needed to sign on to. I've got almost everything done now, except for the most annoying apps (Okta verify, I'm looking at you). The only issue I had during setup was turning WiFi calling on--it failed twice, then I realized the bad reception in my basement was to blame. When I did it from my living room, where reception is good, it turned on without a problem.In daily use, the phone has worked flawlessly. Face unlock is fast (albeit not as secure as a fingerprint because it only uses the regular camera, unlike on the iPhone). The fingerprint reader has yet to fail to recognize my finger, and it's faster than the one on my old OnePlus. The phone feels snappier than my old one, particularly when running certain apps that slowed down my old phone (Instacart, for example).The screen is a beauty--coming from a 60Hz screen, 90Hz is a noticeable upgrade and feels buttery smooth. It's bright enough to use easily in direct sunlight.The camera is very good, from what I can tell. Definitely way better than my old phone's. I haven't taken many night or low-light shots yet, but everything else has come out looking great.I know the Pixel 6 was glitchy and, in some cases, got buggier as time went on. Fingers crossed this won't happen with the 7, but so far so good.Overall, I can't believe the amount of stuff the phone has to offer for the price, particularly with the $100 gift card pre-order offer. It's a flagship phone for a mid-tier price. I was considering getting an iPhone 13, but opted for the Pixel 7 because of the lower price. I'm glad I made that choice, as that extra $$$ comes in handy these days.Edit to add that the battery life is good, but not great. It lasts through a whole day of moderate to heavy use and has about 20% left at the end of the day."
1321,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,"Want to use the fingerprint reader with a screen protector? Nope. I read the reviews, thought they were exaggerating. Nope. I loved the reader on the back of the phone on my 3. Why they moved out is beyond me.Also, my old Bluetooth headphones refuse to work (tozo T6). I've read you can turn the HD audio off and they MIGHT work but sound crappy. I had to buy new headphones. My old ones still work just fine with my work iphone though. So be prepared for the possibility of having to buy new headphones. :(Other than the fingerprint issue and no support for my older Bluetooth headphones, phone seems pretty perfect. Especially for scooping it up for about $500. But man those two issues really burn me."
1322,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,"This phone doesn't deserve any awards but it's not bad. Day to day life feels quick and responsive. Verizon connectivity is good but so far no esim support. Does everything I need it to do.The bad:Fingerprint reader is toilets. Coming from an LG G8 which almost never failed, this has been one a compete disaster. I have redone my fingerprints over and over and it's still a coin flip if I can unlock it.Battery life is nothing great either. Marginally better than the 4 year old LG mentioned above.Is this the best new phone for the price? Probably, but not by much."
1323,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,Battery phone on 8 hrs and now on 99% left.Nice phone while sale price is still kinda high. Coming from a Pixel 2 XL to the Pixel 7 is absolutely worth it in about every possible way.
1324,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,"Best Phone on the Market, Value, Technology! Thank You Google!"
1325,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,Great camera. Great build quality. Amazing OS that runs smoothly on the wonderful 90hz screen. Bright ğŸŒ and beautiful ğŸ˜.  Great bang for buck!
1326,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,"-The screen on this device is really poorly calibrated. It has a very yellow tint that is very noticeable when watching video, it can't display true white (looks creamy) or sky blue (has a greenish hue). The background looks pixelated after unlocking until you scroll, not sure what that's about. If it's attempting to save battery, it's not doing much.-It burns thru battery like the 3 year old phone it was meant to replace.-It gets hot in hand even thru the case just while web browsing.-The fingerprint sensor is basically useless.-I haven't tested the camera, can't trust the colors on the screen anyway.-I would say this is more comparable to a budget phone than it is to a premium device. My previous 2 devices were Moto G variants that I paid significantly less for and was much more satisfied with right out of the box. My wife loves her 4a which is what led me to the Pixel but aside from having a larger screen and a more upscale exterior, the 7 isn't a better device in practice from what I can tell."
1327,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,"Bought this for $499.99 sale thinking it would be an excellent deal. However, just as other reviewers mentioned, the finger print sensor is really bad."
1328,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,"Google Pixel 7 looks like a redesigned version of its predecessor. The battery is less or more the same, less than one day with normal usage (and keep the screen dark, or even less). The fingerprint is like the previous one: terrible - it just doesn't work. They added facial recognition, but not very secure, so it is only to unlock the phone. The price is very good with respect to the other phone, and I don't have a direct comparison with Samsung or Apple, but my old phone, Huawei P20 Pro - launched almost four years ago - has still a better battery, a perfect fingerprint sensor, and an amazing camera."
1329,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,"Comes shipped with Android 13 installed making the phone almost unusable at times, with bugs and glitches. No way to downgrade to a more stable version with out a complete root and flash.Fingerprint scanner barely works even without a screensaver, the less secure face unlock works well even with a picture of yourself. Just use a passcode.Android 13 is by far the worst os.Would not recommend, go with the 6a instead."
1330,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,Pros: Good camera & Speakers. Fast wifi connection.Cons: Finger print scanner doesn't work most of the time. Battery runs out after 8 hours of usage. Consumes a large amount of battery even on idle. Started noticing slow downs within a few weeks of using it where apps will buffer constantly.
1331,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,"This phone resets itself, shut down apps, and freezes."
1332,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,"Overall, the Pixel 7 works well. But the battery life is poor compared to my previous Pixel phones. I have to charge it almost every day, whereas my previous Pixels would go about 2 and a half days. However, charging is fast. The audio from the speakers is quite poor, and the audio via USB isn't much better.  But Bluetooth audio is pretty good. I noticed that the Pixel 7 has the same screen discoloration problem as my Pixel 4a 5G â€” there are rainbow tints when the screen is supposed to be white. I've learned to ignore this. The Pro version does not have this defect. The screen picks up finger smudges like crazy, but I like that the screen is flat (unlike the Pro version). As for the camera, the JPEGs are horribly overprocessed, but you can quickly edit the RAW files in Snapseed to good effect. The phone is relatively affordable, especially with a trade-in. Overall the Pixel 7 meets my needs."
1333,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,Here's the thing...this phone is shaped in such a way that it slides off of everythingBuy a case or break your phone. The camera sticks up so high that the phone is always at an angle without a case on it. Trust me...don't use the phone until you have a case on it.
1334,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,"I've been watching the iterations of the Pixel go by 4a,5,5a,6,6a and finally developed a crack in my 4 and bought myself the new 7.Phones these days don't have anything really revolutionary going for them by the latest and greatest is just a waste of time and money. I'm happy with the 7 and will be glad to have it for the next 3-4 years.PROsMy favorite aspect of the phone is battery life, it is truly great. 5G service is also nice.Do I see a huge performance increase from the 4 .. NOCONsThe 7 is heavier and larger than the 4 and 5 so it's not nearly as pocketable.Face/Fingerprint reader are terrible. 3 out 5 times I just have to enter my pin. I've tried registering many finger prints and adjusting the touch sensitivity. This seems one of its drawbacks. Charging speed hasn't improved, albeit the battery current gen phones should charge faster.If you are happy with your 4-6a, keep it. Battery life is probably the biggest draw to this device."
1335,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,"The unlocked/any carrier Pixel 7 currently does not work with Straight Talk Wireless. After chatting with Google support, I was told they are working on it and anticipate the issue being resolved soon. Unfortunately, my return window will not allow me to wait for their unknown timeline. Hoping this review helps others research before purchasing."
1336,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,Received my Pixel 7 today and it wont turn on. Just gives an intermittent vibration. Tried resetting it per the online help and still nothing. There is no Tech support options at Google so having to return it. Total bummer as I was REALLY excited about this phone.
1337,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,"Let me start by saying Iâ€™ve been an avid Pixel phone user for the past a couple years. Once LGâ€™s mobile division went under (R.I.P.) I eventually found a new home with Googleâ€™s phones. I have owned the Nexus 5, 5x, Pixel 3, 3a, 4, 4a, 5, 6a (briefly used the 6) and now the 7. Out of all those phones, there is no question that the P4 is my favorite with the 4a being a close second. So where does the new Pixel 7 rank among its peers?Easy. Itâ€™s my least favorite Pixel phone to date.FIrst and foremost, the form factor of the 4, 4a, and 5 are simply my favorite. Itâ€™s an absolute shame that out of the dozens of Android manufacturers and hundreds of models of phones, very, very few are the size of these 3 Pixels. Aside from the S22 and Zenfone 8/9, you have basically no choices these days. Even in handling the P7 after using the P4 for a while, it felt unwieldy. I kept wondering if I accidently got the P7 Pro cause it continually baffled me at how much larger it felt compared to all the comparison images and spec sheets I studied prior to purchase. But, the increased size was only augmented byâ€¦The decision to keep the nasty glass. P4 with its frosted glass (white and orange only) was the pinnacle in the series and I see why it's been implemented in so many phones. Feels excellent, looks amazing, resists fingerprints, and is easy to clean. 4a and its polycarbonate shell was almost just as good and felt/behaved very similar to frosted glass, it didnâ€™t feel as high quality but at least was more durable. P5 feels like a damp cereal box and gives me mixed feelings, but better than normal glass. But now in late 2022 with the P7, weâ€™re back to good olâ€™ reflective, scratchable, fingerprint magnet, slippery and/or tacky, glass. I have never used cases on my phones so this matters a great deal to me, but most probably wouldnâ€™t care. Even so, the decision was still made in favor of this.The hand feel and build quality of the phone is not very good either. Itâ€™s easy to notice and feel the edges where the rails/frame meets the glass on the sides, as it rests right against your palm and fingers. The P4 (and many other phones Iâ€™ve used) do not have this problem as the sides are either a solid, uniform piece (like the 4a and 5) or its recessed far enough toward the back of the phone that it cannot be felt. Even with its predecessor the P6, the edges and hand feel were superior on that phone than they are with the P7. Not to mention, I still greatly prefer the design of the P6 with its black bar and funner color options. Holding the P7 just feels like a cheap phone. Again, if you use a case you probably wonâ€™t care.Next up we have unlocking the device. Coming from the P4, Iâ€™ve been spoiled by its magnificent face unlock. Iâ€™ve always preferred a rear fingerprint scanner, up until the P4 began converting me to its face unlock. Itâ€™s super quick, insanely consistent, and can unlock in extremely dim light. P7 has two choices of biometrics to use, face or finger, in which it does neither well especially for a 2022 phone. I canâ€™t tell you how much of a letdown the face unlock is compared to the P4, so I abandoned it relatively quickly. Switching to the fingerprint reveals the same experience like so many have reported, it's super inconsistent. Doesn't matter how many times I re-register my prints, what angles I use, how hard I press, or in what lighting conditions I attempt in. I shouldnâ€™t have to be fighting my phone every time I want to use it.*At this point, I want to point out that with what's been listed, the deal has been broken. I no longer care for this phone, plan on using it, want to keep it, or would reconsider it at ANY price. There is too much competition out there to have to settle for something that I donâ€™t like.Finally, I wonâ€™t delve too much into the software bugs I encountered, as I can see these being updated and patched at some point. I think the strangest, most annoying one was trying to adjust the brightness bar, in which it instead took me into the network settings each and every time. I later read online that if you set the display size to small (I always do), the touch area for the network options will then invisibly overlap the brightness bar, rendering only a tiny portion at the bottom of the bar actually usable. Other than that, I had a few other minor glitchy behaviors such as screen seizures or freezing that was fixed with a restart. Any software issues Iâ€™ve had with the P7 have never happened on any of my other Pixel phones. Even though theyâ€™ll inevitably get patched, the user still has to deal with them for an unknown amount of time.All that being said, this is still a Pixel phone. You are going to get a class-leading camera, the soonest software updates, stock Android without bloatware, and the best Google assistant experience (if you use it). But, if youâ€™re currently on another Pixel phone, then those advantages crumble and you must then entertain the physical discrepancies of the device to a greater degree. Thus, Iâ€™ve concluded I will be sticking with my prior Pixel phones as I do not like the P7â€™s size, build, feel, biometrics, or price. And for those reasons, Iâ€™m out."
1338,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,"I prefer my old Pixel 3. Here's my issues with the Pixel 7:-The fingerprint sensor doesn't work with my screen protector (which seems necessary, especially since I read that the bare screen is easily scratched)-The phone is uncomfortable to use with one hand due to its size and weight.-It is much harder to scroll smoothly. I have to just barely touch the screen to scroll properly.-The back button has too small of a ""hitbox,"" and I often only manage to press it after several tries.-The phone has a 5G emitter.I do like that it is a bit smoother and more performant, but the overall experience was much better on my Pixel 3."
1339,Google,Pixel 7,128 GB,Android 13.0,6.3 Inches,"The reception is really good, my previous phone would get H+ where i live, this one gets LTE and it is fast. Face unlock works great, finger print sensor works great. The battery is all day easy. the screen is nice and bright in the sun. The phone fits nice in the hand and feels awesome. Wireless charging works good. It is not that heavy at all. You get updates the day they come out for android, unlike the other android phones. You have WAY more freedom with the phone compared to apple. Extremely happy with the value for my dollar."

1342,TracFone,TCL Flip 2,8 GB,KaiOS 2.5.4,1.44 Inches,"Well, for a simple phone, this one is more than adequate. It's my preferred phone for dog walks and taking short trips in the car, due to the size and ease of use. And for $20, well worth the price. It took me a while to figure out the setup, especially the Contacts list, but it was up and running in a couple of hours. Flip phones aren't intended for much beyond making calls. Texting is old-style and way too tedious and labor intensive, but it works. Internet access is primitive. It offers some new things my old flip phone didn't have, like battery percentage while charging. I just wish it had a ""store"" to download a few helpful apps, but I can live with that. I say buy it!"
1343,TracFone,TCL Flip 2,8 GB,KaiOS 2.5.4,1.44 Inches,"This is, well, a flip phone! It is what it is. No surprises, exactly what is described. One cool thing I wasn't sure about is that it does come with a headphone jack! Lol I was jamming out to MP3's in no time. Also, one review that made me worry was the person who said you have to buy it at a register for it to work: that person is wrong, they probably saw the ""must be activated at register"" label on the box and then didn't even open it. It does in fact come with an activation card, you can get going in minutes, so long as you have internet access (just don't do it at 2AM lol, I first tried it at that time and it didn't work, worked fine in the morning)."

Not nowadays.  I had to give one star because they don't have minus categories.

I do have a screen protector on it with a cut out for finger print but it doesn't help at all. Also the phone's sim card tray was supposed to have a slot for SD card, well it didn't so I wasn't able to transfer my SD card to my new phone. Google photos is usually my default. I can not set it to save my life. Having a hard time getting photos on my smartwatch 4 as well. Since my SD card isn't available, my photos are not and can't get Google photos to come up on watch... Other than that, I'm happy. Especially for the price."
1359,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"I ordered this phone as a gift for my niece and she was wowed by it's many features including 5G. But she said that there was no SD card slot which defied explanation as I had also sent a 512gb micro SD card. I contacted Amazon and explained the situation but they wrote back with instructions as if, as a current owner of an S20 Ultra and a long time user of Galaxy phones, I needed coaching. However, Amazon apologized for the error and was willing to reimburse me but how was I supposed to return the thing when it was already out of the country!So beware of this should you purchase the refurbished S20 as some models will not support external memory."
1360,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"Needed the fast phone still available with an SD card slot since 128gb is abysmal storage. Strange that this screen is so narrow and long, but still better than buying one of the newer phones that are actually just small tablets.Annoyed there is no 3.5mm headphone jack (requires an adapter). Also the phone itself is designed to slip off of any surface you put it on. Seriously, try to set it down on any surface, it will slide off. Like trying to hold a greased up pig. Another stupid trend in cell phone design perpetuated by all the big brands. You'll have to get a case if you intend to hold the phone in your hand and not let it slide into oblivion. And for some reason the USB c power jack will not stay plugged in. Power usage it high but the battery is large. Still a better deal in terms of performance than any other phone out there."
1361,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"We just upgraded from our old S7's to these S20's.  Love the additional power of the phone, the battery life is easily double the old S7 (even with more frequent use during the day than what we typical did on our S7's).  Screen resolution is super, camera is great.The things we didn't like are:- the phone is slippery, especially with the curved front glass on the long edges of the phone- the slim/lightweight style phone cases that protected the S7 won't protect the front glass on the S20, so you either have to never drop your phone, or you have to get a heavy, bulky phone case, which kinda defeats the purpose of having a thin, lightweight phone- depending  on how you're holding the phone, the curved edge can allow the phone to think that your holding fingers are actually trying to touch the screen and get interpreted as finger presses, which can lead to unexpected things happening on the screen or no action at all when you try to press a screen button or scroll with your other hand (because nothing happens since the phone thinks your holding finger is doing something).  So you have to hold the phone the 'right way' to make sure the screen works.  Unlike Steve Jobs, I don't think you should have to hold your phone a 'certain' way in order for it to work correctly.- The curved edges make the front glass easy to shatter if you drop it front-glass down  (see attached pic).  Even with this little damage to the screen, the screen is half white, which makes the phone completely non-functional.- It costs *more* to replace the screen than to buy a new phone (as of 10/26/22, screen replacement is $270, and the new phone with tax is $230).- The phone doesn't support a micro-sd card.- The phone doesn't have the nifty blinking blue/red/green LED on the S7 that let you know if you had a missed call, notification, or low battery.  I miss that feature.So, while it is a great phone and screen, the practical issues involved in everyday use fall short.  We can't recommend this phone.We are now looking at the S20 FE, which has a flat screen like the S7, a plastic backside (unlike the S20's glass backside), which we think will be a much better choice for our needs.Note that the S20 FE as a new phone cost less than the S20, but the refurb'd FE's cost more than the refurb'd S20's.  I think this is the marketplace voting that the FE is a better practical phone than the S20 flagship.  And the FE front screen replacement only costs $150, which is a deal since you are much less likely to break the glass on the FE."
1362,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"I was very skeptical about buying a ""renewed "" phone from Amazon but after researching several sites and reading all the seller reviews I finally chose one and am not disappointed.  This phone (galaxy S20 5g) arrived as promised in perfect condition, protective packaging. The phone was in the box along with a charger ...that does work,and the pamphlet on renewed products.  The phone set up was very easy I wirelessly transfered all my data and changed service very easily.  Phone was unlocked as promised. I am having a hard time finding a case but its an older model so its ok. Its not the fastest works well and the battery life could be better but it's not bad. It takes beautiful pictures and was a great buy for the price. Do your research and you too can get a good phone for a way better price than other sites and stores."
1363,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"Ordered and received this phone in just a few days. It looks and works like a new phone, I don't see any flaws at all.  Battery life is excellent. I will order again when my husband needs a new phone. Love â¤ï¸ it."
1364,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,The phone is great and works. But they included an incompatible charger with it... Luckily I have a Samsung charger that is compatible with it.
1365,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,At first I was getting static on my end when ga call. This has now gone away. Wonderful support from Samsung and Amazon.  I love this phone. Great quality my pictures and battery life is great. Sti trying to get acclimated to this phone. Can't get my voice messages yet but will in time. Perfect condition no scratches ot bumps. Loving â¤ï¸ this phone.
1366,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"I was super happy with my purchase. It looked brand new, no scratches, no dents. The battery life was great; I ended the day with 20%-30% each day. However, one day I put my phone down for 15 mins, picked it up and the screen wouldn't turn on and it was in a boot loop. I tried to fix it, but ended up sending it back and getting a refund."
1367,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"I could not wait to review my ""new to me"" phone I received today. I was concerned about other reviews but.. WOW! Shipping, it came a week early. It's exactly what I ordered and honestly I can't believe I got it at the price I paid. I've tested everything. The phone is in excellent condition. Slight wear where it was kept in a case but barely visible. The screen is exceptional, no scratches. Speakers perform perfectly. I've already checked the compatibility with t-mobile and it is ready to go which is what I wanted. It is a s20 5g not a different version. It's exactly how it was described. I'm taking it to t-mobile tomorrow and I don't anticipate any issues. I received the pink cloud s20. I love it!Update: took it to t-mobile and it works perfectly! Transferred everything from my other Samsung and it was so easy!"
1368,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"I was pretty hesitant on buying a refurbished phone, because I didn't know what actual condition it was going to be in. Amazon must have very high standards for these companies selling refurbished electronics. My phone came with a fast charging charger and cord, not sure if every seller does this but it was nice to see in the box. After I charged it I put in Verizon sim card from my old phone (Samsung A51), went through the process of setting up the new phone. Samsung makes it very easy to switch everything over from my old phone with the Smart Switch app. I'm absolutely loving my new phone, looks, feels and performs like a brand new phone. And so much faster than my 3 yo A51.If I had to be but picky, the only thing that was slightly annoying was the 28 system updates I had to do to get the new phone up to date. Very minor gripe.Also I'm not sure if this is with all Samsung S20's, but mine is able to run on Verizons 5g Ultra wide network, which is a huge plus I was not expecting"
1369,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"I PURCHASED IT TO REPLACE MY S8 AND LOVE IT.  It's like my S8 with more memory, battery life and capabilities.  Awesome pictures and vibrant screen."
1370,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"Condition rating was ""Good"" no damage to screen, but some scratches visible. True, some scratches are visible but well within the acceptable range. The phone arrived four days ago, sooner than promised. So far, very good. Expect to purchase used phones again in the future."
1371,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"The phone arrived in a thin small box with charger and wire in a padded envelope. The phone appeared to be in new condition without a scratch on it. I put my tracfone sim Verizon card in and worked right away. Tested 5g. With my 2.4 g I was getting 50mbps fastest, with 5g I was getting 350 mbps! I don't like huge phones so this phone is big enough and the resolution and color best I've seen. The highest resolution will use more battery power of course."

1373,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"I purchased two phones, we both love em'. My honey loves the face recognition. Camera A+. Battery life AMaZinG! Handling the device does me justice from my previous bulky phone. Fits nicely in the pockets of my Jean's. I have so much space to download and update Apps with no worries of running out of space. The device gives me more pleasure than it should. I love it."
1374,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"I love the phone. Next month will be a year since I owned the phone, although I am starting to see the battery degrade more. All is good though, I will just have to replace the battery soon! :)"
1375,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,I love everything about this phone it's well worth the price and I'm glad I chose it
1376,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,Phone came wrapped and in great condition appearance wise but the battery is junk thing dies way faster then the last s20 5g I just replaced.
1377,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,Amazing refurbished phone. Phone came with a scratch on top of screen but that didn't effect the way it functions. I would definitely buy from this dealer again in the near future.
1378,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,Was like new condition.  Works perfectly  so far.  Been 4 months.  I'll update if any issues arise.  5 stars.  Im.very happy
1379,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"I would recommend the purchase.  Came in plain white box, phone looked new, everything works as it should.  Very happy with the purchase."
1380,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"250 for a good as new, unlocked, Galaxy S20? no complaints from me. Phone was in mint condition from my perspective. Popped in a Tello sim card and boom, got a very usable phone."
1381,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"The phone was packaged very well to minimize any possible damage that might occur during shipping. The phone was in a generic white phone box I guess and was in bubble wrap. It had the plastic film on the display and around the edges. Since I got a Verizon version of the phone, it did not have a micro sd slot - just a slot that only accepted a nano sim card. And a SIM card was not included, but I got one from Verizon for free. What was included was a 15 watt Samsung charger and USB-C cable, and also a SIM card removal tool.It took about an hour 15 mins - give or take - to fully charge the phone. Everything seems to work well from installing apps to updating software. Very happy with the purchase so far.Note: In case anyone is wondering, Verizon installed the nano SIM card for me and did not charge an activation fee probably because I already have an existing phone line and I was just changing a device on that line."
1382,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,Love the speed and camera
1383,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,I decided to be nice. He really likes his new phone!
1384,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,Have owned it for a couple of months now and have no complaints.
1385,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,Received this cell phone quickly. It looks and functions like new. Set up on our AT&T plan. We're happy. Ordered another one.
1386,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"I miss not being able to screen share to other devices in my home but, maybe I just haven't figured out how yet!"
1387,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"Arrived on time in generic packaging. Battery was dead, I was starting to have doubts. Charged Battery with included charger, no cable. And it has been working great ever since. No problems or issues."
1388,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"TWO PART REVIEW: Vzn model BAD, Unlocked model GOODVZN Model ReviewI was very disappointed to learn Verizon had downgraded their version of the S20 5G compared with the other varieties of this same phone. If you get the Verizon model, you will lose 4GB in RAM memory and the ability to use a supplemental memory card for increased storage. You instead get Verizon's nearly useless variation of 5G, on two small frequency bands that the other models do not have. Most of the time the Verizon phone will be on normal 5G available to everyone, or it will find the widespread 4G signal we all have enjoyed for years. See their coverage map.I deliberately sought out an S20 because Samsung has also downgraded its newer models. The S21 and S22 no longer provide a slot for a supplemental memory card, and neither newer model offers as much RAM as the S20/SM-G981U, to handle multi-tasking apps and maintain rapid processing speeds.UPDATEI have returned the inferior Verizon model, S20/SM-G981V, and wish to thank the vendor ""Re-Sell"" in Colorado for their cordial understanding of my concern. They cheerfully accepted the return, and even offered a discount on a replacement in the variety that I wanted. Unfortunately for them, they did not have that variant in stock.UNLOCKED S20 5G REVIEW FOLLOWSI have found just the right S20 5G that I wanted in the first place. Mint, ""renewed,"" condition. Battery life seems to be as-new, measuring 4000mAh compared with the factory specified 3850mAh. It is possible, but not documented, that this example of the phone has been ""Samsung Certified Re-Newed,"" which includes replacing the battery. Many independent refurbishing places handle these used phones, and there's no way to determine which among them did this particular job. A buyer can only go by the condition of the unit as-received.Using home wi-fi, no cellular service yet, I have implemented all software and security updates for the replacement S20, which apparently was originally sold by T-Mobile. There is a start-up screen with the T-Mobile logo and noise. I'm fine with this initial ""off brand"" startup, before I activate this phone on Verizon with the cellphone number that will come over from my old Samsung Galaxy S7.Historically, Verizon has been among the slowest to roll out security updates and operating system repairs, and I am hoping T-Mobile's branding will get me ahead of simply allowing Verizon to issue refinement downloads when they get around to it.I am now successfully updated to Android 12, with all security patches through Feb 2022 (a few weeks ago).  The function of the phone is exactly as Samsung specified, and the camera User Interface is now set to store my images and videos on the auxiliary storage card that other smartphones no longer provide. This keeps the internal storage of the phone free, maintaining best performance.I will update this review once I activate it on cellular service.  It should be noted that the only reason I am replacing my Galaxy S7 is that Verizon claimed it uses a system it will discontinue later this year. Apparently there's more being abandoned than 3G service, and the type of remaining systems on the S-7 will not work, says Verizon.  Meantime, I'm in no rush to activate the new phone, so I can get a proper protective case around it.UPDATE: Great phone!Activated on Vzn and is working well on cellular and wi-fi. Voice quality has improved over my old S-7. Speakerphone volume excellent. Otterbox Commuter case fits perfectly with good protection.I obtained a fresh SIM card for free at a Vzn retail store, on speculation among Vzn chat workers that older SIM cards may not ""see"" 5G. Unconfirmed,  but since the phone didn't come with a SIM, I decided why not get a fresh one. You will need both the SIM number and the phone's number to activate. Vzn claims they have to manually enter the updated info to associate the new phone with your existing cell #."
1389,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"Phone was in like new condition, unlocked and I had no issues setting it up with my carrier. Phone works fine with no issues, battery life is same as any new phone I have had in the past. Will buy my next phone here when that time comes."
1390,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"The phone appeared to be a locked phone and does not have the dual sim or sd card slot. After contacting the seller, I was instructed how to unlock the phone.  The Bluetooth works much better than my S9, the new phone is much faster than my S9.  It did come with a bunch of Verizon bloatware which I was able to disable and/or remove. The screen has a lot of little scratches but for the most part it's a good phone and is working better than my Samsun Galaxy S9 and I'm happy that I upgraded."
1391,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,I got a good quality one and works perfectly. I was really skeptical but it's really good.
1392,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,there is no user manual!
1393,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"This is a good/bad phone...  Bought for our son. Apparently, he is not able to send text messages something we had not realized because he did not need to use text to communicate.  Does anyone here know how to fix this?  We have tried everything we can think of. The phone can call, receive calls and receive texts and do anything else but..Text!"
1394,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"This phone came a day ahead of schedule (that was pretty impressive). The phone itself is in excellent condition, with no scratches or damage of any kind. The charger that came with it seems to work well, so far battery life is great, and it charges quickly. The camera is the real reason I bought it, and it doesn't disappoint. The pictures are of excellent quality no matter the lighting. I would definitely recommend this seller, and the phone."
1395,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"This phone came in perfect condition and I am loving it! It is fast and true to the description to the most part.My 3 star review is because it said it came with a micro SD expansion, which it does not and that is disappointing as I had my 128 GB ready to go from my last phone. The other thing that was disappointing was the phone charger. Not only was it a generic one (not Samsung), but it didn't charge the phone at all. Luckily I had an old charger on hand..."
1396,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,I love this phone...only disappointment is it does not have wifi calling. I took it to my local AT&T store as advised by an Amazon tech and they said it was not enabled when it was renewed. I ordered this same model phone 2 more times and both did not have wifi calling so I returned. â˜¹ï¸
1397,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,My hubby loved it
1398,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,I read that the camera over softens faces but when I compared it to my old phone it was MUCH better and shows all my wrinkles which is what I was hoping for since I hardly ever take pictures of faces but I can soften them on my desktop if I ever want to.
1399,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"This is a refurbished product so be sure to check through the sellers from where the product is coming. Don't just hit ""add to cart"" and buy. Look through all the sellers reviews. I bought through Edge Cellular. I got exactly what I expected: Samsung Galaxy S20 Cloud Pink Unlocked. Seems to be in perfect working order.One more tip: I'm not sure how other carriers function (i.e. if you can just put your sim card in and go) but for a smooth process, I suggest doing the switch at your carrier's official store. To avoid any problems that may come up. It's t-mobile now, but in the past, Sprint attached the device to my phone number. Every time I changed phones, they had to perform the process in order for me to use the phone, even if it was unlocked. I hadn't made any changes to my usage plan since t-mobile took over and it had been years since I had a new device. When I received my s20, tried switching in my sim but I hit a roadblock that made me think the phone was not actually unlocked. But when I went to an official t-mobile store, I got everything sorted out quickly and happily got to setting up my new Galaxy S20 (^^)"
1400,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"El telÃ©fono funcionÃ³ muy bien, lo he estado usando sin problemas."
1401,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,Exactly as described. Worth the money
1402,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"Delivered phone was an excellent quality Samsung S20-5G, BUT there are variations of this phone which are identified by the last letter of the model No.I received a model SM-981 ""V"" which is not compatible with the ATT network.  The compatible model is SM-981 ""U"".Lots of frustration and wasted time trying set it up until carrier tech identified the model issue.  Phone was returned for refund."
1403,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"I received my phone on time and everything was great until noticing the main mic does not work. I tried msking a video and there was no sound even though i was taking.  I tried navigating the ""Bixby"" but this feature will not work. I guess this is to be expected."
1404,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"I purchased the GS20 in Cloud pink as well as in gray. After recently going to the verizon wireless store and viewing the phones, I noticed that they all looked alike. There really is no major differences in the current galaxy phones on the market except  the camera notch and quality of the camera. It really makes no sense to pay a grand for a cell phone when a newer version of the phone is released the following year and the features from GS20, GS21, to GS22 are not drastically different between all of the phones.So, both of the phones I purchased appeared to be brand new, no scratches on the screen , phones were clean and even the backs of both phones were scratch free and intact. I chose to purchase the verizon compatible phone as opposed to an unlocked phone because I do not plan on changing wireless carriers anytime soon. As soon as I got the phone I was able to activate them with no problems and transferred the sim cards. I had service immediately and had no problems.Both phones came with a charging cable and wall plug and sim slot opener. There was a protective film over the screen of the phone and the phones came in small sized box to fit the phone in. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase; it will be years before I purchase a cell phone brand new. I have to see that the phone is indeed an actual upgrade."
1405,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"A great phone worth the price. The device arrived as described and is very good quality. However, the charger that accompanied the phone did not work so i was forced to purchase an additional one."
1406,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"Great phone, awesome resolution screen. Only downside is the battery life is noticeably less than a new phone."
1407,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.2 Inches,"I ordered the ""good"" quality and it looks brand new and works perfectly. For $179 minus a $40 trade in credit I had this was a steal!!"
1408,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,"The battery life in this phone does not keep a charge for even one day especially if Iâ€™m talking on the phone off & on daily. I charge it every night because the low battery indicator comes on before bedtime every night. I have also been having to charge it at least once a day almost every day! Yesterday, I didnâ€™t talk to anyone all day & it was already at 33% by 4 pm! I had charged it over night to 100%. Ended up having to recharge it around 6! My original Apple iPhone 8 Plus wasnâ€™t even this bad. Put a new battery in my old one & the battery was great but I had other things not working on the phone that I use a lot so needed one that everything worked on. Everything works but the battery life stinks! Seems to me they would make a better battery for Apple iPhones!Forgot to add that it takes forever for the battery to charge!"
1409,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,"It is really like getting a brand new phone. It comes with a generic phone box, generic charger and SIM card remover. I am also excited because my phone arrived a day earlier than expected which was the second day after paying. All things work on this iPhone 8plus as this is a replacement for my broken phone that I really loved. I did the software update and have been good to go. I will buy from this company again."

I will have to eat the cost of replacing the battery myself.
1413,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,I didnâ€™t like the battery life which was at 80% when I bought it.

They arrived within the time element we were told to expect, we were able to get them set up and usable within a couple days.  Our only drawback is that, with the protective shield that goes on the face of the phone, the numbers and and letters are not very sensitive to the touch.  Sometimes we have to really push hard to inter a phone number or type out a text.  The battery life is a major improvement over the 6s units we replaced."

The item description says the battery will have a maximum capacity of 80% or greater and mine showed up with 74%. To me, this is not exceptional condition. The outward appearance is satisfactory but battery life is key and this one doesn't live up to Amazon's promise. I need this phone now so I can't take the time to send it back for replacement. What is Amazon willing to do to make up the difference to me? I have a iPhone cover in my cart I would like and am willing to accept that as compensation."
1440,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,I returned a IPhone from another seller because the screen would not respond to touch.  I then ordered this one.  I am very pleased with it so far and have had it for 10 days.  The phone was very clean and all functions seem to be working fine.  I think that Amazons refurb warranty is great as it gives you confidence that you can return it if necessary and get your money back as I did with the phone that I had ordered from the other which was aIphone Xs.  I like the fact that the 8 plus has a home button!
1441,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,I intend to gift it away.
1442,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,"Bought used in good condition and item arrived in perfect brand new looking condition. Everything works perfectly and Iâ€™m happy with my purchase. And the price was perfect, too."
1443,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,"I got this for my son, he really likes it."
1444,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,It works very well love it
1445,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,I loved everything about this I phone 8 plus . Thank you ğŸ˜Š and the price was very good ğŸ˜Š
1446,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,"3/6/22: phone doesn't hold a charge for very long and like I started before the charging box has never worked. When I got correspondence from seller about screen protector they told me it was explained there was one, I've searched and find no info like that.2nd update 2/14/22: There was a screen protector that came on the phone, that is what was cracking and after we took it off the actual screen was fine. The phone is functioning well and actually better now that the screen protector from the seller has been removed.Update: 2/11/22 Finally getting to the email from the company that is telling me after I had to send pictures that if I send the phone back they will give me a refund..... So my daughter will be out of a phone for how long..?! I'm so mad! The screen is cracking more each day and is almost unusable as well as the fact the glass is now sharp. I would avoid this company at all costs! Obviously they sell a crappy product that will fall apart and cost you more time and energy than just going and buying a newer one. :(My daughter saved up and treats this phone like a baby, yet the small crack it came with is not not the only one now. There are cracks showing up more and more. It's had a screen protector and case on it grub the minute we opened it. It has not been dropped. Faulty screen is all I can think of. Waiting to see if company is going to do anything about it. The charger didn't work either."
1447,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,"I think this would be a great second phone to have itâ€™s the opposite of what I have which is a small I phone , but the amazing big screen was amazing especially on subway surfers it was just slightly heavy now my wrist hurt ğŸ˜”"
1448,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,"Update: contacted seller and they sent a return label to return/exchange the phone. Will update on the replacement to see if battery life is better.Phone looks great, no scratches, marks - looks brand new. But the battery health is 75% and has a message that the health is significantly degraded. Normally used phones guarantee 80% or better. That is disappointing as I will have to replace the battery soon."
1449,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,En buen estado.
1450,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,Works well enough. No complaints besides the price dropped $10 two weeks after purchase.came with charger and protective case. Nice touch.
1451,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,My phone arrived in excellent condition and worked perfectly. I couldnâ€™t be more satisfied.Excellent seller would absolutely recommend highly.
1452,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,My daughter loved it. Looks good. Works well.
1453,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,"Great, but was advertised minimum 80% battery, checking the day I received it showed 77%.  Not enough to return it, but disappointed in battery maximum capacity of only 77%"
1454,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,I like most things about this phone. What I donâ€™t like is when I delete or change an alarm it sometimes leaves a â€˜ghostâ€™ alarm that doesnâ€™t go away.
1455,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,Price
1456,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,Phone was dying fast I had to change battery after that it lasted for I say a good day & a halfPhone was a little glitchy at times but itâ€™s refurbishedFingerprint was a hard thing to do had to keep redoing my finger it wouldnâ€™t recognize it for days at a time
1457,Apple,IPhone 8 Plus,64 GB,IOS 12,5.5 Inches,I ordered one for me & one for my husband. They both work great. The only problem was teaching my husband how to use a smart phone. We love the phones!
1458,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"I bought this phone for work related use. I opted to go the refurbished route given my use case. After looking through my many options and deciding IOS is best for my business use I went ahead and pulled the trigger on this amazon refurbished Iphone XS. I knew what I was going into and fully expected this phone to have some minor blemishes and at least 80% battery.Upon arrival, I was satisfied with the phone despite the phone having much more extensive screen wear than expected AND a pretty poor excuse for a screen protector meant to cover up the screen wear. It is however an old model, refurbished phone, so that is to be expected.Here is the massive flub. The battery capacity.Upon receiving the iphone I promptly turned it on and tested the device, including the battery life. 91%. Given they guarantee 80% I thought I got really lucky and hit the refurbished jackpot.Well, fast forward not even a week and I decided to check the battery life again. 82%????Now I am no engineer, but 9% battery degradation in less than a week sounds excessive.I figured its still above 80%(what was advertised) so I still got the product I payed for. I can live with a shorter battery life.Fast forward 7 more months of minimal use. The phone is on daily with very limited screen time. Work related texts and calls. Occasionally audible, or spotify use.  Monitored all my charging to prevent over charging.Now my battery health is at 60%.Im not sure what rate of degradation is normal but given my use case mine seems to have died unreasonably quickly. I bought this as a cheaper alternative to a new iphone but 300 is by no means cheap and for a device that is quickly dying 8 months later.I am always a bit nervous buying refurbished tech, especially from Amazon.Buying refurbished is a flip of a coin and you may get luckier than me but this left a sour taste in my mouth and left me feeling inclined to leave this review as a disclaimer.In the future I will either buy new, or go the ebay refurbished route given their refurbs tend to be a bit cheaper and come with a 1 year warranty on all ebay certified refurbished tech.Good luck to all those in the market. If you decide to go this route, I hope you get luckier than I did."
1459,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"Bought this from MOBILESUPPLY. I purchased the 'good' quality and was more than happy. Yes, the phone has some scratches on the sides, but that is to be expected from a 'good' quality 5 year old phone. It will be going in a case anyways. Back glass/cameras and front screen are in perfect condition. Face ID works great and the transfer process from my old phone was smooth. Battery health was at 85%, which is again 'good' for a 5 year old phone. I can vouch for MOBILESUPPLY if you can purchase from them."
1460,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,We did eventually get the phone to work.  And now that the phone is more than an expensive calculator/paperweight he loves it.  The battery life is currently 93%  He loves the facial recognition though the mask wearing is a bit of a pain.  Otherwise the phone appears flawless and is safely nested in its new Defender case.
1461,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"Phone came in absolutely great condition! My only complaint is receiving the phone completely dead (no battery life at all) and once turned on and signed in, there is the notifications repeatedly every 15 minutes about the battery is not detected as a genuine apple iPhone battery, but so far within first day have not had any issues regarding the battery.. Iâ€™ll come back with more if anything changes."
1462,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,At first I was debating whether to buy refurbished or a brand new one. But my son speed the process by breaking my daughters phone. So that same day we walked into the apple store an there was no way I was gonna spend 1k on a iPhone so I got her the iPhone X with 256gb an so far we havenâ€™t had any issues with the phone my daughter loves it. Yes I got her a screen protector and a case lol.
1463,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"Great seller and product. Will definitely be buying from them again soon. Only issue was battery health at 83%. I know itâ€™s over the 80% allowed, but only barely. Luckily a new battery is only 69$ from best buy"
1464,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,After buying a different iPhone from another seller and having all sorts of issues I bought a iPhone XS from this seller and it works amazing battery health was 94% amazing quality a small scratch up on the top of the phone and a small screen scratch but besides that I love thy is phone so much and this seller is amazing thank u so much for a amazing phone
1465,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,Iâ€™ve been debating with myself concerning buying a renewed phone and finally decided to try.  The I-Phone XS I bought was in pristine condition and the battery health was at 100 percent.  Iâ€™m so happy with my purchase.  Thank you!
1466,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,the speaker is a bit clogged
1467,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,Todo perfecto pero la baterÃ­a estaba muy deteriorara en el 83%
1468,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"En la descripciÃ³n se menciona que la baterÃ­a tenÃ­a una capacidad de 80% o mÃ¡s y es solamente un 1%, pero la verdad esperaba un poco mas de un vendedor con tan buenas reseÃ±as, por lo demÃ¡s estÃ¡ en excelente condiciÃ³n ni medio rayÃ³n"
1469,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"I bought the phone because my old one blacked out, received this phone five days laterâ€¦ great phone !!!"
1470,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"Worth the money. Only one scratch on the bottom. Given that itâ€™s refurbished, I say itâ€™s a very good purchase. Very satisfied."
1471,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"Not only will you get wonderful customer service, you will be satisfied with your phone! The phone we received is in excellent condition, no scratches,100% battery capacity, quality screen viewing and have experienced no flaws so far! Itâ€™s literally like new! We had some initial questions and the Seller responded so promptly and ensured we were satisfied with our purchase. One of the best interactions Iâ€™ve had with an Amazon Seller! I would definitely recommend to my family and friends! If youâ€™re debating over different Sellers for a phone, this is a no brainer, you will not be disappointed!"
1472,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,IT CAME IN SO GOOD 100% BATTERY LIFE AND IM HAPPY WITH IT AND IM WRITING THIS REVIEW ON THE NEW IPHONE XS 256gb GREY
1473,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,This phone exceeded my expectations. It is like new. I loved it.
1474,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,Was a bit skeptical buying a phone online as Iâ€™m sure everyone would be but Iâ€™ve had the phone for a couple months and never had any problems. Itâ€™s really great and such a good deal
1475,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"The Phone came in excellent cosmetic condition. My only issue is that 80% and more battery capacity was advertised, this battery only came with 74% capacity, which requires frequent charges throughout the day."
1476,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,Battery life is moderate probably 60-65% of new the phone. Used a second phone for work purposes. Shows some odd pop ups that the primaty iphone (on same ios) does not do. It reduced somewhat after running  few upgrades and restarting several times. Does the job as secondary work phone for the price.
1477,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"At this time I have not explored itâ€™s features, but know from a previous version I had , this phone still holds its own in 2022"
1478,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"So phone works and itâ€™s only going to be used on Wi-Fi for my gyms sound system so I can stop using mine. Only slight chip on the back top which, as long as the screen isnâ€™t damaged, I expected being a refurbished unit. But the charging brick is why I took away a star. Thatâ€™s an obvious issue the prongs being bent and could of easily been replaced. Yes this is a refurbished unit but this bricks are a dime a dozen and can easily be given a good one. Thatâ€™s just pure laziness and greedy in my book. But again phone works fine and one cosmetic chip on the back top."
1479,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,Got exactly what I ordered with no problems. Would definitely recommend!
1480,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"I didn't set up the face recognition, so I don't know if it's good.the loud speaker isn't loud, i don't know if it's special to IPhone XS or to this one.Other, I'm happy of that purchase"
1481,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"Good value, competitively priced, excellent condition, as described, excellent battery life.The 264k XS phone came fully unlocked and ready for easy sim card and data transfer from an aging 64k iphone 8.I'm very happy with my iphone XS purchase.I can highly recommended Hybrid IT as an iphone reseller."
1482,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"The phone arrived in its original box and in excellent condition, recommended seller."
1483,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,I have no complaints about this phone. It was as if bought it from the Apple Store. Everything came packaged as described in the original box and the phone worked perfectly. I would definitely purchase again.
1484,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"Shipped very quickly, ordered in ""good"" condition and expected depleted battery life and some visible cosmetic damage. I received a phone with 100% battery health and one tiny (less than 1/4 of in inch) scratch on the back of the phone that is barely noticeable. Plus, I keep it in a case, so it's a moot point. All phone features work well. Great value."
1485,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"I received the phone within 2 days of ordering. The packaging was fine and initially it appeared to be in great condition. However, I checked the battery health on the first day which stated â€œImportant Battery Message: Your batteryâ€™s health is significantly degraded.â€  The Maximum Capacity for the battery was 78%. No problem, I thought, because one of the reasonâ€™s I bought from Amazon is that the phone was advertised â€œto have a battery which exceeds 80% capacity relative to newâ€ and was â€œGuaranteed by Amazonâ€ to be â€œeligible for replacement or refund within 90 days of receipt if you are not satisfied. â€œWell clearly, I was not satisfied to receive a phone with a significantly degraded battery. So, I called Amazon Customer service to explain the problem and request a replacement. I did this on the same day I received the phone. The representative was helpful and told me he would send out a replacement immediately, and even upgrade the shipment method for no extra charge.  He also told me, both in conversation and in writing to â€œuse the box the replacement comes in to return the original.â€  That way, I would not be without a phone while waiting for the replacement to arrive.The day the replacement was scheduled to arrive and but had not, I called Amazon customer service back to inquire about the status. Much to my surprise, I was told the replacement phone order had been cancelled by the third-party seller because the original had not been returned. This irritated me for two reasons: (1) I had never been notified the replacement order had been cancelledâ€”apparently, had I not called Amazon was simply going to drop the issue, and (2) I was specifically told by Amazon Customer Service that I did not need to return the original until the replacement was received.I told the agent this was unacceptable and wanted the replacement sent to me, as had been previously arranged. When it became clear that she would not be able to help me, I asked to speak with her manager. After providing her with my phone number, she said her manager would call me back. That phone call never happened.The following day I called Amazon customer service again, now the third time trying to get this issue resolved. I explained the steps I had taken thus far and was put on hold so the representative could verify if my replacement order â€œwas legit.â€  When I asked what â€œlegitâ€ meant, she said she needed to verify if this was unusual activity on the account because it was a phone purchase. I told her that of course it was legit, as I had email documentation regarding the entire process!After being on hold, she came back and told me the replacement phone would be delivered within 5 days. She also said she would personally call me on that day to verify that it was received. I asked her to clarify that I would receive the replacement first, prior to sending the original back, according to the instructions I had previously received via email. She looked up that email and saw it said: â€œPlease feel free to use the box the replacement comes in to return the originalâ€¦â€  After reading that she placed me on hold again.After a minute or so, she came back on the line and asked if she could place me on hold for an additional few minutes. I asked why. She said she was trying to find out what went wrong with the first replacement order. When she came back on the line, she told me â€œto be on the safe sideâ€ I should return the original defective phone first to receive a replacement.  I reiterated that this was unacceptable and that I had held up my end of the bargain and done exactly as Amazon had told me to do. I wanted the replacement sent first before I returned the defective phone. She said the email I received was in error and the person who sent it made a mistakeâ€”the defective phone would need to be returned before the replacement is shipped out. I told her that while I understand that people make mistakes, I did not think I should be penalized (i.e., be without a phone for at least 5 days) for a mistake that Amazon made. She apologized for the mistake but made it clear that I would not receive a replacement until the original was returned. I informed her I would be writing a negative review.To summarize: I was sent a defective phone, was given incorrect information about how to replace it, had the replacement order silently cancelled without being notified, and Amazon refused to follow through on the terms of their agreement. One star."
1486,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"I love this phone a lot when I got it yesterday it was in perfect condition! No scratches, screen protector was a little bit off but, no worries I got more screen protector! The seller has the best cell phones ever!  I recommend everyone to get it!ğŸ˜Š"
1487,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,Back up to my main iPhone
1488,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"3.5/5 Works good, problem is the screen is replaced with a cheap 3rd party screen. It gets really hot on the bottom half of the phone when under heavy use due to not having a head spreader on the screen. Also phone doesnt recognize it as a ""true tone"" screen and isnt as accurate to touch as original (texting is janky). Battery is 80% health still after 8 months of moderate use which is weird. Possibly spoofed battery health but thats a cheap fix."
1489,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"Itâ€™s a good phone, mine came with only %86 battery life, when it hits %80 Iâ€™ll have to go pay $100 to change/fix the battery. I wish it wasnâ€™t the case, but other than that it saved me spending more than $500 on a phone with decent quality."
1490,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,Came with one tiny scratch on the screen and 81% battery life. Other than that it works.Update: after 1yr 8mo the phone shuts down every 2min constantly if not plugged in to power. Forced to get a new phone. Though any phone for that amount of time with me is about done so not sure if it was a used phone issue or Iâ€™m just hard on my things.
1491,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,Seems good.  Will follow up
1492,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"It looks like a new phone, battery was at 100%"
1493,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,Great! 82% but works perfectly.
1494,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"El celular estÃ¡ en excelentes condiciones sin rayones, ni defectos, la baterÃ­a estÃ¡ excelente tiene 91% de condiciÃ³n. Si sucede algo mÃ¡s adelante actualizarÃ© este comentario."
1495,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"Ok so first things first, I am a big phone guy, especially Apple. so i was awaiting this phone verrrryyy eagerly. i was very worried about the battery life, and how it was going to be. so i actually got the phone 1 day early and i opened the box and i daresay i was very happy. i got a charging brick, a lightning cord, and a sim card ejector! and the phone was in excellent condition. i just notices a few scratches near the top of the phone, but other than that the phone was great! i set up the phone and face id and all that. and i was blown away. this is the first iPhone ive had without a home button, and its so great. the face id is wayyy better in my opinion than the touch id. itsss soooo fast! so anyways i checked the battery health and it was pretty good- being 87% which is pretty good! so yes my opinion is yes you should get this phone. And i was switching from a iPhone 8! so i can tell this phone is wayyy better than that phone."
1496,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"I have to preface the review by saying that I was skeptical when making this purchase because of the mixed reviews. But I did my due diligence on different sellers selling renewed devices and  chose Woot as the seller. I had good experience with Woot when I directly purchased from them in the past.  Amazon Renewed Guarantee provide additional reassurance if something did not go well. (but there's always a catch.. more on that at the end).Product Delivery/Packaging: Very poor1. The product was not eligible for prime for some reason.2. The delivery took more than week but was delivered as committed.3. The phone was packed in Bubble Envelope ...not an Iphone box or any box but just yellow bubble envelope.4. The phone was wrapped in foam cover and then bubble wrap (see picture). Was really surprised the phone survived the transit. Kudos to UPS who handled this with such carePhone and Accessories: Average1. Phone itself was wrapped up in plastic cover and looked almost good, with very lil signs of wear and tear2. Battery was at 86% capacity which again was very disappointing and am not sure how it will hold up over time. I will update this review after using the phone for a few days3. The accessories included were more of joke. Yes, technically there was a charger and a charging cable. I say technically since charger was not an OEM charger and the cable would not reach from outlet to the phone. It was barely 6 inches long. No thats not a typo but it was not even 6 inches.Just Phone: Good(This is not a review of an iPhone XS itself, but the renewed phone delivered)1.  As mentioned above the physical condition of the phone was good. There were very few signs of wear and tear2. It was ATT Model A1920 (MT8X2LL/A), fully unlocked with both GSM/CDMA Support3. I was able to register my apple id and update it to latest firmware.4. FaceID works and that was reassuring5. Screen Quality did not look as impressive as i would have thought from OLED. Need to compare it more. Will update the review.6. However, the battery capacity was at 86% which was concerning since I am sure it will deplete to bare minimum or less than minimum pretty soon. I will update this review and return if things go south soonAmazon Renewed Guarantee: TBD1. I was not aware that there could potentially be a restocking fee if a product is returned. I came across this information thanks to a response from an amazon customer in the Q& A section.2. Though on chat I was reassured by Amazon rep that Amazon would honor or help honor the guarantee within the warranty period.3. So I will update this if i even have to use amazon renewed guarantee. but still this is something to be aware of before making a renewed purchase.Overall, buying an expensive renewed phone can be a dicey affair. Wish there was much better or robust program around renewed phones."
1497,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,The phone's quality overall is quite wonderful and i recieved it at 100% battery but after a two weeks to a month of using it the battery was down to 80% and on the third month 79%. So its a 5/5 really but just beware of the battery (usage)!
1498,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,Fast shipping and the phone had some minor scratches on the ring around the phone. Front and back glass like new.
1499,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"When this unlocked iPhone XS arrived, I checked it closely. Whoever owned this iPhone XS before took very good care of it, probably with a quality case and screen protector. It appears unused. Not even an installed screen protector to hide screen scratches. It came with 83% battery health, which according to the Amazon info on it, is above the minimum 80% for a refurbished iPhone. It came with [as advertised] a generic lightning cable, SIM card removal tool and and charger. All apps I installed work with no issues and the sound quality is as expected for an iPhone XS. It will accept the  iOS 16 update.  I would buy this again."
1500,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,So far this phone has worked as itâ€™s supposed to with only minor screen glitches(I leave that up to the fact Iâ€™ve dropped it already). I ordered the rose gold through Verizon refurbished. I do recommend buying for the quality and price.
1501,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"Bought two phones back in February. One is working fantastically. Really happy with it. The touch screen on the second phone no longer works. Did a forced reboot, which worked long enough to get photos and passwords off the phone. Then it stopped working again. I did 5-6 more forced reboots before I could get into the phone again. Once in, I did a complete reset in settings. Again, worked for an hour and now I canâ€™t get into the phone. Touch screen will not work. (Yes, took the screen protector off just to make sure it wasnâ€™t that.) trying to return this phone for another."
1502,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,"Very impressed when receiving this phone. No scratches or dings, like New. Reasonably price and Perfect for my daughter to use."
1503,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,Iâ€™m a very happy and satisfied customer.
1504,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,We replacement battery
1505,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,Have not had any issues
1506,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,Like new phone - would buy from again
1507,Apple,IPhone XS,64 GB,IOS 12,5.8 Inches,I liked the efficiency in the delivery and the product looks great. It is functioning very well.
1508,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"My wife, 3 children  and I all use iPhones and have various different models.  My parents use Android phones because they preferred Samsung phone over Apple iPhone.  They are now so used to using the Android phone, they don't want to switch over to iPhone but my dad recently dropped his Samsung phone on a hiking trip and his phone cracked opened and needed to get a new one so I got this as his replacement Android phone until his current AT&T contract ends for new promotional upgrade.  I told him to give it back to me once he gets a new phone later because I can use this as a backup phone incase one of my kids lose or break their phones but he actually loves this phone so much that he might just keep it permanently.  We all have AT&T family plan and this TCL 30 SE worked fine with AT&T service and should work with any other GSM carriers.I helped my dad replace the nano-sim card from old broken phone to this TCL 30 SE then set up his Android phone. I was so impressed with this phone, I played around with it to compared with my iPhone and how they are different from each other.WHAT I LIKE:[+] 6.5"" HD screen is really clear and crisp. The colors look beautiful on the screen.[+] The package comes with the screen protector AND a phone case!  I always had to buy screen protector and phone case separately for all our family's iPhones...[+] There are 3 cameras on the back and the main camera is 50MP while other 2 cameras are used for macro and field depth function.  Yes, 50 megapixels wow...[+] I love the biometric finger print reader on the back of the phone, perfectly placed for the index finger.  You can just hold the phone and touch the reader with your index finger to unlock and turn on the phone screen.  Very simple and hassle free.[+] It also has phone unlock feature with face recognition using front camera as well as PIN code.  Front camera is 9MP and is also very impressive in picture quality.[+] Comes loaded with the latest Android version, which is version 12.[+] I love that internal memory space can be increased with micro-SD card up to 512GB!  This is something you would never, ever see with Apple's iPhones... so jealous[+] The phone feel solid and sturdy when holding, while it's not too big like Apple iPhone Pro Max[+] Great battery life so you don't have to charge every day.[+] Fast and responsive screen and touch.[+] Price!  It's a fraction of the cost of iPhone or Samsung phones.WHAT I DON'T LIKE:[-] I'm so used to using iPhone so I'm very confused when using Android OS so this is not specific to this phone as Android OS is made by Google.  Same reason why my dad can't switch from Android to Apple since he's now so used to using Android OS.[-] It does not support 5G network but this is not a big deal for my dad who mostly uses his phone for calls and always uses WiFi at home.BOTTOM LINE:Easily 5 out of 5 stars.  I am very impressed with the camera and love taking pictures and video with this phone as I use my iPhone to take pictures of my kids all the time.  I still can't believe it has 50MP camera and pictures come out crisp and beautifully.  You rally can't go wrong with this Android phone for the price.  Highly recommend it to any Android phone users."

Â Got this budget phone to use as my secondary phone and also to put an international mobile sim in it. Didn't want to spend a fortune as my primary phone is one of the latest iPhones and hence decided to go for this after a friend's suggestion. Overall I am very satisfied with the phone for the features it offers at this price. Comes as a complete package including a case and a screen protector too. I would recommend this phone for this price and if you are fine with the cons mentioned below.Here is my take after owning this phone for a week:Pros:- This phone is compatible with all US carriers mentioned in the description. I tried it with a T-Mobile connection and it works great- It has a good microphone and the sound is clear overall during calls- Screen resolution is good (6.52"" HD+ display with 720x1600 resolution & 20:9 aspect ratio) and usable for most of the needs- Screen is bright and even usable outdoors in sunlight- It has a loudspeaker overall and does the job for most of the needs. Audio works great- Comes with 64GB ROM, however, around 30% of the storage is being used by the operating system itself. But, the SDcard slot lets you expand the storage by 512GB further- It is an android phone and hence supports all the apps that you can imagine (email, MP3, GPRS, FM radio, touch screen, GPS navigation, video player, Internet browser, Google map, etc.). This phone does everything that any smartphone should do. Full-fledged features at this price point- Touch screen is surprisingly good and responsive too. Attached is a video with my attempt to use it- Phone is handy enough to operate. I was skeptical initially thinking about the size of the phone- Comes with the latest android version loaded in it. Hopefully will have the updates also available when the new one comes- Has both fingerprint and face unlock options. Fingerprint unlock is fast enough- The camera quality is good enough for basic needs & especially at this price- Has 5000 mAh battery and should give 2 days of use after each full charge- There are literally no additional apps pre-installed on the phone and come clean from bloatware out of the box. Very user-friendly software- Build quality is nice overall & the phone looks elegant overall- Phone is lightweight overall and handy to use- It is very reasonably priced for the features it offers- Power adapter is included in the package to charge this phone, however, it is not a blazing fast charger- They do bundle a clear case and a screen protector in the package- Comes with 1 year of manufacturer warrantyCons:- It only has the 4 GB RAM and of which 1.9GB is already occupied by the Android system, hence does not leave so much room for heavy applications or games. I wish it had 6 or 8 GB of RAM- Slow charging speed with 15W as per current market advancements- Does not support 5Ghz Wi-Fi network and hence you will be limited with WiFi speed at 2.4Ghz- This is not a 5G phone and hence not future proof- Camera is overall good but picture quality can't be compared to iPhone ones- Not compatible with any CDMA networks. The buyer should consider this before purchasing it- Only 1 year of guaranteed software updates and that could be a big concern for a few picky customers- No IP ratings for water or dust proofing"
1510,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"I've had cell phones for years and I never experienced the problems that I've had just setting up this phone. Continuously locks up into a black TCL logo screen, even in the middle of the setup. I should have listened to the reviews. Returning to Amazon asap. To bad thought I like the styling and features. Update :I was prepare to return this TCL 30se phone back to Amazon for a refund. I have the return bar code on my phone and just needed to drop it off at kohlâ€™s department store. I decided to try setting up the phone one last time. This time I didn't install the sim card or the SSD memory card.  I did a clean install without using the cable to transfer my files from my old phone which is a LG premier pro with Android version 10 to the new phone. I manually programmed every step in the setup process and the phone started working. I installed the sim and SSD card everything connected then I started to delete the unnecessary apps and updated the remaining ones. I loaded the remaining apps I needed from Google play store. I've been using the phone the past several days and I still have 20 days of my 30 days warranty left to return the phone. I don't think the phone is slow at all. But I never had a expensive phone before."

1512,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,the only reason i will not give this phone 5 stars is for 139$ its super slow ! what the heck  the Quality and and pictures are AMAZING but the time it takes to do things is just nope  THATS CHINA FOR YA  i guess
1513,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"I have only had Android phones so I can't speak to any iPhone comparisons, but for me this has been a great phone so far. I have had a series of LG's for the last few years and they have all been pretty decent, but my latest LG (K51) was pretty unimpressive from day 1. Slow, laggy, unresponsive and prone to freezing, it mostly disappointed me. Decided to try this TCL based on other reviews and the fact that it works on T-Mobile and shares the same SIM card size as my K51. also got it on sale on Amazon for only 118$ so why not give it a try right? After a week it has been great, good battery life and very smooth and responsive UI setup. Haven't taken a ton of pictures yet but the few I have taken seem decent enough. Face recognition works great as does Smart lock with trusted Bluetooth devices. Swapping  SIMs worked no problem for me on T-Mobile, did not need to visit the phone store at all just switch and go. Based on a week of use I would recommend this very highly for the budget cell phone shopper!"
1514,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"This was meant to be an upgrade to the TCL that I already had but it wasn't really, except for space.  I wanted a bigger screen for better text size reading and it wasn't that.  Google asks you on and on and on to give permission for their take over and don't explain what you are getting into.  SOME Google is okay, but this is a take over.  Has some nice features if you can wade through all the permissions and managing you!  I want a phone that feels like mine and not a company's!  Phones are getting too complicated to be useful!  I want to be in charge of my own life, not turning it over to a take over company who wants to milk you for all they can, and DO because you don't realize what you are getting into.  I was greatly disappointed because I liked my earlier TCL.  And the magnifier on there was a hassle to use, because it was narrow and time consuming to use.  Older people spend money too!  And some are vision impaired and still need a phone.  We're not stupid at all, just need a little help for seeing!"
1515,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"It's been awhile since I last had a TCL smartphone....a few years & it died suddenly. I have now had this TCL 30 SE smartphone for a couple of months now & so far, not too bad.Pros:  Good battery life, decent-sized 6.52"" LCD screen, seems to run fast enough & not very laggy for the most part, rear fingerprint lock/unlock feature, enough internal storage space [128gb] for apps, pictures, videos, music & so on, decent quality video playback on its screen, decent video recorder & 4GB of RAM for light gaming. Cons:  Not so good still photo qualities indoors and only fair photo qualities outdoors. Also, hard to find protective cases for this phone. Overall, it's a pretty good semi-basic smartphone that is nicely sized that should suffice for basic use such as phone calls, texting and looking thru apps. It's not a gaming phone for sure, but mild games will work most likely on this phone. I ordered another one but the 64 GB storage version that otherwise is identical to this version for my other phone I have. 5 stars I rate this phone"
1516,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"Setting up this phone was easy, great battery life, good picture taking, and visually appealing. Speakers are not that good, and WiFi isn't 5Gh (which is fine by me). Overall this is a great phone for such little cost and I love it (Android 12 on this thing is awesome). When I'm listening to music or enjoying videos, earphone's with Bluetooth work great, or speakers, because it's sort of a must have with me when I'm using it."
1517,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"Tried a new name brand to me. I usually only.own Samsung. But, this TCL is almost as good as my old Galaxy. Even let's Samsung Smart Switch move all info into new TCL. Amazing!"
1518,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,It took several days to research for a new phone because it had to be unlocked. The description said it was. However when I received it it said locked by T-Mobile. I have qlink wireless and they do use T-Mobile so I'm waiting for the first of the month for them to upload my unlimited everything to see if it will work via qlink. More to be revealed.
1519,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"This is a nice basic phone. A few details worth noting are that you cannot transfer apps over to the SD card. Also, it seems to take quite a long time to restart the phone. A nice surprise is that the phone comes with a free clear case and screen protector. Pretty cool! Overall, the phone meets the needs for browsing and video watching."
1520,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"Honestly Iâ€™m blown away by this phone. It came in two days, and I was worried it was gonna have a slow responsive operating system but it did not, it is lighting fast and the camera is great quality! It runs on android OS which honestly puts my mind at ease for the most part. Donâ€™t hesitate to buy this phone! Itâ€™s is a bang for your buck! So much phone for a low price!"

Â I got this phone to replace my old one and I love it! This is a great quality phone for a good price and it is definitely the upgrade I needed. It has a super sleek and simple look that I really like. I like carrying around a phone that doesnâ€™t just work great but looks good as well. The phone looks very similar to many other high end phones that are being sold today. It has a pretty large screen which is nice for watching videos or making video calls on it. The battery life in the phone is super good and lasts a very long time. This phone runs much better than other phones at its price.  Other ones Iâ€™ve tried have overheated easily or shut down a lot but this one doesnâ€™t. The screen on this phone produces very clear image and it doesnâ€™t ever lag. The camera quality is actually really good which is great because I love taking pictures on my phone. This phone has a good amount of storage and is more than capable of storing all of my apps and photos. I really like this phone and Iâ€™m definitely glad that I picked it up!"
1522,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"This phone has (unfortunately) given me bad moments, it has a disgusting tendency of rebooting in a random way, when it does a reboot over night, the alarm will not wake me up, and that will get me in trouble each time it happened."
1523,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,Itâ€™s not bad as temp phone or for people not doing a lot.Itâ€™s not smooth if you start installing a lot of apps.Speakers sound is poor.

1528,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,Surprised me how nice it's is . Ended ordering a couple on another household account. Although one is acting up .
1529,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,It does what I expected it to do -- I don't use a phone as a toy -- or a camera. I use it to produce a product.
1530,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"Loved the camera! Phone had lots of memory and was amazing, but one accidental drop taking pictures of my daughter trick or treating (even had the case the phone came with on it) and it completely shattered the screen. Only had the phone for 2 days. I'm so sad. I can't afford to replace or repair it. ğŸ˜­ Price went up $25 too since I bought it."
1531,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,Phone works okay.  It's a bit slow. Last phone was a bit faster
1532,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,ok
1533,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,Phone looks great.  Sturdy.  Operating system works great!  I don't know about the face recognition or fingerprint reader as I haven't used them.  I would imagine they work well as everything else on this phone does.
1534,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,Good phone
1535,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,It does more than I need a phone to do and has a great camera on it. Excellent budget phone l.
1536,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,This was an upgrade. My old phone was dying. I especially like the camera on this phone. It is a 2022 model with lot's of great features.  The price was also great.
1537,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"The keyboard has a few glitches, no matter which keyboard I download, I run into the same issue. It skips behind the words and not in front of them probably 30% of the time."
1538,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,Good price. Good upgrade for my kid. Time will tell how well it lasts.
1539,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,I bought this for my son and he loves it. His last phone shattered when he dropped it and he's starting a new job in a little over a week and needed a good smart phone that will be required for his new job. It was definitely worth the price. It'll be time to replace my phone next and I'm seriously looking at getting a TCL.

These phones are an upgrade from our last Cricket phones. So we are very pleased, the sound and all other features are great. No worries here these phones will last a good while before we upgrade again. Thanks."
1543,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"but I was surprised, I already knew the TCL brand for their televisions I had no idea that they had cell phones I have been with it for a few weeks and I am delighted it works very well it is fast it has many things it will not have the best camera but in the rest it is great it also looks very fine and modern.not everyone uses the camera a lot but I have no doubt that with a good light it helps it work but it is not so important in everything else this cheap cell phone is very good."
1544,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,I love this phone the finger print security is my favorite part about it. I don't have to remember all those passwords anymore.
1545,TCL,TCL 30 SE,64 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,More phone than I thought I needed. But enjoying having some new features. So far so good. Beats ridiculous cost of a new name brand you can brag to your friends about how much it cost or money you wasted. Does it's job plus more. Very satisfied. Recommend.

A 4 pin # set up is best for it is much easer to recall or not type out wrong then letters which #s dodnt and letters do if not do it slowly one at a time like automated call imput menu choices,etc, cuz password on this was the worst small keys of floating Google board, cuz kept getting it wrong & locked out 10 secs and affraid would be way more to total lock out & I can't afford to pay to fix that & also lost lots of money of stimlus etc so like it has many quircks & screen unresponsive online even my bank, etc and so is not the aps but the cell. A terrible one just, cuz of that. ik it'd be. you get what you pay for, I suppose. Yeah so there is that & frustrating. Idk if it's, cuz I dropped it by my bed or what. I doubt it, but according to Google this occurs anyhow.  I have never had something like this or this bad on Android. Hardest cell to figure out. I wish it had been a stylus. I am used to faster easier normal set up but the apps etc on this drop menuu cool yet odd too. I need a flag uppper tier best unlocked not this. Ugh. Well its best loking cheap cell out in the market though. I think or imho. thats about it. they need to do better."

1558,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"The good news is this unit has not been used, so it is new old stock for 20% of new price. Bought mostly for the camera, 1/3rd the price of another Nikon. I bought the blue version, I guess that color did not sell well. It took 3 software upgrades, meaning it has been in the box since day one. I'm surprised at how clunky some of the tools are. Face recognition only works in bright light, so that's out. The phone kept telling me I'm not me, thanks loads. Hard to find the pages to change settings. No earphone jack, I had to buy some of the plug-in type. Does not sense when I am looking at it. Only 2 keyboard options, nothing for anyone with poor vision. No option for screenshots. My older much cheaper android phone by a dif maker has a LOT more ease of use features, odd. Samsung and T Mobile keep trying to install ""exciting"" games and emojis for 13 year old girls. I guess they are the primary demographic for their phones.  I wish the back is not glass, because they shatter easily. I understand why they do this, improved signal reception. The phone asked me to install facebook, when I said no it cut off the FB messenger feature. Ergo compulsory buy in on FB. I have a Samsung Gear 360 camera, I could download the app into the phone but it does not work. So good camera, poor software design, All of the basic important things work well."
1559,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"The phone was unlocked but was a little surprised that T-Mobile branding came up.  This seems to be normal behavior since the phone I got for my wife initially came up as Verison, but restarted with T-Mobile branding matching our service.  We are getting updates through T-Mobile and should get Android 13 as soon as T-Mobile has tested it - according to their website.The condition of the phone was excellent and looked in new condition.  The screen is beautiful with good color and resolution.  The battery life is 2 days.  It still supports MicroSD to expand the internal storage so made good use of that.Did the Samsung transfer app to move everything from my old phone to this one.  It worked great but still needed to setup accounts other than Google and Microsoft.  Did spend some time storing away the Samsung apps and replacing with Google apps e.g., calendar, Gmail, Contacts, etc.The camera takes great pictures using the Samsung Camera App.  It was a little unexpected that 4K60 was being stored on internal storage instead of the Samsung U3 MicroSD that works fine in the Panasonic G9 at 4K60.  Nevertheless, the JPEG pictures and AVC videos look great.  Will try out the Pro mode over time.Android Auto works much better than my old phone.  No connection problems.Very happy with the purchase."
1560,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"When I first got this phone I had a problem.  There was software on it that prevented a lot of the functions from working.  I contacted the seller and received a very prompt and very professional response.  They immediately offered to replace for refund the phone, whichever I preferred.  Before I returned it, I decided to factory reset it to remove any information I had managed to add.  Once that was done, the problem software was gone!!!  Phone works perfectly and is in better condition than the seller stated!  I can't say enough about the professionalism of their customer service!  All sellers should conduct business this way; but few do!  I will happily refer this seller to friends or family and I will use them without hesitation for my future needs!"
1561,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,This is my 2nd S20+ on Amazon renewed first one was a bust from another seller. Phone did not do software updates like this one on Verizon network also phone did not ever switch over from 4g to 5g even one time like this one. I am so happy this one did 4 software updates immediately to the latest software. It came fully unlocked and even shows Verizon start up theme. So happy with it! Exactly what I was looking for. Buy from this seller. I did my homework and he is great!!
1562,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,First Samsung. But many many other Android phones.  I bought refurbished and it seemed almost new to me and there were zero noticeable defects or scratches. TY Seller and props!The UI takes some getting  used to. Only minus is the fingerprint reader. Takes a while to work with it and slower than non in screen ones I've used.Also bootloader for US version is a pain to unlock. This would be my first Andrlid phone I have not had the BL unlocked. Boo Samsung.WIN 10/11 have fantastic integration w this phone as well as Dex option.Sunmsung's reputation for a quality product was met

This phone can handle all that you can throw at it. If you need everything you will be so happy to buy this phone. The color choice is so pretty soft color perfect for any woman as a gift. The only thing is there is not booklet of how to us it you have to get an e-booklet Have fun with this phone"

Had my concerns about buying a renewed phone validated. Disappointed and a few hundred dollars down now and looking for another phone.Updated! I did call the company that refurbished. There is a 1 year warranty. Miracle happening the phone started working again after 8 hours of reboots. No issues anymore. Weird, still documented with company.Phone is fully functional once again"
1565,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,There's not a scratch or blemish on this phone. It arrived in nice packaging with aftermarket accessories. Connecting to my carrier was a breeze and the phone is working very well. I'm so impressed with the condition that I went ahead and ordered my mom a replacement phone as well.
1566,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,There was nothing I disliked.l bought it for my grandson as a gift he loves it he was telling me about all the things he can do with it. Thanks that made my day ğŸ˜Š
1567,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Great product, but needs to be looked over before shipped out, the back of it had come unglued and could be pried up with fingernail. Had to set a heavy book on it for over 24 hours to get the back to stay on."
1568,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I like the S20+ that I have had for 3 years without a problem or needing a battery that I bought a 2nd one from this great seller. Phone is just like new.  I highly recommend this phone and seller. Phone arrived immediately.
1569,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I had bought another S20 but that would  Heat up during the charging..but so far this okay less see how it gos
1570,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"El producto para ser renovado es muy bueno, realmente parece nuevo. No hubo problemas en el envio, el unico problema fue con el cargador enviado que no estaba funcionando bien del todo."
1571,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Honestly such a good buy, shipping was a week early. Phone works perfectly, no scratches, no glitches and came unlocked for my straight talk sim card. Only problems it had was some scuffing at the top of the phone which does not alter or interfere with the screen in anyway, a small blemish im willing to live with for the $500 discount on this phone"
1572,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Great for a refurbished product honestly. However, the screen is minimal light burnt somehow from a background i cannot identify. You have to pay really close attention to the top and bottom left of the phone, the top has a clear ""For you"" and the bottom left shows a faint home symbol. Only reason i give 4/5 stars on the phone itself. Otherwise, Id highly recommend:)"
1573,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Like: Good equipment.Dislike: No headphones, after I labelled the 9H tempered protective sticker on the screen, l can't use fingerprint recognition."
1574,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Like the assistance to approaching end results
1575,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I haven't used the facial recognition or fingerprint reader. My prior phone was a Samsung Note 8 that couldn't get latest android version for year or two and I chose this one for the DOF camera feature. Display is excellent and battery life is amazing.It is faster on all tasks than the Note 8 and can get 5G.When you choose wifi, 5G goes away. Not sure how that may affect me.Even though it was a refurb from Amazon, T-Mobile set me up with no questions and put in a new sim card at not cost. They transferred data and apps.It was frustrating that due to the minimal change in size it was hard to find a case for phone 2 years old. And I couldn't find a case with the kickstand that had good reviews. Ended up with an Otter from Amazon and happy though had to get the protective screens separately."
1576,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Small glitches but nothing major, just the screen input will not work for the homescreen at times. Since owning the phone it's happened twice and I'm going on a year."
1577,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Don't like the figure print security it does not read my thumb print I have to continue to do it then it ask me to wait 25sec ever time... I like the camera on the galaxy s20+ it's nice.
1578,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Good shape,  very minimal usage. Good battery,  like new"
1579,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I've had this phone for 3 weeks now and no complaints so far. The battery is a little lacking especially when I use 5g, but on lte it lasts over a day. Seller was Chubbiestech. Shipping very fast too."
1580,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Lo recibi en muy buen estado, pero cuando lo conecte al cargador no me detecta la carga rapida y cuando lo conecto del otro lado del cargador si funciona pero luego me aparece de nuevo carga norma, lo probe con otro original y tampoco me funciono la carga rapida. no se si es error del sistema o del celular, necesito ayuda"
1581,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Amazing phone!
1582,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,It worked perfectly and met my expectations
1583,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I use iPhone and needed another phone. I was not sure I should get this or not because of some reviews. But I thought I give this a try , so I ordered it. When it I arrived , it was almost brand new though the box and the charger are not original . I tried with different SIM cards from different carriers. And great! It is full unlocked both for GSM and CDMA networks . Camera is really good and it also has cool features like bixby vision and others . Well, what can I say ? I made a right choice and Iâ€™m really satisfied with my purchase."
1584,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"So far, I couldn't be happier. I could have gotten a similar deal from an Ebay seller for a bit less, but the ability to get this phone virtually overnight was the deciding factor.So far, everything looks perfect. Not a scratch to be found and the phone works as it should.If I do have a problem, I'm sure Amazon will make it right. I've never had any trouble with returns and that's reassuring."
1585,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Absolutely love this phone
1586,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Good phone
1587,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Llego como nuevo, excelente producto"
1588,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Finds a signal where my old phone couldn't
1589,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,BUEN PRODUCTO ME LLEGÃ“ BIEN
1590,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Phone looked good and works great but none of the extra things listed came with it. Only the charger and charger cable. Listing said headphones, usb connecter, screen protector and smart switch insert and pin ejector where included as well but did not come with mine. Small nick in center of the screen but the phone overall looks and works great. Just disappointed that what was listed wasn't true and it was late by a few days..."
1591,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"So I had purchased the same model from another seller and had nothing but issues with it from the start. I had to return it within the 90 day return period. I purchased this one to replace the other one prior to returning the other one and was able to transfer all my info from my other phone to this phone. This phone has been much much better! It's not perfect and sometimes the sound quality is good and then it's almost as if one of the speakers cuts out and I can only hear out of the other speaker and then it'll kick back on again. Could just be a loose wire or something within the phone, but a lot of times I listen to my phone on Bluetooth speakers anyway and it does not impact the quality of sound that way, so it's a minor issue in my opinion. The battery life is very good, the screen sensitivity is perfect. The only thing is that sometimes when my fingers are damp, the fingerprint reader does not read my fingerprint and I have to manually input my password, but again, minor issue that I'm willing to overlook for the price differential of this phone as opposed to a brand new phone. I'm happy with this purchase"
1592,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Me encantÃ³ el dispositivo
1593,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"This is a pretty good phone, but there are some flaws that I don't know if it's a Samsung thing or what, but when I have the Superfast charger plugged in it wont work right and I have to literally hold the plug in just have this feature work, I think I'm just going to hunt down a fast charger since that seems to work a lot better, however this phone works pretty fast and great on T-Mobile, it was originally an AT&T phone, but as soon as I put in my SIM card everything switched over to T-Mobile settings which was great"
1594,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I use this phone everyday for my work and personal and is a goo
1595,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"seems to be of good quality, like previous spigen cases I've had. However, the fit is significantly looser than past covers i've had. This one slips off the phone with very minor effort, where others have taken significant force to peel off. It's so easy to come off that it worries me it will come off on the first bounce of a drop.I wish edges came up further past the phone glass. The corners come up just far enough that they will keep the glass off when laying on smooth, flat surfaces, but anything with texture will still likely contact the glass."
1596,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"He just received it, not sure how everything is working.  Seems like it is doing great."
1597,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"The description claims that it has ""Screen: no scratches."" but the screen is covered in scratches.It will work and I'm not wanting to go through the hassle of returning it but it was very disappointing to have paid the extra money for no scratches on the screen and still get the screen covered in scratches."
1598,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Phone arrived early, in like new condition everything works great takes beautiful photos. Seller O & M Wireless stands behind there product would recommend them."
1599,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,El cargador que enviaron no era bueno
1600,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Great Phone.  Said it was fully unlocked, but receive phone still controlled by Verizon.  LONG process with Verizon to get them to unlock.  Please don't say FULLY UNLOCKED when it's NOT."
1601,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I was excited for this but very disappointed by the phone I received.  I guess that we have very different ideas of what ""Excellent Condition"" would mean.  The phone I received had a bent frame and the screen did not sit well against it.  I could easily pinch the phone and move the screen closer to the frame, but it would pop back away when I let go.  Dust and moisture would migrate into this crack over time and work the screen further away from the frame every day.  This screen would probably shatter the first time it was dropped.  It was not solid at all.  The loose screen might even catch on something each time I put it into my pocket.  I did not even bother to turn it on.  I would have classified this phone as ""Defective, but probably serviceable"".  It was clean and probably worked, but it was not solid at all and not ""excellent"""
1602,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Phone ok but battery drain out so fast, price in prime day higher than regular day. I returned it 3 weeks ago and Amazon did not refund back to me"
1603,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Phone works great. Battery life is way less than expected, drains pretty quick. Other than that, no complaints."
1604,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I missed my Samsung so much! Arrived 2 days earlier than what was estimated. ğŸ‘ No scratches or damages and works perfectly.
1605,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Awesome devise works reat and delivered fast
1606,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Subpar battery life and camera. I cannot speak on the call quality since my Sim had not arrived yet but so far I'm not too impressed. Hoping I can play around with it and learn to enjoy the phone.
1607,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I don't like changing to a new phone.  My old one quit charging.  This one has transferred easily,  works similarly,  and keeps me connected."
1608,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,"I was very surprised when I received this phone. It honestly looked new. I carefully examined it and there were no marked on the sides or back and even the screen had no scratches even the little tiny micro scratches phones develop in normal use. Also battery life is amazing, so I am honestly thinking this was a new phone.Now on to the specs, I purchased this phone in 2022. It is still very fast. It does not have 5g but I have not seen any issues yet. I did some reading and found new iPhones use LTE most of the time to save battery life but leave it listed as 5g on the screen.Lastly I do miss MagSafe, but am glad it does have wireless charging. The cameras still take very good pictures. For less than half the cost of a new iPhone you honestly canâ€™t go wrong"
1609,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,"I purchased this phone in early 2021. Itâ€™s been almost two years & I'm still impressed with this phone. This was an incredible value & an amazing upgrade. It hasnâ€™t shown any signs of slowing down. A full charge still lasts me all day. The camera quality is excellent & takes crisp videos.The only reason Iâ€™m giving it 4 stars is the audio. My wife also has an 11 Pro Max that we bought direct from Apple & when playing videos, the audio comes out of the speaker at the bottom & the speaker at the earpiece. Mine only comes out the bottom & itâ€™s much quieter than hers. It works fine for phone calls, but doesnâ€™t kick in when playing videos.Still, for the price I paid, Iâ€™m very happy with this phone."
1610,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,"Quick Note: The test report screenshot shows three failed items. That's only due to me not having headphones to test at the time as well as the SIM card. I've a screenshot of speed test working on T-Mobile network LTE. So it works fine.Initially I ordered an iPhone 11 Pro Max for my mother, 64GB version. Unfortunately, the ear piece wasn't working and contacted the seller via Amazon message center. I had to send the phone back in order to complete the replacement.They provided the  2-day shipping label (sent out on Saturday, arrived there Monday). They kept in pretty close contact with me and that was good. They shipped Tuesday and received Thursday morning. So there's very little delay in getting the replacement.Diagnostics checked out (see screenshots). The Earpiece tests that failed were due to me not having a headphone to try it on at the time. But I'm assuming it works and will edit if that changes.The condition of the phone is near new! No blemishes on the body and screen looks really clean. There was very minute permanent lines in the screen that looked like smudges, but they with the sceen on, you don't notice it at all. PLUS they gave us a couple acrylic screen protectors, so that was a major plus!The BONUS (at least for me)!It turned out to be a blessing in disguise for me, because they ended up upgrading me to the 256GB model free (initially 64GB model). My mom didn't understand what that meant, and I pretty much explained that she can download apps and take photos to her hearts desire LOL.It's a phone for mom, and she's coming from a Samsung A21 phone that had performance issues and wifi problems. Kept saying there's no internet and reboots in safemode. I wanted simplicity with Face-ID (which also works) that pretty much takes care of itself, and iOS delivers on that.So ya, experienced issues. All devices will have a defect one way or the other (or none). You just need to contact their support and work with them before submitting your review. It annoys me when someone says ""It's defective"" with no resolution comments of what they ended up doing.If I need another replacement phone, I'll definitely do business with them again."
1611,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,"I received the iPhone in an acceptable condition, there was a few scratches and for some reason the screen touch felt heavy that's why I returned."
1612,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,"El telÃ©fono ğŸ“± tiene buena apariencia, un rayon en pantalla  que lo cubre un protector, llegÃ³ con 84% de baterÃ­a ğŸª« que se agota muy rÃ¡pido no le dura mucho lo estoy probando, tenia mucha duda sobre comprar un telÃ©fono re acondicionado, la estÃ©tica bien la pila ğŸ”‹ NO!!"
1613,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,"Besides the one I got having only 82% battery capacity, this is a really good phone for a nice price."
1614,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,I got a really good looking phone Iâ€™ve got the gold 256 GB and itâ€™s really a upgrade from my old Samsung battery health did come at 85%. I guess thatâ€™s decent right other than that itâ€™s a really great phone.
1615,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,"I was having a real problem (to me) with the ""Zoom"" feature.  I must have been unknowingly touching the screen with three fingers, thus enlarging the font too much for the screen size.  After de-selecting that ""Zoom"" feature, I became happy again with the purchase."
1616,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,"I really enjoyed battery life,facial recognition is something new for me enjoying my iPhone very much"
1617,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,"Okay Reviewers I ordered this IPhone 11 Pro Max off of my sons prime account.. This is one bad ass phone! And I got a great deal from this amazing company! Shipping was on point! And this phone OMG perfect! Like it came from Apple! If I didnâ€™t know it was refurbished? I would have thought it was never touched! Thatâ€™s how perfect it is! I felt like a child at Christmas! Stoked! So, definitely would and will buy from this company again! Thank you for your loyalty to your customers! Super excited! Placed it in a case as soon as I looked at it .Okay about the iPhone 11 Pro Max .. outside of itâ€™s beauty . Wish I could take a picture of it , but i canâ€™t . Iâ€™m on it..the 11 is holding its value for great reasons .. it really is a bad ass phone !! And the 12â€™s are nice but the 11â€™s sit right next to those 12â€™s ! But cheaper in price but the quality is all the same!The pictures are amazing!!! ( FYI My son has the 12 My sister 12 pro and brother in law has 12 pro Max ) so pictures are not so noticeably different.. cause this 11 pro Max takes great photos also and the battery life is awesome ! 24 hrs no charge and still had life left! I have charged it with the cord charging ( it came with a good charging cord not junk) and I also have charged it with the magnetic cordless charging.. about the same.I have not done the face recognition as of yet.. I use a passcode.. I do miss the finger / thumb recognition button but from what I see with my son ? Face recognition is prob just as fast or faster?The speakers on this is loud! Love it!Now yes this is a bigger device it is a 6.5 in screen but itâ€™s not bulky at all ! The phone is slender not heavy but a case did help tremendously holding it cause itâ€™s so thin.. haha i dont know how to explain that one but I Dont know to drop it haha so a case helps to grip it .. if that makes sense ? LolBut with the cheaper price tag ? I was able to get the highest GB and still save a few hundredâ€™ dollars!I did my research cause I was looking at this phone for a while and then was gearing for the 12 pro Max for it has 3 or 4 better features. But After comparing and deep research? What was being said is true! The 11â€™s are amazing phones! And unless your a Photographer? You wonâ€™t see a inkling of a difference with the camera or video.. the processor in the 11â€™s are also fast and made right! Apple surly did a great job with the 11â€™s !!! So again for what you get and with that price tag ? You canâ€™t go wrong with the Iphome 11 pro Max!  Iâ€™m freaking happy I got one heck of a deal ! I love the look ,the quality, how fast it responds, the pictures, the battery life, the features, and the company that I bought it from! Hope this helps with someoneâ€™s research and decision making!"
1618,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,Good but worth the price !No issues !Just need a good charger
1619,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,Excelente servicio y telÃ©fonos en lo personal tuve un pequeÃ±o inconveniente pero inmediatamente me dieron soluciÃ³n 100% recomendado entre mi familia y amigos
1620,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,Great customer service!!! First phone the volume was low and they returned with no problems. Second phone is perfect!! Will definitely do business again!! Thanks
1621,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,Worked great for 3 days and then started messing up. I returned for a refund and itâ€™s been NOTHING but problems trying to get my money back. Iâ€™ve gotten the run around told several different storyâ€™s! I was told I would have my refund back by the 27th here is it the 29th and still havenâ€™t seen the refund. When I try to find out about it all I get is rude agents that are hateful as all get out with no information. There is no problem giving your money but sure is hard to get it back! Itâ€™s a hit or miss better off saving for a new one! Itâ€™s very aggravating and a headache itâ€™s not $20 or something itâ€™s almost $600. They tell you 2 weeks for your refund but when the 2 weeks come they turn around and say longer than 2 weeks. If you do purchase good luck hopefully youâ€™re experience is better!I was kinda nervous to buy this as the last phone I got (FROM ANOTHER SELLER) I had problems from the beginning even the 2nd phone they had sent me. But this by far is an amazing purchase! If I didnâ€™t know it was â€œrenewedâ€ Iâ€™d swear it was brand new off the shelf! Also came with 100% battery life! Got it yesterday at 8:00am and itâ€™s now 4:23pm the next day and itâ€™s still yet to go dead Iâ€™ve not even had to charge it. It did come completely dead but thatâ€™s not a big deal I guess. Iâ€™ve used it a lot so battery is by far AMAZING! Thatâ€™s a big plus for me the speakers are amazing and very loud. If ever needed I will definitely come back to this seller with no hesitation at all! Iâ€™m just very pleased with everything over all!
1622,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,Very happy with this purchase. Paid for 256 memory. Received phone with 512 memory. I feel I got a fantastic deal.

1626,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,"Phone is in great shape, the only reason for the 4 star is there is nothing on the phone or the packaging with the IMEI number. Made it more difficult to get the device activated because you had to get it hooked up to itunes prior to activating the services with my carrier."
1627,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,"Came with everything a new phone comes with, I had absolutely NO PROBLEM placing my SIM card in it and downloading my other iPhone profile and works perfectly !!!"

1631,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,"I want to recommend that you choose Sikksound to purchase from! I just ordered the iPhone 11 Pro Max silver Friday, received it the following Monday. When I received the package I was kind of nervous because the packaging was so small, but they had everything packed nice and tidy! I had no problems with my SIM card, it worked immediately, I had a little issue with my Apple ID but I figured it out, nothing to do with the seller. The phone didnâ€™t have a single scratch, it literally looks brand new, LITERALLY! Face ID, touch screen, camera, speaker, everything works! Batter life is at 97%, which is more then I expected! If I ever need to purchase a phone again, I will be purchasing from them! Thank you! ğŸ˜Š"

1635,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,I have this 4 stars because although the phone was on very good condition. When unboxing it comes with a very sticky protective sheet on top of the screen. Upon removing the sheet unlike appleLeaves a sticky film covering the entire screen. Water or little soap alone was not able to remove this film.My husband had to use an adhesive remover a few time to completely remove the film.

1645,Apple,IPhone 11 Pro Max,256 GB,IOS,6.5 Inches,"I'm so happy! At first I was skeptical, because I read some negative reviews! I ended up buying the iphone 11 pro max silver 64gb unlocked  and I received what i ordered!! I had an iphone 7 plus, and I bought this with my own money. I'm so happy.

Today I use the phone to navigate for miles. I did about a half an hour of surfing the web and the battery went from 100% to 43% just like that. Huge bummer. Hope it lasts till Christmas.I was looking for an inexpensive phone for myself and then another one to purchase for my mother. After being unsuccessful with another slightly more expensive phone that did not operate properly I came upon the reviews for this phone and decided to give it a shot.I would say so far mostly good. Right out of the box the talk to text works much more smoothly than Samsung a53. There's a lot more on the keyboard for this phone so I find myself getting a little lost trying to figure out how to get the keyboard to come back etc but generally it's been easier to operate and I appreciate that the microphone and the keyboard can be displayed simultaneously.The fingerprint reader is fairly worthless, almost never works but I have a very sturdy case it can making it tricky to jam your finger in there. Seems like maybe not the best idea to have it where it is and then you end up limited to only using your right hand so not so great for lefties like me.Battery life is okay. I'm satisfied with that. It seems to go down to 80% pretty quick but that range in between 80% and it's when it's below 50 seems like it takes a little longer. I had hoped it would be better and it seemed to be better the first few weeks but capacity may have gone done significnatly in a short time. Also noticed that the charging cable and block charges slowly but if I put on my old pixel changer it is rapid charging, not sure why it wouldn't be the other way around.As another reviewer mentioned, on the Verizon network you might have a little trouble receiving texts. I did it first, I didn't do anything to change it except for one of the updates that I was prompted to do and then suddenly they came in. I'll keep an eye on that. I'm going to try and update as I discover more about this phone. I will say in general getting around on this phone is a little trickier than my old pixel XL. Like trying to go back seems to only happen with a swipe to the right. Trying to toggle between different apps was also tricky. What I figured out was that you have to go into settings, navigation and then turn off gestures to get the three buttons at the bottom for back, reduce app, and then to show all open apps..Also trying to get my apps that I do not have icons on the screen for yet is a little tricky... Seems like if you start swiping from 3/4 down the screen and up you will get them which is too similar to swiping from all the way at the bottom of the screen which does something totally different. Trying to get the app icons onto the home screen into a shared bubble is almost like a video game. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.Update- this was fixed with system update: Something that's starting to happen that's concerning me is that I'm realizing it's rebooting and updating software nightly. Tonight it did it twice and wakes me up at 1:00 a.m. and then again it almost two with ""hello Moto""after it's done updating. I don't know why it needs such frequent updates and I'm beginning to think it's a bit of a glitch. This would be the second phone that I had from Amazon in a row that seems glitchy so I'm not sure if these phones are new or used and refurbished. Hopefully these are all about some setting I need to figure out how to adjust."
1659,Motorola,Moto G stylus | 2021| Locked | Made for US by Motorola | 4/128GB | 48MP Camera | White,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I just needed to upgrade my phone. I used to have a moto g7 plus and it was starting to freeze, glitch, and was lacking storage space. I deleted hundreds of media files, pictures, apps, and backed up downloads, but no matter my efforts, my phone was still low on storage. It also said that my phone was susceptible to viruses (like every piece of technology is) so I downloaded an anti-virus software, a VPN, and a number of other apps that had reviews promising to fix the problem, but it didn't do anything for me. An upgrade was my last option.This newer moto is so much better! It includes a stylus, a better camera, more storage space, and it accepts the sim card from my previous moto so it was a steal. I'm still waiting on the case, but I got the camera and screen protector and they work like a charm. Everything was included and I was able to transfer all of my apps, backgrounds, and backed up photos and contacts from my last phone without any trouble. I still have to sign into everything and remember passwords, but luckily I found a notepad app that backed up all my passwords to the cloud so that isn't a problem either.I'm still waiting to see if the 2 day battery holds up. So far from what I've seen, the battery drains pretty fast. It goes down about 2% every 5 minutes. I haven't charged the phone since I unpackaged it, but the rate that the battery is draining isn't very promising.Despite that one minor setback, the phone is great and has worked perfectly for everything else. It's so much more refreshing to have a phone that will take pictures without glitching and deleting them or can open websites without completely exiting google and sending me to my home screen.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. I hope this phone has a couple of years in it so I don't have to upgrade again any time soon.Edit: the phone goes through a software update every single night and I have to restart it every single morning. I thought I would wait to see if it only updated because of all the new sign ins and media I had to add, but it hasn't stopped. I'm not too unhappy because updates aren't bad, it's just getting frustrating having to constantly restart the phone and wait for the update to finish before I can use my phone for the day. Which also means some of my alarms get delayed and it's mildly inconvenient."

Click on an icon or a website and you're there NOW! Has all of the motion features I like: chop to turn the flashlight, twist wrist to access the camera, etc. Especially good is the wireless app and data transfer feature. Moto learned a lesson from the iphones. All my data and most of my apps were transferred over from my old phone, except a couple. Like most Motos it is feature rich. The stylus is ok, but more of a gimmick to me than really useful, but others may like it. The fingerprint feature is great!Dislikes; the battery started out as long lasting (about 2 days) but now it's less than 24 hours. Granted, it may be that I spent a LOT of time tweaking it to my liking, and I DO spend a lot of time on it, but still, I had to recharge it after only 18 hours use this morning. Pretty bad for a phone that touted a 2 day battery. Also, the phone automatically downloaded a plethora of security and OS updates. It now runs on Android 11. That took a couple of days for Cricket and Moto update their systems. Geez!I'm not going to return it. Even with the dismal battery life, it's still better than my Samsung A02S. It remains to be seen if the battery life improves after all of the setup activity is done"

No one could say how many phone manufacturers do such a thing, but I know that moto phones do get slow and glitch out after about a year of use, like clockwork. New, old, it doesn't matter. A year after activation they just struggle, almost like they want you to buy a new phone.Knowing that your moto phone will only last about a year, at least you hope for good while it's new. This phone is adequate in every way, except the battery. In no way, is this a 2 day battery. Even with light use, there's no way to get 2 days out of this phone. I don't believe you could get 16 hours out of this phone at total rest. Keep a charger nearby, and a power bank. Other than that, it's okay... For now."

Only gripe is that it is huge phone, but I knew that going in.  It is like buying a big truck to go offroading and complaining about how much room it takes in your garage.  It is a serious phone that is fast and reliable. The sound quality is very good. The speakers are very loud.  The picture quality is good enough. Battery is good."

I have both phones and like them very much. You should strongly consider this phone if you don't need NFC, 5G, and AMOLED, and high price tag.Now there is catch. Apparently Verizon is moving away from 3G. When it's 3G network will be shutdown completely is still to be determined by the company. Somehow, Motorola also decided to remove the 3G CDMA radio from the new Moto G Stylus 2021 phone. As such, you may not be able to receive text messages if you are on the Verizon network. The solution is simply to call Verizon to add ""CDMA-less"" feature to your line. Once that is done, everything will be using LTE afterwards.The chat feature in the Messages app can also affect the phone to receive incoming messages from the users also have the chat feature enabled on their phones. Make sure the chat feature is successfully connected if you have it enabled in your new phone. The Messages' chat feature is a Google thing and is similar to Apple's iMessage.Also if you're going to use the same SIM card from your previous phone, make sure to disable the chat feature before you remove the SIM card from your previous phone. Without doing so will cause the chat feature to fail to connect in your new phone. According to the chat feature FAQ, it may take up to 8 days before the system to disassociate the chat feature from your previous phone. Luckily there is a portal (check the FAQ) you can go to force the chat feature to be disassociated from your previous phone. But it will still take some time (an hour or two) for the chat feature on your new phone to be successfully connected."

My last phone battery would almost twice as long as this one. The pen was ok but wasn't as great as I thought it was. Nice screen size and we'll made.

1672,Motorola,Moto G stylus | 2021| Locked | Made for US by Motorola | 4/128GB | 48MP Camera | White,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"Really good value.  Stylus isn't just for doodling either.  It's nice to have for web browsing if you have fat fingers because you can easily tap the right link the first time every time.Of course, as ""value oriented"" offering, this phone doesn't quite have it all.  For instance it lacks wireless charging and NFC.  While it has a good-sized battery and USB-C charging, lack of the latest fast charging protocols means it won't fill that battery as quickly as many others.  And while I know the Snapdragon 678 processor is generally fine, it only has 4GB of RAM behind it, so if you're a power user, some of your apps and tabs will die in the background and have to reload.  And depending on what you do and how often you backup, 128 GB might be limiting, or it might be fine.Overall, the two biggest ""sore thumb"" sticking points that non-nerds should consider about this phone are the lack of wireless charging (you can still plug in, but if you're used to it, it's a step backwards), and especially the lack of NFC, which is not a new protocol and is needed for apps that do things like opening hotel doors and other electronic locks, and for contactless pay by phone schemes like Google Pay.  For many, especially if you work a job that makes use of NFC locks and tags, no NFC might be the deal-breaker.If you can overlook those two (glaring in 2021) omissions, and don't need 5G yet (and you probably don't for a few more years), this the 2021 Moto G Stylus is a powerhouse at its price point."

But it's surviving solely based on the name and the idea behind it.Well, Motorola is worse than this.There was a time in which Motorola ruled the cell phone world.  I lived through all that.  Today, it's surviving just like the Globetrotters based solely on their namesake.  They are way behind in the cell phone world and will never catch up.Comparatively, the difference is, the Globetrotters are amazing and have amazing skills to show for it.Folks, the feeling of the phone is cheap plastic and that's what it's made out of.  Garbage camera front and back, the slowest processor that elderly people in walkers can move quicker than it's processor, it lags as much as my ex girlfriend on a treadmill, the charging speed takes nearly 3 hours to complete, and when you put on a case, you can't even move a Youtube video back to the beginning because the bezels are in the way.  The speakers are distorted and buzzing with static, and since the phone is not 5G and running on tech outdated in what seems to be 1986, I've said enough.There's a reason why the phone was $199.  It ain't for the quality folks.I'm not disuading anyone to buy Motorola, I am giving you my point of view based upon lived experience and not rumor or assumption, but I hope the company continues to thrive and hell, I hope it regains it's dominance in the cell phone market, but honestly, it's not my cup of tea and I will never own one again."

Now, I am not 100% certain that the issues lie with the Motorola Moto g stylus phone itself or if it is my issue adapting to an Android. But this has been the most frustrating phone I have ever used. Everything seems more difficult to get to, harder to find, more steps, and all around more difficult to understand the functioning of. I hope that things get easier with time. I have been using this for a few months now but I'm not seeing a whole lot of progress in the ease of my use. I may have to switch back to iPhone despite its ridiculous prices and the speed in which it starts to misbehave. iPhones are just easier to use all the way around.

The fingerprint sensor on the power button is very sensitive. I'm hoping it will stay that way. I think having it on the power button is better than having it on the back because I'm not constantly touching it. The battery life is not the full 2 days that the listing claims it is. I've been using it for about 2.5 hours and it's already at 65% (watching videos, reading, messaging). Set-up was easy, transferring my sim card to this phone was hassle free. I like that it comes with the pin you use to open the slot for the sim card. The stylus is fun to play with. It writes well, I haven't had any trouble with it. I think this is a great cell phone, especially for the price. However, I fell for the ""2 day battery life"" part and it's not entirely accurate. It is a quick charge though."

I have purchased over twenty smartphones from the Motorola Line-up and with each new iteration I find they compete nicely with the ""overpriced"" trendy smartphones at a fraction of the cost. The stylishness, fit and finish give the phone a classic modern look and feel of their more expensive competitors. Motorola's customer service is second to none as I incurred an issue with one of the products that I purchased ""used"" but it was still in warranty. I was able to converse live with a technical support person and they sent me a brand new replacement no questions asked.

The phone can detect the stylus, and reminds you if the stylus is missing.It is large, very decent display.  Speaker not so great, but usable."
1686,Motorola,Moto G stylus | 2021| Locked | Made for US by Motorola | 4/128GB | 48MP Camera | White,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"This phone is literally priced way under what it could be sold at. Screen is large and bright, offers fast refresh, and has a good image display. The battery makes it a full day even with heavy usage. Charging could be quicker but it's still way faster than the 3 year old iPhone I upgraded from. There are some attractive cases available here on Amazon as well to add better protection at reasonable prices. Features such as minimal bloatware, large memory and storage capacity, and an actual stylus make this purchase a no brainer. Would buy again"
1687,Motorola,Moto G stylus | 2021| Locked | Made for US by Motorola | 4/128GB | 48MP Camera | White,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I've had this phone for a few days now and absolutely love it. Here are my biggest impressions:1. Battery life - incredible! I'm not a heavy streamer/video user, but with what I'd consider moderate daily usage, I get 2-3days on a single charge. The fast-charging also recharges the battery much faster than my previous Android device.2. Camera - among the best you'll find on mobile phones. The 48MP camera really shines through in daylight. I've gotten so many compliments with friends and family asking about what camera I used to take photos I've sent them from this phone. The night light function is honestly incredible.3. Calls/reception - I activated this phone on Metro with 0 problems. Call quality is excellent to say the least.Could be better:1. Camera Zoom - with so many Megapixels, I was kind of surprised to find that pictures taken from a distance with full zoom still show pixelation/blurriness that you see in lower-end camera phones. Don't get me wrong; in most cases, the camera is phenomenal, but it's not perfect.2. Fingerprint reader - It's not awful, but it's not as fast as I would like it to be. But again it is NOT slow.Buy this phone, you will not regret it at all."
1688,Motorola,Moto G stylus | 2021| Locked | Made for US by Motorola | 4/128GB | 48MP Camera | White,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,This was the easiest and fastest phone I've ever set up. Put my SIMS card in and within minutes all my stuff was on the phone. Love the camera and it holds a charge forever!! That was an issue for me with other phones. Great deal. I would get a case and screen shield. I highly recommend this phone.
1689,Motorola,Moto G stylus | 2021| Locked | Made for US by Motorola | 4/128GB | 48MP Camera | White,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,I've always had LG phones in the past and am addicted to my stylus. Apparently LG stopped making phones so when I saw this at this price with 128 gigs I went for it. It's everything I hoped it would be and added bonus I got 6 month no interest payment plan with my Amazon rewards card.

I had to return it although I was very impressed with the rest of the phone.The current one works great and I will not upgrade to Android 11 unless Motorola confirms compatibility with WhatsApp.The phone has a large screen, performs very well, resolution of screen and cameras is ok but not exceptional. The battery is descent and the sound and voice qualities are fine.The stylus feature is limited but useful for my application (quick engineering sketches)I had been using a number of Motorola phones through the years and I find them in general to be of excellent value. I highly recommend this phone!"

It seems to be very sensitive. Swipe feature goes back a page when I'm really trying to go down the page and sometimes when my hand is over the screen it goes back a page even though I haven't yet touched it. I also find that the notifications stay on too long I can't see under them and it interrupts what I'm doing. I am going over the settings and can't find anything to change how long a notification stays on your screen other than that I am quite pleased with this phone quality and coloring it's really pretty good . Takes good pictures. And I love having the SD card

1695,Motorola,Moto G stylus | 2021| Locked | Made for US by Motorola | 4/128GB | 48MP Camera | White,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"For a ~300 dollar phone, I am very pleased with the performance. Screen is pretty decent, processor seems decent, RAM is adequate. Camera is... alright.Obviously this can't compete with a phone that's close to a grand in price, but it does perform very well for the price point.This is now my second Motorola phone and I see myself going for a 3rd after this. The special sauce they bring to the table is better than Samsung in my opinion. The moto gestures are just sooooooo convenient I can't see myself living without em on something else.I use this on the Boost Mobile phone plan and network, Boost does not officially offer this phone but that's why you buy em unlocked and then activate."

Â I would start with the salient features -1.  Best phone with a Stylus in Budget.2.  Screen size Super Size3.  Fingerprint reader too good and fast.4.  Battery life excellent.  Even though I use the Phone for basic use like Calls and Emails, the Battery life is good enough and I usually charge it every other day.5.  Best Android Phone in the below $300 price that too with a Stylus.6.  Ofcourse the Stylus Pen is little thin but does all the functions as in the case of Competitors who are selling Stylus phones for 4 times the Price of this Moto G Stylus 2021.7.  I am writing this review after thoroughly using the Phone for a Month and really happy with its performance so far."

It's way bigger than I imagined, but it's great for playing games and watching videos. Motorola has hit a home run with this phone. It's priced like a budget phone but with massive storage, camera and screen it rivals many phones 2-3x it's price. I highly recommend the 128gb model."

It's very big yet relatively easy to hold. The resolution is beautiful and the features they've added are awesome. I like that there are different motions to shake the phone to access the flashlight, camera and other features. It does offer biometric security features. They no longer use the home button, back button, and applications button which is a feature I have always liked which is why I went with 4 stars instead of 5. You can still do all of those features but it is going to take getting used to for me. Other than changing the way l to access those features the phone is great so far"

So yeah I can't give this phone a 5 star rating because I would like to use it for at least 3 years. Smartphones are switched 1-2 years intervals, and you provably will not need to switch the battery after that long. So consider this a 5 star rating as long as you do not need a battery change after 2 years and do not mind having a low end phone. (Low end phone means you cannot use PokÃ©mon go at release)"

Coming from samsung android, I didn't appreciate the 50 google apps, 47 of which cannot be uninstalled, and I'm specifically looking for a phone that will not use chrome. If I had known, I would not have purchased. If anyone else cares about this, I hope this information helps them.

1708,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"The device I received looks and could pass for new. Battery health shows 88 percent. Works flawlessly, and no problem updating to iOS 16.1.1. Why people continue to get conned into signing 2 and 3 year agreements to finance a phone is beyond me. Having an UNLOCKED phone like this iPhone X is a great way to afford much better deals from MVNOs like Mint, Visible, etc without being handcuffed to a carrier for years and the freedom to port out if service degrades or they start playing games with the bill.The X is still supported by Apple, is the right size, and plenty of speed for what most people do with a phone. I bought the 256GB model for $250. You really can't go wrong with that. A high quality 20 watt charger and LONG (much longer than what came with the phone) Lightning cable was also included.Phones like this have plenty of life left in them and keep us free from the scams that carrier financing are without draining our bank accounts. It's also nice to not have all the carrier bloatware shoved down your throat (more a problem with Android than iOS)."
1709,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,Iâ€™m not one of those that has to have the newest latest version phone so this was a welcome purchase and the condition was excellent the only problem Iâ€™ve had so far is the battery seems to run down faster than expected this could be me or Like a lot of people the previous owner may have kept the phone on charge every chance they got from what I understand this is not a good idea it shortens the life of a battery they recommend not charging until the phone goes below 40% Because with batteries like this nowadays the battery can only be charged a certain number of times and if youâ€™re charging it when itâ€™s not needed your shortening my life of the battery
1710,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,My daughter loves her phone. The condition of the one we received is what I would consider 90% great. It had very light scuffs on the corners as if it shifted around in a case and an ever so light scratch on the back glass. The battery was the best part with its health at 95%. Sound is great and Face ID works flawlessly. Great purchase. As of writing this It was also able to update to iOS 16.1

It shipped quickly to my country though I used a forwarder to send it to my country, Angola.  The screenjust looks nice, and face ID works perfectly. The battery capacity is 82%, not a great thing but was already expecting. So, I recommed to buy from this seller."
1722,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"Bought this Sunday received it on Wednesday with prime shipping (did have to pay an extra $10). Have been using it since and it works great! Battery life is good which I wasnâ€™t expecting since it is an older phone, and I know how iPhones get once they are old. I used my SIM Card form my old phone and didnâ€™t have any issues connecting to it. Overall, Iâ€™m really satisfied with this purchase!"
1723,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,The phone works great and was easy to set up. The phone looks great minus a couple knicks around the edge which are easily hidden with a phone case. Other than that Iâ€™m very happy with my purchase.
1724,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,I upgraded to this phone and although it say refurbished it looked brand new.  I have had it a few weeks and it works great.  Just need my son to show me how to change feature and learn how to better use it.

1727,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"I could not find any defects, very impressive. Not a bad Price for something that is still totally effective, and only five years ago was super expensive."
1728,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"Great phone lasted for what i needed from it, but the screen had a dead spot on it that sent the touch screen into disarray, ended up having to completely replace the screen which caused the Face ID to stop working, I lost the ability to use the phone as a phone and had to resort to headphones to make calls or do anything with a mic related activity.Other than those two defects the phone worked well."

I ordered four phones from Amazon so far and all the chargers worked except this last purchase.Iâ€™m taking away a star for the faulty charger"
1730,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,everything is ok and work fine and updated to ios 16 . I would like to get the history for the device(example if the screen has changed or not)
1731,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"Received it in very good condition one month ago. Battery capacity showed 94% after initial setup but it dropped to 92% in a very short period after a battery calibration. A few days ago (less than 30 days usage), a message appeared on the battery app that the battery needed replacement service due to its significantly dropped performance. Went to a local Apple Store two days ago and had the battery replaced. It has worked perfectly since then. I would give a 5 star review if not for the short battery life."
1732,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,The iPhone X delivered on time. The phone looks good as new honestly. Have zero problems with it to start off. So far it feels absolutely worth the purchase

The only thing I donâ€™t like is the battery life, but itâ€™s not really a big deal because I was expecting it, itâ€™s a 4 years old used phone.I am a drone pilot, which I use for my photography business, so I needed a new cheap reliable phone. This phone works the way I expected, definitely not disappointed."

1737,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"I use the facial recognition all the time. Never fails me. The long battery life means Iâ€™m not constantly having to recharge my phone, but when I do, as long as I use an Apple charger, it only takes about an hour to be 80-85% charged. If no one told me this was a used phone when I bought it, it would be really hard to tell the difference. Greatly satisfied with this purchase."
1738,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,Phone looks like new working fine except face recognition. Canâ€™t use it to open my phone so need to enter your passwords for all my apps every time I use them.
1739,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,For the price good deal it had an issue when first opened company reached out immediately and advised to try something and it worked phone works great so far no issues now as of yet
1740,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"Great deal!! Mine arrived with no physical signs of use!! Just like an 80% battery life, but thatâ€™s fine with me, because this phone was so cheap. Totally worth the price."
1741,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"For the price itâ€™s not a bad phone. It was good for the first 2 months maybe but then the problems started rolling in. The sound quality started to lack. My alarm go off very  low, almost like as if I was on a call when they were going off and if it wasnâ€™t for me being a light sleeper I wouldâ€™ve missed them. Sometimes they donâ€™t go off at all even though theyâ€™re set correctly and all. Same for the timers. At times the keyboard clicks also sound bad and lack. Then recently, all of a sudden when Im on a call I cannot hear anything unless I put the phone on speaker, no one wants their conversation heard. Overall, with the knowledge that this phone is refurbished, itâ€™s not too bad but thereâ€™s some MAJOR problems wrong with it and itâ€™s only been a couple months"
1742,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"I really like to buy Amazon renewed products when I have the opportunity.  Not only have I saved a TON of money, but I like giving things a second life, but with the safety of being able to return it if it arrives broken or damaged.  I have purchased iPads, my HP laptop, my smart sprinkler controller and other smart phones renewed and have yet to be let down.  I was a little worried when this iPhone X arrived in some strange box that just said, ""smart phone"" and when I opened it up and saw that the cables were all generic.  I was worried it was a fake, but it was the real thing.  It wasn't quite as clean as I hoped it would be (physically) but it didn't have any real cosmetic damage, so I cleaned it up, popped in a T-Mobile SIM card, ran a software update and BOOM!  We were off and running.  It looks and works like a brand new iPhone X.  I love that I was able to upgrade from my iPhone 8 without having to pay full price for a brand new device.If you're considering trying an Amazon renewed device, I can attest to them.  So far I've had really good experiences.  I took off a star because I expected it to come in original packaging and with OEM cables etc. and for it to be clean like new, but otherwise it was perfect.I sincerely hope this review was helpful for someone else!  Feel free to ask any questions!"
1743,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,The phone seems to work fine. Only issues are the battery life. Iâ€™ll have to pay out of pocket to get it replaced but itâ€™s fine.
1744,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,Everything good except for the little three dots on the screen
1745,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"i've been using this iPhone since a couple of weeks now and i'm impressed! so far so good i every way, perfect condition no scratches at all, fully functional. The only thing is the battery life came with 77%, it's a lil bit low for the average renewed devices and if you give it a hard use with high performance apps or gaming, you will run out of battery pretty quickly. In fact, im adjusting a lot of options to save as much battery as i can and holding me back to not to play every single time in the day, but its very hard to keep my hands away from him. I'm loving it.!!!"
1746,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"I was really nervous buying this phone at first because of all the bad reviews. But I was pleasantly surprised when I got the phone and it was in perfect condition. Absolutely nothing wrong with the body of the phone, no bumps or scratches. And the battery life was at 97% which really surprised me. I did think the packaging could have been a bit better. Everything inside was loose and shook around a lot. Other than that Iâ€™m really happy with my purchase."
1747,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,Phone looks good but only issue is battery life.  I wish this would have been better but as a refurbished this is what it is.
1748,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"I'm reviewing this more as what you may expect from a renewed device.Mine was purchased through seller: Kiss Electronics IncThe phone is in decent condition, has the usual damage from being in a case all its life, doesn't show much damage which would come from being out of a case. It also came with a glass type screen protector as they do despite not being too scratched up.The screen, however, was cracked. I have attached a picture of where the crack is.Kinda cringe that I received a phone with a crack in the screen, but it is very minor and should not affect the usage. I'll choose to keep it despite this problem, because it's too much effort to send it back, and it will still fulfill it's intended use. No point in sending it to a landfill.Turning it on, it appeared to be set up or prepared with apple configurator, as it did not ask for any setup steps aside from wifi connection. This breaks apple's terms of use I'm pretty sure.It accepts a sim card fine so at this point I added it to my apple DEP and to my MDM, to which it did just fine (meaning it wasnt previously enrolled to anyone else's company).The phone is fully functional, no battery service messages, truetone works, no warnings, faceID is fine, nothing indicating the phone having had a third party repair. Came with 86% battery life left, I cant be bothered to test the capacity. Overall it functions perfectly as intended.I was feeling extra bored today so I decided to validate Amazon's promise on the device accessories that the cable is MFI certified and the charger brick is UL listed.It came with a sharkk branded charger and cable.The charger brick has a license and model number printed on it which come up as registered by Shenzhen DBK Electronics.I can not find any connection between sharkk and DBK.I did find just one of the other 13 model numbers on the UL cert to also be a sharkk product.For the cable, sharkk is not listed in Apple's MFI Authorized Manufacturers list.Shenzhen DBK is also not in Apple's MFI Authorized Manufacturers list.it was included a sim card removal tool which was actually really good quality. it is much flatter than the normal stamped steel ones and had a much higher quality finish.I bought this to issue out to an employee as a company phone."
1749,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"whenever i send videos on snapchat or on on call then the audio will cut out. itâ€™ll slowly sound like iâ€™m under water then itâ€™ll cut out. idk why, itâ€™s never happened on any other phone. but other than that i love it. sometimes the screen will freeze or not recognize iâ€™m pressing it either for a second."
1750,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"This is a great seller to buy the iPhone X.  The phone came unlocked and with little to no issues. I appreciated the service done for me, if you want this phone buy it!"
1751,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,"The phone arrived a day earlier than we expected, which was wonderful! Our granddaughter that we got the phone had to leave early the next morning but the phone beat her departure. There were NO scraches, or signs that it wasn't new! The battery life said 100%, we didn't expect that!! We know we were very blessed/lucky but this company has held up their end exceptionally, I wouldn't mind referring anyone to them and if we need to replace a phone they will be on the top of our list. Again Very Pleased with them."
1752,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,Love this iPhone. Easy to use.
1753,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,GREAT PRODUCT GREAT PRICE
1754,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,The face recognition sometimes doesn't recognize my face and I have to put in the code for apps it works fine other than that I have no complaints came brand new no scratches or problems Overall I'm happy and would recommend to family and friends
1755,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,I got this as an anniversary gift for my fiance  I was worried how he would like it with the no home button. His previous IPhone SE was his first smart phone. He loved it the face recognition is his favorite.
1756,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,The battery life was definitely a step up from my previous devices and as someone who spends a lot of time on my screen it was more than I could hope for as it would last nearly the entire day. And the face recognition had its moments where I would have to try a second time but it worked better than I had thought.
1757,Apple,IPhone X,64 GB,IOS,5.8 Inches,the seller hybrid it sold me an iphone x 64 gb with a defective battery and a screen with a good amount of dead pixels!  otherwise they are very understandable!

It clearly states it comes WITH a charger - thats incorrect, there is NONE in the box!  Its a weird power cable also, both ends the same, so I have no other charger I can use as a substitute.  Now having to ORDER a charger separately, its $14.00!"

1764,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Lo tengo en mis manos desde el 11-10-2022; y hoy 11-11-2022 hago mi reseÃ±a para compartir mi experiencia.Aunque es la primera vez que compro un telÃ©fono con 8GB de RAM, puedo decir que estoy muy complacido con mi compra, ya que mi anterior telÃ©fono tenÃ­a 3GB.En cuanto al espacio de 128GB, me siento bastante bien y conforme, ya que antes tenÃ­a que estar eliminando Apps, Fotos y Videos para tener mÃ¡s espacio disponible.Algo que deseaba tener de un telÃ©fono es el puerto Tipo C, ya que es mucho mÃ¡s cÃ³modo y eficiente; y por suerte, ya lo van a estandarizar, por lo que todos los telÃ©fonos del mundo que salgan a partir de ahÃ­ lo tendrÃ¡n.El tamaÃ±o de la pantalla es excelente, ya que, hace mucho que querÃ­a tener un telÃ©fono con una pantalla de mÃ¡s de 6 pulgadas, ya que asÃ­ todo se ve mucho mejor y ayuda a no forzar tanto la vista.Me encanta la idea de que mantenga las actualizaciones al dÃ­a, asÃ­ podrÃ© sentirme un poco mÃ¡s seguro, ademÃ¡s de la optimizaciÃ³n del equipo, que siempre viene incluida.La cÃ¡mara de 48 MegapÃ­xeles y el excelente Zoom me tienen complacido; solo que a veces pone las fotos como con ambientes que hacen que no tengan la suficiente nitidez y calidad, pero he notado que lo hace cuando el clima exterior no estÃ¡ normal y soleado. La cÃ¡mara frontal tambiÃ©n estÃ¡ muy bien.Ahora puedo jugar mis juegos favoritos con total libertad y movilidad; aunque, hay algunos que siempre exigen mÃ¡s, por lo que, en Ã©se caso, solo me adapto.Se siente bastante bien al agarrarlo, ya que es liviano, suave y fino; y aunque el protector es fino y delicado, le puse un PopSocket para poder agarrarlo con mayor comodidad, ya que se me hace difÃ­cil usar un telÃ©fono sin Ã©se accesorio.Me gusta la idea de que tenga el cristal Gorilla Glass 4; que aunque tengo otros protectores para el telÃ©fono y la pantalla en mi carro de Amazon, me siento un poco confiado de que si se me cae, no se me daÃ±arÃ¡ la pantalla muy fÃ¡cil; ademÃ¡s, me siento tranquilo al poder poner llaves en el bolsillo junto a Ã©l, ya que antes tenÃ­a que tener cuidado y usar un bolsillo exclusivo para el telÃ©fono, para evitar rayones en la pantalla.TambiÃ©n me he adaptado a la nueva forma de usar el telÃ©fono sin botones en la parte de abajo; ya que al tener la opciÃ³n de ""ir atrÃ¡s"" con solo deslizar hacia la izquierda o la derecha en los bordes, es mucho mÃ¡s cÃ³modo, fÃ¡cil y eficiente.Otra opciÃ³n que me encanta muchÃ­simo es la de la ""llave inteligente"", que es el botÃ³n del lado izquierdo, ya que ahÃ­ configurÃ© las capturas de pantalla con un solo toque, ya que hago capturas a cada rato sobre los juegos que voy jugando, entre otras cosas; y la linterna la puse con 2 clics porque al ponerla con 1 se puede activar al meterse el telÃ©fono en el bolsillo o al ser tocado sin interÃ©s de encenderla.Tiene muy buen sonido y se siente bien al escuchar lo que voy viendo y sin problemas de calidad.El sensor de huellas digitales estÃ¡ alucinante, ya que tiene una sensibilidad muy buena.Sin embargo, no uso protecciÃ³n con huella digital por Seguridad, ya que, un PolicÃ­a mal intencionado o un delincuente, pueden obligarte por la fuerza a poner tu dedo o dedos para abrir tu telÃ©fono y robarte dinero o informaciÃ³n que no tienes interÃ©s en compartir; por eso solo uso un patrÃ³n, ya que, aunque alguien intente ver de lejos, es mÃ¡s difÃ­cil seguir la ruta de tus dedos; pero no serÃ­a igual si pones un PIN.Hasta ahora lo Ãºnico que no me ha funcionado de las opciones internas es la del NFC, ya que solo aparece la opciÃ³n de configuraciÃ³n avanzada (en inglÃ©s), pero al tocarla no lleva a ningÃºn sitio; y cuando abro alguna App que permite pagos sin contacto, al buscar la tecnologÃ­a en el telÃ©fono y no encontrarla, se sale.En fin, estoy satisfecho con el telÃ©fono; y con relaciÃ³n al tema de los pagos NFC, deberÃ­an resolver eso con tiempo, ya que hoy en dÃ­a eso es muy necesario e importante y deberÃ­a de estar funcionando con normalidad; aunque, espero que corrijan el error en alguna actualizaciÃ³n.Sin dudas mi compra de otro telÃ©fono mÃ¡s adelante serÃ¡ de la Marca Umidigi, ya que ofrecen dispositivos de alta calidad con garantÃ­a, a muy bajo costo.Gracias por tu tiempo.Gracia y Paz."
1765,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The Umidigi F3 is the perfect mid-range mobile phone for the user who wants a balance of performance and price. This phone has a premium features, more-than-acceptable camera, excellent battery life, and speedy processor.Premium Features: The F3 includes features that you would find in pricier phones.  You can unlock the phone via the front camera or the side button fingerprint reader.  I happen to prefer using the side button over the screen reader on most other phones because of convenience.  The F3 also includes an FM radio receiver built in.  How cool is that!?!  Another capability that you no longer find in most phones is a headset jack.  You have the option to use both wired and wireless headsets.  Although the screen is only 1650 x 720, everything is bright and clear.  Playing non-graphics intensive games has been great with no motion issues.Camera: The F3 triple rear cameras and single front camera are more than acceptable for the regular user.  Selfies turn out sharp and clear and photos with the rear photos have clarity that match more expensive phones like the Samsung S21 (I couldn't believe it either...and my significant other is quite ticked off on how much she spent on her S21...LOL).Battery: The F3 has a 5150 mAh battery, which surpasses almost every other phone out there.  I can easily wait 2 days before having to recharge the phone.  Only negative is that there is no wireless charging.Processor:  This is the biggest surprise for me with the F3.  The MediaTek Helio P70 was fast with no noticeable lagging when navigating apps, playing games, and editing documents.  Granted, the chip cannot handle graphics hogging games, but then, most phones can't either.In general, I would recommend the Umidigi F3 to anyone who wants a phone that provides higher value than the price would indicate.  This would also make a great second phone or one for your younger kids."
1766,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The specs seem good on paper, but it struggles when connected to my car with Google Auto. It's pretty good otherwise, most applications run with no perf issues.The location of the fingerprint reader (part of the on/off button) is uncomfortable - most times I hold it, one of my fingers is there, and the reader tries to decipher it even though I didn't want that.All in all, a mediocre phone that's somewhat disappointing compared to the older S3Pro. The only reason I replaced the S3 Pro is that Umidigi doesn't provide any updates for it, so it's stuck with Android 9."
1767,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Still learning about what all this phone can do but all in all I'm very happy with this purchase. Especially after agonizing for 2 weeks as to what phone to get. I'm glad I chose this
1768,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,First off had a heck of a time getting it to hook up to my wifi.  Kept telling me was connected but no internet. I still tried to open Chrome told me my date and time were wrong so couldn't do a hand off. Here the date was Nov 2004 and was set to somewhere in Mexico. Once corrected that seemed to fix it that!  my old Umidigi was 3 yrs old and the battery was dying. So far so good with getting on US Mobile was a breeze. Will try to update.
1769,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,It's okay.
1770,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The umidigi F3, another umidigi phone entering my household. This has been number 5? So I may be biased, but there's a reason I've identified so well with this brand. They produce quality inexpensive phones. The hardware you get for the price you spend is easily twice as much as other competitors.I know and trust umidigi, they update their software, they support their customers, and they make awesome tech. Trusting a company, especially one that most people haven't heard of, is such an awesome thing.I get a phone with a wonderful camera, good battery life, that's stylish, comes with a case and screen protector, all for less than what most garbage phones in the states ask for.Ask yourself do you actually want to keep buying phones that are overpriced or don't work? No of course not. Umidigis f3 phone works in there U.S they make actually global, global phones.All this on basically stock android too, no horrible software bloat like the major companies I've bought from add into their phones.Give umidigi a try, My house uses them, my uncle uses them, and my friends use them."
1771,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Mil veces mejor que un Samsun o Hawei
1772,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"This is a performance phone for $200. UMIDIGI is a go to phone if you want a cheap phone with high end specs. Well worth the price.. why?Pros:8GB Ram and 128 GB internal storage. Plenty for smooth operation and storageGreat Pictures from Sony Cameras.. my attached pics were taken with the phone. Crisp clear pictures!The short cut button is customizable and really helpful for frequent tasks and quick launch of appsThe humongous battery and fast charging together, they give you a peace of mind for days. Turn off the ""screen on when you pickup"" function from settings if you want to extend batter lifeGlobal 4G network compatibility without loss of speed and reliabilityAudio is loud and clearNo bloatware.. this is very important for meCons:Android 11 - will it ever get to 12?Not a 5G phoneThe finger print scanner is the power button.. it's really sensitive and I accidentally turned the phone off multiple times, while trying to setup fingerprint. I would've also preferred an in screen finger print scannerI'll continue to update this as I use the phone.. overall, I recommend this phone if you are looking for a cheap high performance phone."
1773,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"This phone is a perfect mid-ranger. I believe it's perfect for kids to adults that just want a reliable device that runs without lag. I have been using Umidigi devices for years now. They all still work without issues for all this time. I still use an Umidigi S3 Pro as my Pokefone. This is still a brand that provides a case, a screen protector, and a charger ! The battery lasts all day, the screen is nice and big, and the back looks great. It has a shortcut button that let's you choose whatever app you want to open with a single click. And then you can choose a different app for a double click. I usually pick the flashlight for that. And then a press and hold for a 3rd app. I love that if you choose to navigate with gestures, there is not hint bar like on Pixel devices, yo get a nice full screen. This phone has zero bloat. This phone has 8gb of ram so you won't have any slowdowns. And if you are Android tinkerer like myself, it is very easy to root this device. At this price point this is a no brainer."
1774,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"                    The media could not be loaded.
                



Â For 200 bucks ( + taxes if applicable). Umidigi F3 is a great phone for everyday use, with 8 GB memory and 128 Gigs of internal storage, there's no worry of running out of storage because of pics or apps.The battery capacity for Umidigi phones have been at the 5050mAh which gives more than a day of good usage easily too, I have another Umidigi Phone (s3 Pro) for 2+ yrs now which still gives a day plus of usage.Having used this phone for a couple of days now, and haven't experienced any lags or missed touch response.The UX has been kept close to stock and not a ton of default Apps come installed which is great!Easily able to connect to 4G LTE networks ( TMobile and AT&T). Camera quality is good for this price range. The customizable button comes in handy for frequent operations.It also comes with a charger/USB3 charging cable, a screen protector applied and a protector case!!The only thing that I think could have been better was if it came with Android 12, it runs Android 11, I hope that it gets Android 12 upgrade soon.Overall a great value!"
1775,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"If you are looking for ""bang for the buck,"" this is it.  First off, I have to say that I am a bit prejudiced. I've owned a Umidigi F1 Play for several years and it has been faultless.  When I saw this F3 at $161.49 I thought I would try it.  After receiving it I found its large screen, 6.7"", to be bright and exactly the size I wanted.  After starting it up the processor was blazing fast.  Another big plus is the reception.  I have found dead spots with my other phones in my area.  This one pulled in a signal where others could not.  I was disappointed in one area, transferring apps and data from my old phone.  I tried Bluetooth and NFC and I could not connect to my old Umidigi F1 Play.  It may have been me or there was a compatibility issue between the two phones.  What you get with this phone is a good camera, great performance, outstanding connectivity, and an unbeatable price."
1776,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The silver color looks so pretty. Features of camera are powerful and really useful, I like the extrawide angle mode. The screen is big and bright and crisp. Big battery, 8g of memory, 128g of storage, mainstream configuration, smooth operation, clear and bright sound, and importantly no annoying app built in ---- I don't like being forced to cram in a lot of junk. Also commendable is the gift of a beautiful transparent phone case.However, the adapter is always so big due to fast charging.  My power strip is overcrowded  :("
1777,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Iâ€™ve owned several union phones. The phones do not feel cheap or miss essential features. The new f3 actually is a great phone. Is better than the Samsung a series. The photos are quite good, the phone is zippy, the screen is bright and crisp. I am actually impressed. It paired with my watch and no problems with Wi-Fi or lagging in videos. Those phone is actually worth more then theyâ€™re charging. Iâ€™ve given cheaper phones to the kids and they actually prefer this phone and want me to buy one for their birthday."
1778,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Trying to reset access point name information hopefully it will be compatible with TracFone
1779,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Good display for being 720p, easy to hold with 20:6:9 aspect ratio. Beware description says stereo speakers but bottom firing speaker only."
1780,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I like the phone a lottttt, but the matte silver looks a lot darker than the one advertised in the pictures. I'll be returning it for a black one. My Qlink wireless sim card works good in this phone. Great size and price"
1781,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I must admit it is a very nice looking device.  However I'm not sure if it's a 4g or LTE phone. I tried to get it activated on 3 different service providers and neither could get the phone activated. But looked good,  camera seemed nice,  screen was clear but while using super fast xfinity internet it seemed a little slower than I expected."
1782,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Wow wow wow!!! This is a beautiful phone for a fraction of what phones usually cost. Brand new and packaged beautifully. It works like a charm and I am very proud to call this my phone. The more expensive brands are so overrated and they charge too much. This phone is worth it folks!
1783,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,The phone has a great finish and the battery life is insaneits easy to set up just put my sim in and its up and runningthe headphone jack is a plus
1784,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Phone was locked for Boost, but they have made every reasonable attempt to take care of it."
1785,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Battery life is Great! And the picture quality is Awesome, been watching more of my shows on the go. Umidigi has come up Big!"
1786,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Make sure you read everything
1787,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Unboxed, set up wifi, transfer all stuff from my old phone, man I love this phone, up until I put my Sim in. The Mrs got a text from cell carrier that my number was deleted from the account, phone locked up no internet no text, no calls nothing. Att/cricket text said to immediately put my Sim in my old phone or reactivation fees will be incurred. Switch back Sim to old phone call them up they say its a 3g phone, I said no I made sure it was 4g, check imei numbers it's 3g.best of luck this is my 6th umidigi but the last 2 have been no goes because of being 3g but labeled 4g"
1788,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,The battery lasts all-day! Even with me using the phone the entire day it had 17% charge when I went to bad. I bluetooth music to my bedroom stereo and play it all night. Music was still playing when I woke. The phone works lightning âš¡ fast. The facial recognition is nice. Fingerprint is iffy. I have problems with fingerprint readers on every phone I have owned. The F1 seems to be getting better with the fingerprint reader as I use it more. Great phone for an excellent price.
1789,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"It says unlocked to all carriers but,it's wrong and false advertisement because,I took it to cricket and tried to get this phone on with a new sim card .and they said it's not compatible with cricket service so I'm having to send this phone back before I can even get my 200 back so I'm not very happy,and the seller needs put on here who it is and who it is not compatible with because,it's bull crap when you got unlock to all carriers when's it's not so if you have cricket do not buy this phone bc it won't work...."
1790,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"El equipo en general llegÃ³ en buenas condiciones, la pantalla tiene un pixel muerto pero en general el celular funciona bien"
1791,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Really great for the price, I've heard some iffy reviews of camera, but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. The tones are a tad warm, and you have to take the time to focus correctly in bokeh(portrait) mode, but all in all very satisfied. Quick and powerful. I'd buy it again."
1792,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Muy buen celular justo en cuanto a exigencias de organizaciÃ³n y procesacion de programas muy rÃ¡pido con muy buena baterÃ­a y a un excelente precio no le pide nada a los de gama alta
1793,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I love love love this UMIDIGI Smartphone. This is the perfect size. Response is very fast. The look is streamlined. The color, which is a dreamy color RED is not too bright , just right.  Kind of satin looking. The weight is perfect. I am so happy!!! Just get this exceptionally beautiful high end phone."
1794,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Good phone.. Value for money. Bought it for discount.
1795,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,This is not good at all.
1796,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Hasta aora todo funciona perfectamente
1797,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,The camera on this phone is crap. For 48 and 16 megapixal camera. It's cheaply made. And then to compare it with Samsung camera that's just lie and deceptive. Now the speaker not working. It's I rip off. Not worth the cost.  I wanted a phone because my phone stopped working but this is garbage
1798,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Update July 2020.After having the phone for a few weeks, a few dead pixels show up, in the middle of the screen, only noticeable in black backgrounds. They sent a new one with no problem, and I am in the process to returning the old one. The new one is working great so far, we had to go back to metropcs to activate the sim card in the new one, this time they charge us 25 dlls, we like this phone a lot, the battery is durable, the camera is great. I am planning to order another one for my self, this one is for my boyfriend, he works at construction so that is why the screen protector is already damage in the old phone, for normal use it will be fine for a while. I didn't find any good hard case protector in amazon, but I tried at the store the case for Moto G Stylus and it did fit the phone, the only problem are the buttons in the case, they don't match, but I don't mind, I am planning to make a hole or something, because I really need a good sturdy case before my boyfriend crack the phone.June-2020Arrive on time, despite the seller didn't gave any tracking information. The phone works great and the battery life is good, has 1 slot for 1 SIM only, and the 2nd slot is for a SIM or a SD card. Is working fine with metro-pcs, despite we had to go to different customer service places, because in the 1st one they just say that phone won't work with metropcs, they only switch the SIM from the old phone to the new one, of course that didn't work! american cell phones companies married the SIM with the imei, so the company has to do the process first. in the second place, the lady was really helpful and start the process immediately, took like 5 minutes and cost under 17 dlls. I also tried a mexican SIM from movistar and works really good, I didn't even had to add the configuration for APN, to have 4G, automatically did it, not like other unlock phones I had before. The camera is decent, and the apps run smoothly, comes with one screen protector installed and a simple black case, flexible."
1799,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Pones are nice however they donâ€™t work with tracfone.
1800,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Had the Play F1 for 17 months and very happy with the phone for the price. Easily the best battery life of any phone I have owned. Can get over 10 hours screen on time staying between 10 and 90 percent as do not charge to 100 or deplete under 10 to protect the battery. Call quality is good, speaker is loud enough, screen size and colors are great. Camera is just okay, when you really blow up images, the detail is not there. Although I'm comparing to a Pixel 2, so can't expect it. Performance is fine and never noticed any slow functions. I do not game, so no review on gaming.Phone has many bands and have used it in USA and all over Asia with multiple sims and works very well.  Dual sim feature is nice to have."
1801,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Great camera
1802,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I got this and it don't work.  It won't turn on.  They are sending me another one and ifnit don't work I am done with it.
1803,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Great great
1804,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Nothing bad to say except I wish the case that came with it was a hard case. The case is so flimsy. It won't stop it from being damaged if I drop it.

1806,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I am happy with this phone, it is cheap but very nice and fast, the battery lasts a long time"
1807,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I usually wait a whole month after purchasing a phone to review but I've had this phone for only 4 days and I hate it!! When i saw all of these 5 star reviews i was very skeptical because this brand never gets more than 3 stars and now i see why! First, the sound is horrible, so low that whenever I watched a video or movie i had to bring the phone close to my face to be able to hear correctly! I always used closed caption because the sound is unbelievably low!! While watching videos the images often would become very pixilated. The front camera is terrible too! Also whenever a call comes in while im doing something on my phone, the caller ID isn't displayed and I'm unable to answer the call! There are a few other annoying things but those were the most bothersome for me and because of that I'm not keeping this phone and I'll never purchase this brand again!!"

I have Verizon wireless which i put in search engine but still it gave me this Total company that tries get new customers using other company name.
1815,Total wireless,Samsung Galaxy A13,128 GB,Android 11.0 (R OS),6.5 Inches,Order this phone and this phone is locked to TracFone. It is not locked to Verizon Wireless. Ordered a replacement and the replacement is locked to TracFone and not Verizon Wireless. With a whole TracFone chip in it. Different SIM cards different barcodes like somebody took the phone out of the box and resealed it.
1816,Total wireless,Samsung Galaxy A13,128 GB,Android 11.0 (R OS),6.5 Inches,It says Verizon so I thought I could use it with my plan. You cannot! To use this phone you must switch to a provider company named Total.

1820,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"I didn't know what to think when I purchased this phone.  It was a quick decision when my old Samsung just suddenly went out on me.  But here I am about a week after the purchase and this phone has really impressed me.  I was able to transfer all my old apps, contacts and even pictures with ease.  I really have zero complaints about this phone.  My plan was to have this phone until I could go out and find a more expensive phone.  But now, I think I'll just keep this one as my main phone.  For the price, you really can't beat it."
1821,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"This cellie is relatively inexpensive and seems to work as well as those costing a Whole Lot More!(My only beef is the quality of the photos -- but at 8 mp I guess they're ""standard""!-? --And don't use the magnifier: take ""normal sight"" photos and ""work them up"" in a photo editor -- much better results!)--And Oh -- the phone does NOT come with any ""guidebook"" -- even online the info is pretty sketchy, but I guess the manufacturer thinks all cellphones work the same way! --NOT!)"
1822,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,Got it for my dad so need to use more to give a feedback
1823,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"I got this for my daughter since she likes to forget her phone everywhere.  So far nobody has bothered to steal it.  It always gets returned(unlike the expensive iPhones).As for the phone itself, it has to be turned off and turned back on about once per week, the pictures aren't good at all but it looks like an expensive phone.  I couldn't imagine using this myself but it's good enough for a clumsy kid that loses and breaks phones all the time."
1824,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"I live in an area where I need AT&T for Tracfone and needs to be unlocked. I have only had the phone for a few days and seems to work well. The Assistant is fun to use. Say Good Morning and it goes thru time, weather, news and anything you need to hear/see for the day. I bought a leather wallet phone cover (includes glass screen protector) from Amazon and is great ($11.99) I used Bluetooth to transfer my contacts from old phone to this one and worked well. I am still exploring all the things this phone can do."
1825,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,Itâ€™s ok for the money
1826,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"This is a TCL A30 phone.  Phone is kind of smallish and boxy.  Nothing flashy about it.  No fingerprint sensor.  No button on back.  I'm fine with all that.  If you are looking for the latest style you may be disappointed.  This phone actually has a replaceable battery,  I love that.  The reason I got this phone is because it is a 5G phone.  I needed at least 4G for my network now.  I think many phone networks are requiring 4G/5G now or soon.  The phone comes with Android 11.  Worked well for me.  Phone is pretty inexpensive.  It's a good value for me."
1827,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"I got this smartphone to replace my old iPhone 6s since I wanted to try an Android Smartphone this time. I found several brand new phones from TCL news and eventually chose the A30 one.The phone and its battery were seperately placed in the package box when it was delivered. It was quite easy to assemble the battery into the phone. You can even do that without the quick start guide. The package is also pretty which does not look like just a $100 phone.The cellphone's processing and operations run really smoothly and quickly. You can open multiple apps one time and it will not affect its speed. I downloaded several newly released games such as Diablo Immortal and Genshin Impact, and all of them operated smoothly. The only concern is that the smartphone does not come with an additional RAM disk and it only has 32GB storage. So if you would like to download a lot of games or large apps, I would recommend you to buy another disk and insert it into the phone. A30 does provide a place to insert another memory disk.In addition, it supports multiple Google apps which had been pre-installed on the phone. You don't need to spend a lot of time to find the apps and install them. The battery is also very long-lasting. I used it to play Genshin Impact for several hours with all best graphic setting, it still had much power left.Overall, it's worthy with only $100 to get this impressive phone. If you have a budget plan for your smartphone, I would strongly recommend this TCL A30."
1828,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"The phone is really good, delivered on time, and it was just what I wanted but I could not fit in the sim card, slot too small. I have to return it and look for something else that I would fit my sim card.Grace B"
1829,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,Maybe the battery life is poor and one will need a back up battery if used a lot daily Please do note that I had to factory reset this phone several times in order to get it going I was going to return it but by restarting it again and again it now seem to be worth the money I paid for it So for me it was a good deal
1830,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,So far the phone is okay except that I donâ€™t know when I receive voicemail. No voicemail icon to be notify when I received a voicemail. I called my carrier and after several attempt to help I was told to call TCL.I called TCL was on the phone for over 15 minutes with a representative and the line wascut off. So I may have to return the phone cause I canâ€™t be calling my voicemail several times in a day just to find out if I have voicemail. What kind of phone that donâ€™t have voicemail icon ornotification to find out out about your voicemail?9/2/2022This seller tried multiplied times to reach me and finally I was able to resolve the issue. Thank you!
1831,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"Decently fast, smallish battery, no problems, until I saw there was no way to enable wifi calling.... because there is no wifi calling on this phone (except with T-mobile, apparently). I used this for a couple days and returned it. Tech support did respond right away confirming this..."
1832,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,Stopped working after 5 months but the company was really good to work with and refunded us promptly and were sorry for the inconvenience.
1833,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,I was disappointed when I saw that it wasn't a built-in battery phone.
1834,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,It's a little laggy and nothing too fancy. But it's fine. I just needed a quick replacement for my old phone since the battery kept dying too quickly.
1835,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"Display quality is ok, the camera is atrocious for how new it is, and the speakers are also awful. It's a good basic phone for doing basic tasks, and even some on the more difficult side. Low storage for how new it is, and the ram is also a bit disappointing."
1836,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"Works Ok, but hope phone design improves next time.  The biggest flaw with this one is that the on/off button is on the right side where the volume buttons are also located.  So have to be careful and look where I'm putting my finger every time.  It'd be best to have the a physical home/shut off button at the button like the old Samsung J3 did.  Also, during a call the screen turns black after 2 minutes following the screensaver setting.  However, the screen should remain lit during a call because, when you're ready to hang up, you have to look for the unfriendly shut off button."
1837,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,Was not compatible with sprint
1838,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"First off . . . $99 phone.That being said, I feel I got my money's worth. It works fine. The camera is decent. The battery life is decent. If you want fancy stuff, spend a little more money.The only thing I could do without is that it's still micro USB. Type C would've been awesome. But then again . . . $99.So far so good. The battery will last me a whole day (I'm not stuck on it playing games or streaming videos). I use it as my basic phone. I'm not a picture-phile. The camera gets the job done for me. I do listen to music on it. No complaints. Battery is decent. no lagging. Calls come in, they go out, and they sound clear to me.If you want a phone for phone stuff, I recommend it.If you want a phone to live out of, I suggest investing a bit more for something more ""flagship"". An iPhone or Samsung perhaps ğŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸.O recommend it."
1839,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"If it wasn't for the convenience of smart phones I would go back to a flip phone. I use my phone as a GPS on my bike, and being able to take decent photos on the fly is handy.My last phone was too damn big, stuck out of my back pocket, wouldn't fit in my handlebar mount or touchscreen bag.Grabbed this, smaller than typical, phone and couldn't be happier. I'm cheap when it comes to phones. I'm not spending hundreds on an iphone mini, sure it would probably be a bit faster and have a better quality camera, but this thing does the job and costs significantly less."
1840,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"I only bought this phone for travel to use with local sims to make and receive calls, and it is fine for that.  However, seller needs to update product description because the phone DOES NOT work on Verizon network or any other network outside ATT and Sprint, which is spelled out in its settings."
1841,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"Worth the money, only 99, but works good."
1842,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,Good phone.
1843,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,Camera quality is not good. But what can you expect from a $100 phone. Rest everything works as expected.
1844,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"I got this to replace my old Samsung A3s and I also have many TCL TVs and other products and they're known to have good value for the price. This TCL A30 has so many features, I was amazed by the price. Inside the box are the phone, removable battery, micro-USB cable, power adapter, and user manual. Setting up was really easy only took me 10 minutes, and the battery lasted me for days with 6 hours+ of screen-on time every day, good screen I have no problem playing games or watching movies, and with expandable storage I can add a micro SD card to have even more storage if I ever need it, excellent call quality with loudspeakers and good cameras for that also has facial recognition and many more features. Overall very well worth the price. Highly recommended"
1845,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"I wanted my daughter to start learning more about phones and how they work, get familiar with the tech, etc. I tried giving her one of my old, retired phones, but performance just wasn't there. I got this for her to use WiFi only (no SIM card, for now).I liked it so much I almost bought one for myself. It's quick and responsive, battery life is good, camera is decent. My daughter loves it for emailing and chatting with grandma, watching YT, playing a few games and setting alarms and reminders.The only thing I found missing was a fingerprint sensor, so I opted for the TCL 10L for myself."
1846,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"This phone reminds me why I hate tech with every passing year.The power button is in the most nonsensical place, so get usedto unlocking it every time you go to change the volume.I don't know how a company can build high tech products withabsolutely no concern for the end user, Tech reached it's peak withthe Motorola Razr in 2003 - I only wish mine still worked causethis phone Suxxx!  Horrible sound quality of a .10 cent speaker as well."
1847,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"This phone was purchased as a present for my father's birthday. He insisted on a phone that supported SD cards because he had spent years storing music and photographs on his SD card. I'm not sure why, but over the last few years, phone manufacturers have gradually abandoned the SD card capability. When I assumed I'd have to hunt for an older model, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this newer phone retained this capability, as well as a 3.5mm headphone jack, allowing my father to continue using his headphones.After using it for the past few days, we noticed that there is some minor lag in this phone when browsing pages but it is totally acceptable. Also, the camera is not the best. Overall, my father is very pleased with the phone. I also plan to buy a second one for my mum."
1848,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"I've always wanted to purchase a cheap unlocked backup phone for around $ 100 . There really aren't many options in this price range, so I haven't been able to find one that I'm happy with. A few days ago, my friend highly recommended this phone to me. Although I hadn't heard of the brand, I decided to give it a try.Â Overall, the experience of this phone is excellent. It certainly can't compare to Â iPhone.However, basic operations such as answering calls, surfing the internet, watching videos etc., are all done smoothly by this phone. The most amazing thing for me is long Â battery life; exceeded my expectations. A single charge on this phone will last at least two days with moderate use. I will definitely keep this phone and continue to use it. Recommend to those on a tight budget who need a backup phone."
1849,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,Not sure what people expect for 99 dollars. This is a great value phone. Can't beat it on other unlocked phones.
1850,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"The only things outdated on this phone is the camera quality and the physical screen quality as far as I can tell, but you won't notice a thing if you aren't a tech geek like myself. I'm really impressed by the battery life, I had music playing through Bluetooth earbuds all throughout my 8 hour shift yesterday and the battery went from 88% to 50% on this little 3000mah battery which Is incredibly good. The standby battery life is great too, I charged it fully this morning and almost 12 hours later it's on 93% though I've only made 2 calls anda couple internet searches. I've no idea how this things battery last longer than my broken galaxy s21 which has better specs all around, but I won't question it."
1851,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"I got this to replace my Moto G Stylus. At first, I thought this would not compare with a Moto product, but I was AMAZED!! The screen is large, and I could watch videos and play games on it all day. The battery is good too. The other day I spent 4 hours playing games, and it still had 50% power left after I finished. The phone is compatible with T-Mobile and AT&T Network and works great with these carriers. I knew that TCL produces nice TVs, but I donâ€™t know they sell great mobile phones too! I am very satisfied and would recommend this product highly. I got this to replace my Moto G Stylus. At first, I thought this would not compare with a Moto product, but I was AMAZED!!

1852,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"would be fine if it works. My phone showed ""slow charging"" from the first day with the original charger and cable. I ignored that because the phone seem to work. But it dead within a year and can no longer be charged. Had to pay them $20 shipping for warranty. And they didn't reply emails, had to call a couple times."
1853,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"The phone is ok, but it has no face recognition, not much features, however itâ€™s okay for its value"
1854,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,The TCL 30 works and can play multiple apps with no issue!I had a issue with the quality and customer service was exceptional and received an upgrade above and beyond what was expected! Definitely recommend the seller!â—
1855,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,Do not purchase a TCL phone.  The one I bought worked for two months and then would no longer connect to the Verizon network.  Verizon could not correct the problem.  I am trying to return the phone but TCL customer service is extremely poor.  I honestly don't think I'll be able to return it even though it still looks brand new.  I've been trying for a week to retrurn it but they make it so difficult that I think their ploy is that eventually you will get fed up and give up trying to return the phone.  I retract the good comments I made aboout the phone prior to it going bad.
1856,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,It canâ€™t quite keep up with what I need a fone to do. Iâ€™d buy Samsung or apple.
1857,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"A perfect phone for the elderlySince my mother's last phone lacked a front camera, I ordered the TCL A30 for her so she could make video calls with her grandchild and me. The phone's back is composed of hard plastic, but it does not feel cheap in hand. My mother likes the size of the phone. It's the perfect size for her to slip into her pocket. Other than that, the phone is easy to use. Everything was put up in less than ten minutes. Now, my mum has learned to make video calls, read online newspapers and take selfies with this phone."
1858,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,Very good phone for the moneyI originally rated three stars because the phone does not support WiFi calling (except on T-Mobile) however the company reached out to me with an offer to remedy the situation so I decided to change my review because I was impressed with their customer service.
1859,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,Spend a little more money and get a better cellphone. This phone is very fragil and you must open the back to add battery and SIM card. I returned.
1860,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,It was good for the price.
1861,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"Despite the fact that I already have an iPhone, I require a second phone for work. Because of the low price, I chose to get the TCL A30. The battery's performance is rather good. I used it for the entire day, and when I got home it still had about 30% of its power left. I believe that a single charge will be sufficient for most people's everyday needs. You don't have to carry about a bulky power bank or phone charger."
1862,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,The only thing I am not satisfied is that this phone does NOT support Wifi 5Ghz.
1863,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"This works great as a phone, but not very good screen resolution. Good as a back up if you need a phone right away"
1864,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"Works with Mint Mobile, but not compatible with their WiFi calling. Battery usage time is fine ,but it takes a long time to fully charge. When roaming (in Mexico) I could not read group text messages, but solo messages worked fine (could be a Mint thing)"
1865,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,Like all the features!  Great phone for the price! Very happyğŸ˜€ğŸ˜€
1866,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,What was not explained above?
1867,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"I bought this phone as a cheap replacement for when my original phone died after years of use. This phone cost $100, which at all the time I thought was expensive but I needed a daily phone. Sadly even for $100 it has a bad screen, is very glitchy, very unresponsive and has a terrible build quality. After 9 months it suddenly died, would not take a charge. While within the 12 month warranty TCL refused to refund and would only repair it if I paid the $20 shipping fee. A faulty phone, bought directly through the official TCL storefront on Amazon and they wanted me to pay a fifth of price to repair their bad product. I know the price seems tempting to save some money but pay a few more dollars for a different phone as you will regret buying this phone. Bad company and product. Never buying a TCL product ever again."
1868,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"The product box came open. The seal was broken, although not being totally satisfied with the way my product came, the costumer service of TCL was amazing, they sent me a message regarding my concern, and they easily refunded my money without having to even return the phone.I am very satisfied with the customer service of TCL, they really help us if the order doesnâ€™t come as it should be."
1869,TCL,TCL A30,32 GB,Android 11,5.5 Inches,"Phone setup and steps to use this phone are terrible, even 3 engineers from verizon had a hard time getting it to work properly on their system, 6 days and many hours on the phone and at a verizon store where the employees couldn't use it and that is when they called the first verizon engineer who turned it over to the 2nd and then the 3rd, with little help, would have sent it back but through the box and stuff away. LOOK AT THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL BEFORE YOU PURCHASE ONE."
1870,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I've had this phone for around 4 weeks and quite happy with it.  I would suggest a case for those who tend to drop your phone.  I always have because it is easier to grip, pickup, and provides a little cushion when dropping. Pictures are fine, although I would say the low light photos do suffer slightly but not a deal breaker for me.  Ran some Geekbench 5 scores and they were between 782 to734 single,  2550 to 2730 multi-core.Just changed carriers to T-Mobile and when in an urban area the 5G changes to 5G uc (Ultra Capacity) and the download was 500 to 600 mbps and upload was very good.  So far my T-Mobile experience has been excellent with this phone.  I live out in the rural areas and still get a decent signal to take care most of my common tasks on the phone.  The WIFI download was 400 to 700  mbps and upload was in a similar range depending on the traffic at the time. It is a WIFI 6 phone. WIFI test was conducted in the same room as the router.I've always been partial to the moto phones when I could get them from my carrier. Don't use a lot of the swipe options, try to keep it simple for this 82 year old mind. Love the fingerprint sensor on the power button or on the back(on an earlier Moto).  So much more accurate than  my Samsung screen sensor. Hated the Samsung because of that. If I read correctly, the ""wizards of smart"" are changing the new edge to a screen sensor. Should be fired immediately.The display is fine for my uses.  Watch some you tube, Netflix, news, and some local channels on my homerun HD app. Perhaps my standards aren't real high but no complaints here.Battery life is excellent.  I get easily a day and half or more with normal use.  When I ran a video test with Netflix, the battery ran down at about 10 to 12 percent an hour.  For me, that is just fine.Checked the signal at my house inside and outside.  I live exactly halfway between 2 towers approximately 14 miles apart.  Outside my 5G download is anywhere from 50 to 80 mbps and 15 to 25 mbps upload.  Inside 33  to 40 mbps download and 6 to 10 mbps upload. I have a brick home so signal resistance is higher.Not including this info as an endorsement of T-Mobile but to give you some indication as to the strength of the Moto Edge signal.Will update later if I think of anything of value to add."
1871,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Realice la compra del Equipo dice en las CaracterÃ­sticas que tiene ConexiÃ³n 5G pero solo se conecta en 4G nunca da el 4G, tengo otro equipo XIAOMI le cambio el SIMM Card y si se conecta en 5G y el Moto Edge 2021 no solo da el 4G con TelCel en MÃ©xico. Mi compra del Moto Edge 2021 fue motivada por la conexiÃ³n 5G que dice en la caracterÃ­sticas que si tiene, pero no se conecta no da opciÃ³n."
1872,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I like all of the features, speed, display, battery life. I returned a Motorola Edge 2022 because I hated the on-display fingerprint reader. The 2021 model has the fingerprint reader ""ON"" the on/off button. This is sooo convenient and it is quite accurate. I tried transferring apps with the supplied cable and web address supplied, but that didn't work well. At first I thought it was a phone problem. It was not. One of the apps corrupted during transfer and caused the problem. I suggest getting your apps from your Google backup, this really works the best, takes a little longer, but worth it. All in all this phone was a steal from Amazon. It came in a factory sealed box. 8GB RAM-256GB storage, 108 MPixel camera, it has it all. Was Motorola's flagship cell phone in 2021. This will be my 'forever' cell phone."
1873,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Loved the phone but could register on t-mobile network. At least that's what t-mobile told me, and since I'm not a techie, then I had to believe them. Other than that, loved the phone for the very short time I had it."
1874,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"It has no headphone jack, sd slot of dual sim. Battery life is great though the camera is good. For the brand and money, it's worth the adjustments. You can't really go wrong if the whole Bluetooth thing doesn't bother you. I would give 4/5 just because of quirks. Overall still a phenomenal phone. I now swear by moto since I got my mom one for her birthday. I've had blu's and xaiomis. This is by far competition!"
1875,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"This is my second edge, the first one got ran over by a forklift (4500 Lbs + 1000lbs of freight) pretty hefty. When I picked it up, I was expecting it to be dead, not turn on, blow up in my hand, or something along those lines. Instead I was greated by my screensaver (and heavy spider webbing from the glass but what do you expect?) And it continued to work flawlessly... Until I dropped it again... Then it did die, still one tough as nailes phone."
1876,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"This is a review after 4 days of use and I'm loving the phone. Granted, I am coming from an LGV35 running Android 8.... soooo this is a big leap forward software wise. The screen and speaker are also big upgrades. The speaker is loud and clear, the screen is beautiful and sleek, Haven't taken many pictures yet but the camera seems very capable. The design is nice, wish there were colour options tho, and I am not in love with the camera module design, but that's a pretty inconsequential gripe. Battery life seems average so far, nothing to write home about. Little features like the hand chop to turn on the flashlight and the power button double tap for a mini app drawer are useful.At 350$ this phone feels great and value rich so far. I am experiencing a little lag on twitter for some reason tho, not sure what that is about. a few spotify bugs as well but unsure if that's the phone or the app. Overall would definitely recommend at this price."
1877,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Even though I couldn't get the fingerprint reader up and going, I really love this phone!  A huge improvement over my old Moto g6, which finally died.  It seems to function more like an iPhone, but much less expensive.  Great features and fairly small learning curve if you're used to the Motorola phone."
1878,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I'm very very happy with this phone. I've had several Moto's. Other than the G7 Power that had a really bad antenna, I loved them all. Last year when I needed a new phone, I thought I would try out a Galaxy to see what all the hype was about. I HATED that phone. I gave it away, a practically new phone and bought this one.  I will never bother with any other brand again unless I have no choice.There are a lot of great things about this phone. These are the most important ones for me personally.*Fingerprint readerIt always works, even if my fingers are a little damp.It's on the side of the phone instead of the screen. So no issues with scanning my print though tempered glass.*BloatwareFacebook is installed when the phone is setting up, but you can delete it. You won't see it in ""App Updates"" in the Play Store, so it will not be reinstalled.-I also disable and remove all permissions for related FB apps in the system apps. I don't know if they have to be disabled to prevent FB from being reinstalled when you get updates.Minimal bloatware from Motorola, but they are easily disabled.Some Google apps cannot be uninstalled. They can be TRULY DISABLED. You WILL NOT see updates for them in the Play Store.There are some minor annoying apps from Moto, but they too can be disabled.*CameraYou might want to find a better app for editing. I'm not a professional photographer. For my needs, this is an awesome phone.There are only 2 things I would change about this phone.*There is no auxiliary port. I use my phone to listen to music in my car. My car has Bluetooth so I didn't think it would be a problem. The Bluetooth in my car only works for phone calls. I had to buy a Bluetooth-to-auxillary dongle. Not that big a deal, but if I knew this would be an issue, I would have bought the dongle when I bought the phone.*No storage expansion port.There is more than enough storage space on this phone. Files can be moved to the cloud, etc. I like to back everything up to an SD card that I can take out of my phone. That's no longer possible, but not a deal breaker for me.Even with the 2 things I don't like so much about this phone, I wouldn't trade it for something else. I'm very happy with it and will never try another brand again."
1879,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,I purchased a Samsung Galaxy A53 initially.  I had several issues with that phone not staying consistently connected to wifi or 5G cell.  It was also a bit slow.  I decided to try this phone instead (same price at the time).  I made the right choice.  The Edge has been very stable and very fast.  The camera and the screen are not quite as good as the A53.  But everything else is better.  And now it's quite a bit less money than the A53.  The Edge is a very easy choice if comparing the two.
1880,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"As much as like technology, I refuse to pay for an expensive phone. It can always get stolen, dropped into the toilet or left behind in a taxi or something! This one has a fast chip, 8 GB of RAM, a built in app that uses storage space as 2GB additional RAM, plenty of storage and a fairly sophisticated camera. Minus one star for the non-replaceable battery. On the other hand, in three years you can get a better one!"
1881,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"The product works well so far. However, no price match after it dropped price in two weeks."
1882,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,NICE PHONE ..I RETURNED IT BECAUSE IT CANNOT SUPPORT E SIM
1883,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,The fingerprint reader is located on the on-off switch it's extremely small and once you put a case around it you can't get at it. So if you're using fingerprint to log on to things it doesn't work. Other than that it's a fine phone.
1884,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,Do not trade you phone into Amazon. I traded mine in with a screen protector and case in a box three times it's size and packed to the gills and Amazon jiped me 18 dollars claiming I traded in a cracked phone. I called and asked for proof and now no responce. It seems well built and saved a lot rather than spending a fortune for a name. I use it a lot and charge it about once every two days.
1885,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Just to be fair, I don't use my phone for gaming, I don't watch TV on it and I rarely use it for social media.  But I do use apps like outlook for work and banking apps and also music. That being said although the phone function itself works very well, this phone is glitchy and needs to be restarted sometimes to clear out the cache from the apps that have been opened.  Outlook will just freeze.  The build quality is good though.  Camera functions work well but it's not the best in my experience so far.  To do any real editing they try to upgrade you to some google one pay app or something which is totally annoying considering there are some great free photo editing apps out there.  I considered sending this back, especially after the price dropped $50 a week later, but in the end it serves it purposes well enough."
1886,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"phone is great with exception of not being compatible with wifi calling. Apparently this is an issue because the phone is unlocked instead of affiliated with a provider. I'm no IT expert or customer service agent so I can't confirm, but sure is a missed feature."
1887,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,What I don't like about  this phone is I thought it was 5G but is not
1888,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"After a month of usage, phone holds up well. Between on-screen notifications and actual usage of 10hrs daily, the phone can last for about 1.5 to 2 days before requiring a charge. Using a 30w charger would get it fully charged is less than 40mins (I usually charge it when it drops below 30%).Had not experience any lag despite having over 130 apps on the phone. As for fingerprint reader, I personally find those physical ones to be more responsive than on-screen display ones, so this was a plus point for me.On AT&T, and 5G works for me (tested on the east coast only so far).With the right discount (30% for me), this phone is definitely a good choice. Good 5G network speed, VoLTE works well, decent speed and ram, battery that last >1 day, 30w turbofast charge (charger provided, something not as common as you'd think these days from other big brands), 256GB.It doesn't have microsd card slot, but I don't really find it a hassle with cloud options and usbc-usbc data transfer when you change phones. As for the lack of 3.5mm port, wireless buds these days last for 6hrs easily. Get 2 pairs so you will never run out of juice (charge 1 pair while using the current one).One last thing, I like the dual shake to turn on the flash light by Motorola. Something handy when your hands are ""dirty"" and you don't want to touch the screen."
1889,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Had an moto z2 for over five years figured was a great phone I'd buy another Motorola phone so bought this edge 2021, only had it a week when I dropped it not even from 2 feet and the screen is all cracked!!

1891,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I'm not a phone expert but I like it because it does what I need, and it does it we'll.  It's responsive and fast.  The screen is clear and sharp.  The battery will easily last more than a day even with a lot of use.  It charges very fast. It comes with a 30 watt wall charger. It takes nice enough pictures for me.  The speaker is at least of average loudness and clear.  It paired very easily with my Samsung Bluetooth earbuds and sounds fine.  At the time I purchased this phone I paid $350 and for that price I feel I got a good deal and made a good choice overall.  But like I said, I'm not a phone expert, just a phone user."
1892,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,Thank you so much
1893,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Pro- battery life- screen looks pretty nice-144htz and 60htz refresh rate-OS functions very well-audio enhancer feature from moto-fast processing, great loading times- great signal and coverage on most networks.- refined feeling and simple to use.Cons- CAMERA ( the camera isn't terrible and can take decent photos, but it seems to have allot of trouble focusing and it's really frustrating when taking a upclose photo or scanning a qr or bar code.- FINGER PRINT MAGNET PAINT JOB.- Notifications are effected sometimes by battery save mode more than most devices I've used.- screen doesn't hold up as well outside compared to other OLED PANELS. although for the price, I couldn't complain much about the standard LCD panel.- Moto Ready software for using ur smartphone like a desktop works but is very choppy and the phone is simply NOT READY for that kind of processing.Overall: I think this device will be more than good enough for anyone who wants a solid middle of the line priced smartphone. It's battery is my biggest plus, it's smooth, and also feels very nice in the hand. Only reason you should steer clear is if u are super into the camera software of phones and expect a nearly flawless camera experience. That's my least fav thing. I would recommend this device to friends looking to spend this amount. I would just keep this all in mind.Do I regret the purchase NO. Do I expect it to be just slightly better at this price, yes.1-10 rating from me...7.5/10Thank you for reading"
1894,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,Nice phone but missing 4 things.1. No headphone jack.2. No room for SD card.3. No wireless charging.4. Keyboard touch and hold for 2ndary text like question marks...ECT.Otherwise I love it.
1895,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,My son absolutely loves this phone
1896,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,Talk text navigation and 108 pixel camera pictures
1897,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I use this phone in Mexico for my business and everything about it has been spectacular. Functional, practical, great battery life, awesome camera, fast, and very nicely priced. I love Motorola phones!  A fraction of what other overpriced flagships cost and if itâ€™s lost or stolen Iâ€™m not gonna lose sleep over it.  Awesome everyday work phone!"
1898,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,The phone is fast and lots of storage. Very easy to install. I have not used for long enough to give a better review. So far so good.
1899,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,
1900,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I picked up the Edge 2021 to replace a Z4 and it's quite the upgrade. Lightning fast and a decent camera. It doesn't quite match up to a true flagship. But if you don't want to drop $1k on a phone, it's close enough. The Snapdragon 778 inside is competitive with last year's 865 flagship processor in many benchmarks. It drops last year's edge display, which by many accounts was somewhat annoying in actual use, so that may be a good thing. The blue back is prettier in person than in pictures.Pros: If you're a Motorola fan, all the familiar gestures are still here. The 6.8"" screen is huge. The three sensor camera is pretty high end at this price. The 144hz screen refresh rate is awesome, fast, smooth, and puts iPhones that all rock 60hz screens to shame. You get 8 gigs of operating ram and 256 for storage. You can add another 2 gigs of operating ram in the settings.  The huge 5000 mAh battery is awesome.Cons: downgrading from OLED to an LCD screen is lame (though to be fair, you'll be hard pressed to tell the difference). The lack of a headphone jack is annoying. The 144hz refresh rate is not on by default - the default is ""auto"", which maxes out at only 120hz. Contrary to what some reviews claim, this model doesn't have mmwave 5g connectivity. It does have sub 6 and C band 5g connectivity, which to be honest are the only ones most will ever connect to anyway. The back is plastic. It's a pretty, glossy, plastic that mimics glass, but it is kinda cheap at this price point. That 144hz screen refresh rate is sexy, but it eats battery quickly. Those 2 day battery life claims aren't happening with that setting. More like 1 day at best.Conclusion: if you're an Apple or Samsung fan, this phone isn't for you. It's for those who want something different than everyone else. It offers a lot for the money. It's an unlocked high-end midrange phone that approaches flagship performance for hundreds less. If that's good enough for you, then you'll love it. If you want the absolute best specs and camera, look elsewhere."
1901,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,I like that it is a little bigger in size. Battery does last a couple days.  It is very user friendly!  Tops my stupid Samsung by a mile
1902,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"This cell phone replaced a older Motorola phone. I was not expecting the speed. The discount was good and priced with cheaper phones. Comparing spec's, l got a good deal. I like this phone."
1903,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"in same price ranges. this phone can be hight recommended.  it won't be have same signal issue as chinese brand, it will working good with most U.S. operator."
1904,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"This would be my second Motorola phone.  I tried giving the Samsung A53 a shot, but I hated it compared to this one.  The Samsung's camera was a little better but other than that I like this Edge much better.  I didn't realize how much I liked the Motorola gestures (chop flashlight, flip for camera, flip over for DND), the screen is bigger (though maybe not quite as vibrant), and the power-button fingerprint scanner is great.  Yes the body is plastic but I figure that only matters if you're a person that doesn't keep your phone in a case."
1905,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,Screen has a yellow cast and not as white as my last phone. Must have something to do with eye strain. I personally don't like it. Sent it back.
1906,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"The phone has voice break-up issues during calls, especially WhatsApp calls. It also doesn't seem like the battery is that powerful.It is even already 11 days since I dropped of this item for refund and gave not heard a word about my refund."
1907,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Ok home works well, battery lasts forma day of active usage. Camera is good, but quality is not such super as top brends. Comfortable to use as writing messaging ets, software istlef works very good , nondowble screen , touchpad is fast and essential"
1908,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"This is a nice big slippery phone which you could easily lose if you don't get a case with grip very soon.  To me a phone's main job should be to make phone calls, everything else is just a bonus.  I chose a Motorola because they are one of the leaders in antenna technology.  Way back when my old Razor could make a call when no one else could.  Those days are over. This phone drop's calls on both 5g  and WIFI calling.  My son came by to show me his new phone, and next to each other on the kitchen counter his  had an excellent connection to the mesh nodes, while mine showed poor.  So, I am not surprised almost every call I make gets dropped or cuts out  Other features are okay... the phone refuses to  access the Bluetooth on my motorcycle and it takes usually 5 minutes of scrolling through options before it shows up.  It will send a text  and the new and improved 104 mp camera isn't as good as my old Pixel 4.  Let's not forget the battery life, instead of 2+ days it makes it about 12~14 hours.  If you are looking for a gift for say an ex-wife {whom you don't want to really hear from) this may be an excellent choice."
1909,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"-Update-Video play backI have gotten the ""fix"" from Motorola/Lenovo through their forums. I has fixed the the flickering issue, but there is still another issue with HDR and over saturation of colors they have not fixed yet (google it).CameraI will also call out, now that I have had more time with the phone, that the camera isn't really better than my 2020 stylus. It's just has more pixels that are blurrier and full of grain and this time they added a saturation boost. There are plenty of phones with better cameras out if that's you're selling point for the phone. Don't by the 108 megapixel hype. The same quality applies to recording videos.-Original-The Motorola Edge 2021 seemed like an amazing deal (compared to others on the market) for the introductory price (which at the time of writing this review is now over).  However, this ""Ultra-smooth 144Hz refresh rate"" HDR screen that's all over Motorola's advertising can't play back video without flickering. It's all video play back, from any streaming services down to videos recorded by the phone itself. It does it with or without adaptive brightness on, it does it at all 3 refresh rate settings... not sure how everyone at Motorola missed this during their quality control testing.Other than that, it seems like a nice phone, but in an era driven by entertainment and social presence  through media this phone currently fails to deliver in a big way. I mean if I wanted just a phone I could have got a $30 burner flip phone or stuck with my $100 2020 Motorola Stylus that can play videos (it also has better speakers) and saved a lot of money.ATM I'm waiting and hoping like many others Motorola can fix this with a software update, some people have claimed to have gotten an update that fixes it. I've not seen this update and I'm currently on the fence whether the ""fix"" is just a red herring damage control response by the company trying to buy some extra time on good faith while they try to hopefully figure it out.I'll update this review if they fix it or if I return the phone."
1910,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,Muy buen dispositovo. La bateria me dura dias. EXCELENTE!
1911,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,1. Seven hours of YouTube and battery od gone.2. My olg LG G8 with16mp camera makes far more sharper photos the Motorola 108mp camera3. Fingerprint reader is goodFor me that is a bad deal.
1912,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Bought this to replace my older model Moto G.  Works much faster.  Was hoping for better pictures, but I can't see any visible difference.  Although, camera function works faster and I have lots more memory.  Lets me keep more pictures in my phone without degrading speed.  I love the larger size."
1913,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,It was a great phone.
1914,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I really like everything about this phone, from the battery life, the speed with which it processes the orders, the image the camera, everything. No connectivity issue so far."
1915,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I have owned more Motorola phones than I have fingers and usually just buy whatever the latest phone is from Moto. I also worked for Verizon for a few years doing tech support so I know what is out there.Never again. With the Edge 2021, Motorola has fully transitioned to a brand for generic cheap Chinese phones. There are better Chinese phones that are better values now too. The only thing that differentiates the Edge 2021 is Verizon compatibility and a good vanilla Android experience.The sleek styling and premium materials of last year's edge, the z series etc is gone in favor of cheap plastic in favor of cheap gaudy plastic typical of Chinese phones these days.  Ironically, Motorola finally got the fingerprint scanner right but screwed up everything else.The phone is plastic, but still very heavy. The screen is dim, just slightly better than the z4 brightness.There is no headphone jack.The cute weather app with the slick animations of course was gone years ago.The phone migration software requires a cable connection now, and did not work  so I couldn't import my sms from my z4.You can not do any android updates on mobile data. They literally require wifi now. It is locked out.Give my regards LG and Nokia on your way out Motorola."
1916,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Love the phone, great value money, the closest equivalent is about twice this cost. But for whatever reason spectrum won't allow me to import this phone. They even sell this exact same model, which is why I bought it."
1917,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"the phone is beautiful, fast, amazing screen, but it is not compatible with Consumer Cellular service, the 5G does not work with their service and I called Motorola, and they confirmed it, it is not compatible and that was the first question I asked before buying and was told it would, everything worked but the 5G"
1918,Motorola,Edge,256 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Phone seems ok, until you update it to Android 12, then these unlocked phones have the 5G selection taken away, and motorola offering no fix. If you buy it do not update it!!! Otherwise it is a pretty good phone."

1929,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A03 Core,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,There was no issue with the battery life. The charge help up great. Face recognition and fingerprint reader were not features utilized.  One of my issue was that the phone was not recognizing my sim card and so most of my information on that card was not transmitted. Also as a result I was not able to make calls with my original number.  The issue may have stemmed from how my service was transferred by my carrier or it may have been a compatibility issue. Probabilities!

1934,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A03 Core,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,A good Device for some good general performance.The Charger Outlet came with the wrong type of Charger. It looks like Europe Outlet Charger!
1935,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A03 Core,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,This phone didn't even last three months.  Tried to take it to Samsung for warranty and since it is an international model they will not fix.  They said the motherboard needed to be repaired. $100 plus tax for a $100 phone.
1936,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A03 Core,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I bought this phone for my 85 year old grandmother and she loves it.They will never fully understand how to use smartphones, but it serves the purpose for her Church zoom meetings.The phone is responsive and has a decent battery life."

1940,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A03 Core,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"WHEN I first got the phone, I was impressed by the battery life and the speed with which this phone charged. Setup was a breeze and both my SIM cards worked internationally as they should. The screen is the perfect size. I was easily able to bring over MOST of my apps and all of my data from the old phone. (ETA) Until the phone began to give trouble. WARNING TO POTENTIAL BUYERS: When it does give problems, be prepared for major trouble. Within a month of my purchase, I moved 7 apps that were indicated could be moved to the SD card. Immediately, the device froze and went into recovery mode for 5 days. Never seen anything like it. Had to erase all the data and factory reset. Even now, it emits weird droning sounds, freezes on certain apps. You get what you pay for."

I opened the second phone and I was able to get through the setup by skipping the connecting to internet. I then connected it to wifi so I could try and download some apps. But again it was locked as soon as it was connected to the internet. I called Amazon, they forwarded me to Samsung. Samsung told me to contact the previous owner the carrier. It was that was based outside the USA. I returned the item."

1957,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A03 Core,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I bought this as a gift. The person I gave this phone to does not get consistent service, although they have a plan with T Mobile and have no problem receiving calls or texts on a different phone. Not this one. I bought the phone and I have to thank my lucky stars when my call can connect to the person I gave this phone to! They have to play around with settings to try and finesse a way to get service. Itâ€™s ridiculous! Save a little bit more money and upgrade to a better device, you wonâ€™t even be able to make calls or texts!"

The touchscreen is ultra sensitive to the point it is difficult to type with any speed without it changing from letters to symbols to numbers in the middle of the word or sentence.  I have issues with it trying to default to Samsung  apps (such as calendar) when I use a different calender app, so I get repetitive  notifications.  I remove the unwanted apps when I can and try to disconnect the others but everything the system updates the Samsung apps become the primary app."
1977,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,"I bought this A13 LTE as a replacement for my wife whose Samsung J2 that was starting to have a failure making and receiving calls (a still essential feature for us in a phone (smart or otherwise)).  My wife said to me when considering a replacement, ""I just want a phone that works"".  Pretty easy criteria for any phone, but useful to information to consider when factoring in my rating and review.She uses her smartphone primarily for calls, texting, Internet browsing, social media apps and the occasional lightweight game (like Solitaire).  She snaps pictures here and there with her phone but doesn't expect or require great quality from her phone's camera.  No surprise, this phone works great for all of those uses and she has no complaints about its performance with any of those functions - even when she ends up with five or more applications running in the background that she forgot to close.I consider this phone a great value because of the relatively low price, her satisfaction, and a few more technical reasons.  Those are:- A quality FHD display, despite not being one of Samsung's AMOLED panels- Fantastic connectivity - True Dual SIM support that includes two SIM slots AND a MicroSD slot - and unlike Samsung's could-have-been great A53 5G phone, both SIM slots work in the US.- A headphone jack.  She hardly ever uses it, but I would, and not having to have a USB-C adapter or use Bluetooth headphones is still a win in my bookThis phone is the rarest of all phones in the U.S. in terms of its connectivity, and hence I may get one myself so I can replace phones from two different carriers with one unit, even though its CPU performance is lower and size bigger than what I would like when coming from a Galaxy S7.Overall, a recommended phone if your requirements for a smartphone are similar."
1978,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,"I've had the phone out of the box for 2 minutes and the first thing I noticed is that there is no charging plug, which I realized is fairly common.More importantly, the cable is USB C to USB C only. My Motorola phone at least came with USB-A to USB-C.Luckily this phone is a gift to someone who already has a USB C charging setup, otherwise for a first-time buyer, you not only would have to buy a wall charger but a wall charger that includes USB C.Not a great big deal, but something that should be communicated to potential buyers.."
1979,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,Only issues I've had were SIM card not being detected
1980,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,The phone processor is very slow. there is always a lag in seconds and even the phone hangs often.
1981,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,"I got this phone to replace my Moto G6 thinking it would be a nice upgrade. I always had galaxy phones before the Moto with no problems. However, since the day I got this phone it has been difficult.*The touch screen response can be slow and it is so hard to type on the keyboard. It has a hard time recognizing what letters you touched and most words get spelled wrong.*I use my phone for a lot of work stuff and switching between apps frequently is important. This phone is SO slow when you're in a hurry trying to open something.*The camera takes nice pictures but it is SO slow! It takes a few seconds to capture the photo. Then, if you hold your finger too close to the capture button it acts like its going to record a video and doesn't work.I bought 3 of these phones at the same time for me and other family members. I would not recommend this phone because even though I use mine a lot, my family does not. One of them uses it mostly for reading and scrolling through Facebook and it is still slow.If you need a phone that can keep up with simple everyday use, I don't think this is what you want.Other than the phone being slow, everything else is nice.I bought this at the end of May 2022 and switched back to a Moto phone in early September 2022."
1982,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,The product arrived with out a plug.
1983,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,Budget smart phone perfect for parents and folks who are not much tech savvy. A little bit slow at times. battery life is good. And OK phone overall.
1984,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,"Bought for my daughter. I haven't done a lot of side by side comparison with a ""flagship"" phone like my S21. But so far it seems just as capable for what a typical phone should do.Using a SIM card from Visible, and it doesn't seem to do HD calling. The call clarity is fine without though."
1985,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,Great phone for the price. Although the fingerprint reader could be improved both in terms of physical placement and respose.
1986,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,"We purchased a used phone but the previous owners info keeps popping up. We had to delete his Facebook account, but weâ€™ve had trouble with Spotify. My husband (itâ€™s his phone) says the previous owners info is all over this phone. If you return a phone to Amazon that youâ€™ve used delete as much of your information as you possibly can because apparently they donâ€™t."
1987,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,1. Using T-Mobile had connectivity issues. Mobile internet works but call goes to voicemail.2. Fingerprint reader also fail 50%3. Compared to my old Samsung A20 the display wasn't good.4. Battery drains faster watching videos compared to my earlier phoneMy Samsung A20 is better than this phone
1988,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,This phone has met and exceeded my expectations.  The battery life is excellent for me.  The online part is a little slow but that may because I'm still learning how to use it.  I'm very happy with this purchase
1989,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,"Immediately out of the box my A13 LTE was super slow. Slow to load apps, slow to switch to camera (taking a photo lagged several seconds), the touch screen isn't super responsive.. just every single thing I did needed a few extra seconds of patience. Sure, I could just be patient, but with tech where it currently is I'm not going to pretend I'm in the 1990's every time I use the phone. 2GB of ram? I have hard doubts about that. Returning it after a week; I'd recommend skipping this phone."
1990,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,Probably the worst Samsung phone ive ever owned. From day one had glitches and buffering. The fingerprint sensor never works. Network coverage is sporadic at work. My older phone worked better than this one.
1991,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,This phone charges so fast and last for so long! I love it!
1992,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,it's a good enough fast phone that only needs a little more storage to be perfect.
1993,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,it's work accurately
1994,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,"Wish it came with a printed manual, but the phone is super!"
1995,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,It comes without a charger and there was no information about that anywhere.  No good
1996,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,I got a phone that looks like the one described but it was not.  Worse than the cheapest phone. It arrived very fast but it is sad I have the worst phone.  now.  I tried to reach seller. I wouldn't buy from here
1997,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,Why is this phone so god damn slow? I turned it on for the first time and i immediately noticed it already.
1998,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,Have a terrible time keeping it charged because it drains real quick and then it won't charge but for like 21 hours. That's dumb why did they sell it online when the battery was burnt. They sold me a rip off
1999,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,"This phone is the worst cell phone I have purchased since mobile phones were available: very little battery storage, screen wobbles and touch screen not responsive, a real Lemon!"
2000,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,Regular produto

2002,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,Even after a factory reset the phone lags so bad it's almost unusable. It's so slow that you can't type on the keyboard.
2003,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,"Dysfunctional,phone doesn't swipe properly. Horrible phone for 200$"
2004,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,"Somehow i ha e aquired  this hateful phone. Full of bloatware, finger reader never works. Turn assistant off weeklt but it still comes on . Cant remove the redundent samsung software that android already has. Just a pain in the ass. Ut was a bacjup till my other phibe is fixed. I will root in soon and clranse it it from its filth."

2006,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,"I was skeptical  about a phone but have been completely  satisfied.  I use this phone for work,watch videos, and browse the internet. I'm  impressed  with the  battery  and the screen."
2007,SAMSUNG,A13 LTE,32 GB,Android 12,6.6 Inches,While I would like to give a review I can not. A box.came with a charger cord and manual. I did not receive the phone.
2008,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I will be sharing with you my profound thoughts from examining this absolutely Fabulous S20 FE Samsung phone for you today....or night depending on when you read this review. I like that it's called FE. It just...... 'Feels Elegant' rolling off the tongue but what does the FE stands for? I am told it means Fan Edition. Yeeeaah, but based on my experience with the phone I think we could try something like Fun Everytime. Or Fully Enhanced. Orrr Foolish Endeavor, if you are hoping it has a 3.5mm jack. Or a Fools Errand, if you go searching for a 3.5mm jackâ€¦ even in the SIM card slot.This S20 FE had better be good, as I hear that Samsung has lost a lot of market shares to some companies like Xiaomi that had some really powerful phones which had 3.5mm jacks. Xiaomi certainly would not have followed Mango, Orange or Apple who ditch the 3.5mm jack in an effort to boost Bluetooth sales...so I hear. If it's true I do hope Samsung doesn't do that with android users cause that might not go over too well...with EVERYONE...wink wink.Now let me tell you, I have a very calm,  purring like a machine, foot loving, under my bed hiding, seemingly 3.5mm jack loving cat. Her internet name? Call her Scratchtastic. She has three jobs and she takes them very seriously. First job? Sleeping!! Second job? Eating!! Third job? Where is her 3.5mm jack at? When the Amazon box with the phone got here, I heard a strange sound. I wondered, is that growling I hear? Scratchtastic!!! What's wrong? Her look was telling me 'you better get that box outta here'. I'm like ...Crazy cat, it's got a 3.5mm jack. Duh.Folks, the phone came in a nice package and the phone lookTed really nice. Yeah and I know the word is looked. Anyhow, I set up the phone and copied my music to it. Wow!!! Let me tell you, I absolutely like the processing power of this Phone. I was sooooo excited, I was like let's get that 3.5mm jack headphone that knows how to push them beautiful sounds. Let's plug it into that 3.5mm.....where's the jack?I heard that strange sound again. Was this cat hissing again? Do you need some catnip or something? Ohh, the 3.5mm jack!! Now I knew why Scratchtastic was about to go Wolverine up in here, There is NO 3.5mm jack!!!Sad and upset at the same time, I thought Samsung, why??? Then I thought, maybe the camera will make things better. I mean, the camera is one of two main reasons why I buy a phone. The other is the 3.5 mm jack. But There is NO 3.5 mm jack!!!I tried using the zoom to see far away, but it didn't work anywhere near as good because ....There is No 3.5mm jack!!! I would have bought the overpriced S20 Ultra for the camera, but how can it take great pictures since... There is no 3.5mm jack!!!My music once sounded great on phones...& this phone sounds great & all but ...falls flat since...There is NO 3.5mm jack!!! Scratchtastic doesn't even look at me anymore....except you kno, when she needs her food. Samsung, how could you?! I couldn't test the wireless charging as Scratchtastic prefers wired charging like using a 3.5mm jack, but as we know...there is no 3.5mm jack.As a music producer, audio purity is crucial in my work. Using the 3.5mm on my phone to move music files has been essential to great audio production ...but...There is No 3.5mm jack!!! Now the music is goneâ€¦.now I'm simply called producer. Sigh!!Connecting this (unlocked) phone to the cell carrier was very simple and all worked well except I had a hard time hearing the customer service rep since the phone didn't have a .......you guessed it...a 3.5mm jack.The phone display is nice and is very smooth in motion. Can you imagine how much smoother it would have been with a 3.5mm jack?!!!And the battery?! Yeah, the size is great and last a day. But there is not a single doubt that it 'might' have lasted a whole lot longer, 'maybe' even a week if it had a 3.5mm jack.Hmmm, I hear a strange scratching sound in the kitchen like a chair is getting shredded, I better look. Scratchtastic? You awful cat!!! What you doing to the chair? Oops ...I mean sweet Scratchtastic.  I see you looking at me. Yeah I'm walking away because I wanna. Sigh, this 3.5mm jack situation is tearing us apart!!!Folks the phone calls are clear and loud and the 5G is fast.....but I feel a 3.5mm jack would have gotten it over the speed hump to 6G speeds. I didn't play any games on this phone as I'm not a Bluetooth gamer.... I'm a 3.5mm jack gamer.All in all, this is a nice phone. It's fast and has a lot going for it.Scratchtastic seems to now urinate 3.5mm closer to the floor and her urine smell has risen 3.5mm higher. So with that said here is my conclusion about getting this phone: If you have a pet Iguana, it might love you for it. But if you have a cat like Scratchtastic and you want to keep your room door open when you go to bed at night, then the absence of the 3.5mm jack can absolutely cause issues for you. Even your kitchen chairs might turn up with unknown 3.5mm deep scratches. Buy with confidence."
2009,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"SÃ­ fue lo que esperaba y estoy contento con ello, lo comprÃ© desde MÃ©xico y no hubo problema con el envio. Con algunos araÃ±azos en el marco metÃ¡lico y marcas del anterior dueÃ±o en la parte plÃ¡stica para mÃ­ valiÃ³ la pena por el costo y siendo la versiÃ³n SD 865 5g difÃ­cil de encontrar en MÃ©xico por un mejor precio. Prende como TMobile y nunca desaparecerÃ¡ su logo en el reinicio pero acepta cualquier SIM como Telcel 5g. Ya llevo un par de semanas con Ã©l y no ha tenido falla alguna, se calentaba un poco los primeros dÃ­as y ahora solo cuando juego algo pesado. Si no eres en extremo exigente es una buena compra, no es la experiencia de abrir un dispositivo nuevo de fÃ¡brica pero ofrece mucho por el costo y la neta saliÃ³ bien."
2010,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Got the phone, transferred the Sim and SD card from s9+ turned on and worked without any problems. Used Samsung Smart Switch and Google play to transfer apps and files from old phone to the new phone. Had to re-setup all the MFAs I use for work, but was expecting that. Love the in screen fingerprint scanner. Much easier to use then the back scanner I used on the S9+. It will miss from time to time, but especially at work where I have to do MFA authorizations many times throughout the day when connecting to user's computers and servers to check settings or perform remote fixes it is so much easier to press my thumb to the front of the screen than having to pull off the wireless charger to scan from the back. Battery life is great. Old S9+ could barely make it through a normal 8 hour shift and sometimes it wouldn't. The S20 FE makes it through a 12 hour extended shift with more than normal MFA with 27% battery still left. Can't really speak to the camera as if I am wanting to take good pictures I will pull out the Canon Rebel. For quick snaps of serial numbers, model numbers and things like that it works fine. Hands free is much clearer than on the S9+ as I don't get crackling or distortions on the S20 FE. A good phone for a refurbished one."
2011,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,The phone I received was in like new condition I'm very pleased with it came with the proper charger and type-c connector cable excellent condition I would recommend his phone this phone seem to be factory reset had no bloatware from any other provider very happy again with my purchase I would purchase from this seller again anytime my experience was an A+ experience so I hope that if you purchase from him you will have a great experience like I have I usually don't do reviews but I figured that this was important being what it is a great Samsung smartphone
2012,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Been using the renewed premium for 2+months now.It has dual sim card slot, but the SIM2 slot only works for micro SD card for the US version. (G781U1/US)They should fix the description about the dual sim, which is very misleading.Phone freezes a few time a month. (I set the auto restart every night)Touch screen is not as smooth as expected (set to the sensitive) not recommended for puzzle game.Otherwise this phone is great."
2013,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Bought an S21 from T-mobile last April.  Got black screen of death.  Phone has been in a case with glass screen protection.  No reason just went black.  Can't access via USB.  Went to T-mobile who's solution was to pay $799 for S22.  Still paying on the last one.  No thanks.  This phone is perfect at a fraction of the price.  Probably be back in 18 months for another one, but for the price I don't mind.  This is my 2nd Samsung that just crashed in about 18 months.  Won't ever pay full price for one of their phones again."
2014,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Overall, the phone appears to be like new and truly in excellent condition.  The only noticeable wear was some minor fading or spotting on the back plate - which, is a non-issue once you put a case on.  Of note, but also a non-issue was a very small and shallow scratch, roughly 3-4 mm, on the front of the screen which is only noticeable when holding the phone at the perfect angle, while using the RGB options of Android's hardware test.  Touch screen, battery, audio, camera, and performance all seem to be on par with a brand new phone.Packaging could use a little more cushion, there's enough movement where not only can the phone move around slightly, the box holding the phone, can move around within the box it's shipped in.It came with a cable (4~ ft. USB to USB-C, charging brick (15 W; fast charging), and SIM card removal tool."
2015,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Supposed to be an unlocked phone but has persistent nagware from Verizon that can't be removed or turned off.  I'm using this on TMobile so it's annoying.
2016,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Ok, ordered the renewed premium, I just need to add a SIM to make it my phone on the go, first thing I notice out the box is the adapter was no included, upon booting up and connecting to a network, it got stuck in an update which I had to google how to fix, luckily it worked and it stopped the cycle of restarting everytime failed update. Bixby is annoying, disable it when you get this phone. Overall good phone, will update if anythig goes wrong."
2017,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Phone listed as in ""Excellent"" condition. Paperwork in box states ""Good"" condition. I take it the difference would have been less visible signs of wear and tear on the back of phone. Phone works fine, screen looks new. Plan to encase it but still a little annoyed."
2018,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I wanted a newer phone with a better camera and I'm very happy so far. I love the frosted pink backing, the display, phone speed, and speaker/sound. The battery life seems to drain quicker than my old phone, but I'm also on it a lot. Overall very happy!"
2019,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I loved the price,however, when you buy used or renewed, it's always a gamble,food for thought."
2020,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Ordered to replace my s8 and it has amazing quality for the price, most I saw was a few spots on the back but that is to be expected from a refurbished phone"
2021,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Good phone, refurbished,  got it in like new condition,  not much came with it, instructions would have helped, took it to tmobile store to set up and transfer stuff over.So far no troubles! Have had it for two weeks now!"
2022,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,The phone is a great phone already and then to get it at a renewed price is even better!  The quality of the renewing was just right and we're really enjoying the phone.
2023,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,The phone works great fingerprint reader is very useful
2024,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I started getting notices from Sprint/TMobile that I needed to upgrade my phone to a 5G compatible phone by the end of the year. I went to the store and even though I had not upgraded my phone in 4 years there was no offers/discounts ( days of subsidizing phones really are dead but dang ). There was absolutely zero offers. Even the basic Samsung A32 was no longer offered as a free phone.I am not cheap but I am simply not willing to pay $800+ for a phone that will be outclassed in a few months.Started looking on Amazon for refurbished phone and the seller Last Of The Loot had the S20 FE for $400. Having read reviews from other buyers I knew was still rolling the die with complaints about scuff marks ( Not from that seller in particular but from refurb phone in general. I can accept cosmetic stuff since a refurb just means it functions to spec and blemishes to the case are something you can expect ), the phone being reported as stolen, the previous owner still owned money so it could not be unlocked, cracked screens, etc.I got this phone and when I opened the box it looked like it had never been used. Screen and case were pristine. It came with the owner's manual and a 15W charger. I know some people complain about that but this phone charges pretty fast and has pretty good power management so unless you are watching 4K videos all day or treating it as a portable game console the charge rate is really good IMHO. I don't have a wireless charger but am looking into it now.Phone is quite responsive in all aspects and the screen is simply gorgeous to watch videos on. Sound on the two speakers ( one at the top facing towards you and another at the bottom facing down ) is simply phenomenal. I had an HTC One when back in the day and I thought that sounded good. The difference in sound quality, volume and range of frequencies you can hear in the highs, mids and lows is like comparing $20 radio to surround sound.I have not delved into all the options in detail but I love the face unlock and fingerprint unlock options to secure your phone. Can't say too much about the camera yet since I have never been much of a picture taker but what I have seen so far it will definitely satisfy the average joe.Have used this phone as my daily driver for about 2 months now and have no had any issues whatsoever. I know that if you read some reviews and compare it to the S21 to upcoming S22 or S21 FE it will be another huge jump in performance and features but this looks like it will keep me chugging along for the next several years. If you want a newer phone but are on a budget or like me, you just find $1000+ for a phone to be ludicrous, this is good combination of price and performance."
2025,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I will wait this product will be make so good work to me ..
2026,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Have a few problems with the finger print reader other than that has been a great phone.
2027,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Hasta  ahorita  estoy muy satisfecha  con la calidad  y buen precio.
2028,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Really good so far, came with a working charging cable and very nice, crisp screen."
2029,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,So far everything is working like it should. I will add pictures and video later from old phone. After this review I am buy another one for my mother. So it must be good phone and deal for me to buy another one. Will update after having it awhile.
2030,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Excellent Product! High Quality, Durable and Lightning Fast Shipping. 5 Star.."
2031,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"The Amazon Renewed Premium is a great program and well worth the extra $40 over the ""marketplace"" renewed options. My S20 FE 5G (unlocked) was factory reconditioned by Samsung to pristine, like-new condition. Seriously, it looks brand new in every detail. All packaging and accessories were new as far as I can tell. There was no charger.I went with Renewed Premium to avoid any drama with old batteries (Samsung installs a fresh battery), old software (Samsung shipped this with Andriod 11, One UI 3.0), a less-than-pristine screen or other anomalies (read the marketplace renewed reviews). Although I think all smartphones are overpriced, I am happy with the value for money ($475).The S20 FE 5G is slightly (2 mm) taller than the LG G8 it replaced but not noticeable during use. I probably have longer than average fingers, so there's that. Would not go any bigger than this 6.5"" screen for sure.I loved the LG G8 but along with abandoning the smartphone market, LG have also apparently abandoned their promise of security updates. As a result, I allowed the Borg to assimilate me and went with Samsung on the promise of 4 years of updates for the S20 FE 5G. I've already gotten 3 updates over the past three weeks. We'll see how that goes over the next few years but it's a promising start. Way better than LG ever was...I do not really miss the quad HD screen from the LG G8 (maybe a little). The S20 FE screen is gorgeous and sharp. This is my first 120 hz screen and I'm hooked. ""Buttery smooth"" is not an exaggeration. I do miss the headphone jack but the Bluetooth implementation on the S20 FE is better than the LG G8 and music detail is excellent on my Bose Quiet Comfort II.The phone came with the usual bloatware. I used Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to get rid of all the preloaded BS (just Google it, easy-peasy). The phone is lighting fast for everything I do. I'm not a big gamer, but I have been playing Genshin Impact on the S20 FE with high settings and zero problems. No lag, no stutter.Some reviewers have complained about the optical finger print reader. Others like it. I have had zero problems with it. Works great. Not as fast as the capacitive button on the back of the LG G8 (a better place for it IMHO) but this one works just fine. Face unlock is even faster, if that's your jam.The cameras are good also but the camera bump is ridiculous. A case is a must just so it can sit flat on a table. I got the TORRAS case. Nice and thin with adequate protection.Bottom line: S20 FE 5G is excellent. Amazon Renewed Premium is excellent. Highly recommended."
2032,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,It great and very light I love the quality
2033,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,The phone seems to be in excellent condition.  The screen showed no wear.  The battery has excellent life.  With the light use that I put it through I can go more than a day with out recharging.  My only real complaint with the phone itself is the lack of a 3.5 mm jack.  I wish they'd keep the jack.I should probably note that I picked the S20 FE over the S21 FE because it comes with a micro sd slot.
2034,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"It dosent stay charged longer then 15 hrs and less depending on my use of it. Sometimes the screen won't except taps or swipes, the cursor is toooo sensitive.. it is difficult to turn it off to restart it.."
2035,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Phone arrived in excellent condition and arrived quicker than expected! No issues at all so far. I'm very pleased with my purchase.
2036,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Turned in for a $800 value with at&t
2037,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Value for money
2038,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,
2039,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Awesome phone and great futuresâ€¦..
2040,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Received an unlocked as advertised. The phone had no bloatwear or carrier affiliation. Came in perfect condition with no noticeable cosmetic flaws. Arrived several days before the predicted time frame. Am very satisfied with the phone!
2041,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"First Off I want to say The phone was perfect no issues out of the Box. Came with a 50% charge and transferred all my old Phones Data Flawlessly. Use a Cable it seemed faster. I was excited to use it BUT, There was an issue Not with the Phone With ATT First Net.So here's the Problem: apparently with Att getting rid of their 3g network I am no longer able to use my phone while connected to LTE and I have to be on a 3g network to make and receive calls. I have talked to customer service and all they where able to do is have me download an app that helps me do this. I have gone into a physical store and received some help from them, but as it turns out UNLOCKED PHONES WILL NOT WORK on FirstNet's network due to a programming issue. So I HAD to purchase a Phone from ATT to be able to make calls on the LTE/5G network."
2042,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I needed a better phone upgrade but couldn't afford the regular price of this phone, for the price I see nothing wrong with the phone and it's working great."
2043,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,its refurbished but can't tell at all 100% happy.
2044,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,The phone itself seems to be fine except for a few glitches. The voice texting is not great and it has a tendency to add extra words that I don't even say.. Sometimes I have to tap the keypad twice to get the letters to show up. It's nothing serious but I always have to edit my voice texting and that kind of takes the purpose away from voice texting in the 1st place. It's a good looking phone and I'm sure for the price it will serve its purpose but I kind of wish I had done differently and just ordered a little bit more expensive phone. Or maybe not a renewed one
2045,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Phone worked for 1 day.  On PATRIOT MOBILE, tons of problems. Went to Cricket- switched services. (Which I absolutely should not have to do!)  Wouldn't connect or work at all for over an hour, while in the Cricket store.  Left to get internet and drive the block.  Got connected to restaurant wifi.  Then slowly Cricket uploads started working.  20 min of resetting, the service is still in and out.  We used a T-mobile sim card and it fired up immediately.  On 2 phones we just purchased.  But nothing on Patriot Mobile sim card, nor the Cricket sim cards, would work.At this moment it is very clear that the phones are NOT unlocked!The ""unlocked"" phones we purchased here, are **NOT** unlocked!Edit: according to the model#, we did receive unlocked phones. Unfortunately Amazon sent us sm-781u1/ds which is a Canadian dual Sim model number... NOT SUPPORTED BY ATT.Even though we were sent the incorrect model# Amazon would not replace our phones. Forcing us to purchase 2 new phones (hoping they're fulfilled correctly this time) AND THEN returning the old ones. Unacceptable, Amazon."
2046,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Everything thing was perfect.  Not any scratches, like new.  No problems so far.  Am happy...."
2047,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Now that I've had phone for a few months a fair review is possible. Looked new when received but once a case was added, no one would know. Some issues with volume on some programs and speaker on phone. Phone resolved with restart.  Still have inconsistent issues but not so much as to want me to pay twice as much for new vs. refurbished."
2048,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"This is an update to my comments from January 15th on the seller's (bayshine trading) comments section.Now that I have been using the phone for about a month I can say that the seller went BEYOND his responsibilities in his description of the phone, the packaging he provided, his ship speed, and the inclusions of all of the stated peripherals. As I said in my initial post, his answers to my my presale questions were accurate, honest and quickly responded. When the opportunity to recommend bayshine trading I will happily do so and will no doubt being doing business with them in the future.As for the phone, it is all I expected. Great refresh specs make for an ultra smooth experience. The screen quality is a nice step up from my MOTO Edge however I did adjust the white balance and RGB settings from the default settings a tad to suit my taste. TMO's 5G network plays well with the S20 FE. I routinely experience 120 mb download speeds inside my house. In full disclosure I got about the same performance from my Edge (NOT the Edge plus) which tells me that even though I traded up a bit regarding the Snapdragon processor, that upgrade hasn't seem to have had an affect on my download speeds. As a side note, I believe the MOTO Edge is an excellent phone and proved to be a great value as long as you're not paying list for the unit. (I paid $499 and list WAS $699) I did tire of the edge-to-edge display but that is a personal taste. Also, I didn't have any of the well documented screen problems that many of the units have had.Still, the S20 FE is an upgrade to the Edge in several areas: processor, display, refresh and form factor (again, a personal taste). My Edge had more native memory (256 gb vs 128 gb) but both can close (or increase) that gap with an sd card. The Edge was nearly a pure Android experience and the S20 FE comes loaded with mucho Samsung apps and bloats. I kept some, deleted some, ignored some but this common complaint about Samsung is true - all with workable work-arounds but true.So, inconclusion if you have a $500 cell phone budget and don't mind buying a year-old model, it's hard to go wrong with this reconditioned option. Coupling the phone with a resell vendor like bayshore trading only sweetens the deal.Buy with confidence."
2049,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I need to say that while the phone is supposed to be 100% unlocked (NO carriers attached to it at all), mine definitely has the T-Mobile boot-up screen when it turn it on. Under the networks/'Access Point Names', the listed one is 'T-Mobile US LTE'. When I completed a software update just now, the message that popped up when it was done read: 'Software update completed. Thank you for using T-Mobile'.Now, I'm not a hugely technical person - I don't know if that's because my no-contract carrier (US Mobile) also uses the T-Mobile network (for the SIM card I use - US Mobile allows you to use either the T-Mobile or the Verizon network, they give you a choice of two different SIM cards)... but before I'd even put my SIM card in this phone, I was still seeing the T-Mobile boot-up screen, so who knows.At ANY rate, I can't speak to someone who will want this phone for the Verizon network (or equivalent). Maybe it will work just fine, I don't know. For ME, who happens to be on the T-Mobile network ANYWAY, it works fine.The signal is much better than my older, previous Samsung A-series phone. No more missed calls, dropped calls, delayed texts, etc. It arrived in very good condition (a few TINY scuffs that I barely noticed on the back, but they were almost invisible), the price was good (it's crazy how much unlocked phones normally cost nowadays), the screen looks great, my apps all work great - overall, if you're debating getting this phone (especially since it's renewed/refurbished), definitely go for it. I love it!  :-D"
2050,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I should've done more research when buying the phone. I was expecting something as high as 5000mah like an older model like the A12, but it was only 4500mah. I was disappointed on that but everything else is great."
2051,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I have been using Samsung phones for years. They are super little phones that are durable and easy to use. I went from a 9 to 20fe and it kept all the things I liked while adding features that made my phone more responsive than ever before.  SUPER SWEET.
2052,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Great picture and battery life phone is also super fast
2053,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I am not a power cell phone user. Being an old fogey, my main use for a cell phone in the past has been to use to make phone calls and send and recieve text messages. I purchased this phone mainly to use as a camera, at the recommendation of a friend who had one. I also made sure though to check with my service provider that I would be able to use it as a phone.This phone is already proving to be worth it for me, if only for the camera! It is sooooo much better than what I had before, and I'm sure it will also prove very useful for other things as well. I am already delighted with my purchase!!"
2054,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I have been looking every where for this phone in this color. I am so happy that I found it here on Amazon. The price was a steal.
2055,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Phone arrived in great working order - clean, responsive, and great battery life.UNFORTUNATELY, like some other critical reviews have noted, it is NOT fully unlocked.Took me several days to get my full service to function (could use data/mms but no calls), which would be hard to accomplish for those without some tech savviness:This phone said it was tied to Sprint in the settings and had an ODADM pop up that kept trying to activate with sprint/tmobile network service and failing (a common problem for supposedly unlocked sprint phones).After a 3rd attempt with Sprint customer service, I had a dedicated agent dig deep into the IMEI on the back end and see that it was actually only tied to Verizon(?). So I got a verizon compatible SIM for my Straight Talk and after 45 minutes with their outsourced customer service, managed to get full service.The sprint-based OMADM persisted in trying to register with their network until I used a little code via ADB to clear it out. Now the phone works great, but I was close to sending the phone back and would expect many others would have given up and done the same."
2056,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Fast shipping and the phone looks and feels brand new! Thank you!
2057,SAMSUNG,Galazy S20 FE,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I give 4 stars because takes 11 days to delivery after I ordered. The phone itself is not bad but not very good has a few small signs of wear, seems to be work good for now. Also they include a cheap generic charger not even an OEM."
2058,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,the phone covers my needs however the camera is pretty basic .
2059,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,Muy buen telÃ©fono cumple perfectamente con todas sus funciones lo Ãºnico que puedo decir en que si quieres guardar fotos y videos debes poner una tarjeta de memoria para tener mÃ¡s almacenamiento...pero lo demÃ¡s perfecto ğŸ‘Œ
2060,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,Battery life is not the greatest but it does manage to last the whole day.The outside was in perfect state. No complaints
2061,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,Everything arrived on time. I uploaded my contacts everything works great
2062,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"I purchased this phone for my child. It's light weight,  good battery life.The screen is a good size.  So far it's a great phone.  Definitely worth the price!"
2063,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"Good price , I use this cel  when I travel overseas so I dont fear losing a more valuable one.This phone allows me to do all my needs outside of the U.S.A."
2064,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,It is great .I used it for my work
2065,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,I like it.
2066,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"Perfect condition, using it with Mint.....works GREAT!  Specs indicate G2 which will be dead after Jan 2023.  Not true in this case.  This cell phone is LTE+ which is G4!  Great price!"
2067,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,I love the size of the phome
2068,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,wasn't compatable with my service
2069,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"I have a work phone, so I don't need it to make calls.  I wanted a device to use for personal things, like listening to audiobooks and music, monitoring my heart rate while I jog, recording my food, medicine dosages, private messages to friends and family, photos, etc.  It does all of these things perfectly.  The battery life is excellent and it has not crashed or given me any kind of problems since I received it.  Glad I have it.  It fits the exact hole in my life I bought it to fill."
2070,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,The battery is good as well
2071,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,The A10e is a decent Android phone with good battery and features.
2072,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,Everything itâ€™s good
2073,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,Muy bueno
2074,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"i know this was refurbished, but the battery has a low battery life, can't last 10 hours. And the outer screen has three smudge lines top to bottom that cant clean up, this was way over priced for the model,( i didnt do my research), you can get this from certain companies for less than $40 bucks."
2075,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"I cant really give a review of the actual phone since i didnt see this purchase in person myself, but I can comment on the condition since it was renewed. The person i bought this for said that the phone was in poor condition and didnt come with the charger as was specified as included at the time of purchase. Trust me, this isnt someone that would expect a new S21 Ultra for $100, they are very reasonable and didnt expect to be blown out of the water, so the depth of their disappointment was very telling. Luckily there was some sort of trade in promo that their local ATT was running and so they ended up trading this in the next day without even wasting time trying to live with it and got a new phone for a couple bucks."
2076,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,So far so good.  Lets see how it keeps up
2077,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,My boyfriend goes through phones like they are going oiut of style because he is just so clumsy and such that I wanted to get him something that would work well for his needs but also something that wasn't super expensive so that if it was broken like all the rest it wouldn't break the bank. I love Samsung phones so I was happy to come across this one. It was pre-used but there aren't any scratches or anything major with it. They also included a charging cable because it takes a Type C as well as a USB adapter wall plug. They also put in a paper that tells you about the unlocked phone and how to get it to use other carriers chip (I forget what they are called). The only thing I wasn't really happy was that I am pretty sure that it advertised the phone as black and so I bought a black and clear case to go with it however when I got the phone it was actually blue. My boyfriend doesn't care though so we kept it. Other than that pretty happy with it.
2078,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"My son ordered this phone to be used with an AT&T SIM card and was told he needed to have a ""broken"" or unlocked phone.  When he got out to Arizona and was given his SIM card the phone only came up with the Verizon logo and wouldn't accept the ATT SIM Card.  I called the seller who told me ATT changed their policy a few months ago and that is why. They also said they would take the phone back.  I called Amazon and it is easier to pay the $25 restocking fee from them and just stick with Amazon.  Still feel like it was good customer service from both parties."
2079,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,
2080,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"This is a renewed phone  purchased 12/3/22.  I needed it to do one thing..  Run the the cardiac app. It did not have a Sim card until around May. 1.Once it was put into service,. it was slow and had poor tactile response... The phone quality was garbled.I wrote the seller. He stood behind his 90 day warranty and that was that.. I have never purchased a rebuilt product until now."
2081,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"The phone is probably a decent budget phone when it's new. I bought this as a replacement for a much better but also much older phone for a teenager.2 stars because, even for a budget phone, it felt super cheap. Now, I suspect this was most likely due to it being a renewed product. Most often I think refurb phones are OK. In this case though I think whoever fixed up this phone used cheap replacements and did a bad job of it because oem parts would cost almost as much as the phone!. From day one  the phone was nearly unusable due to constant phantom touches all over the screen that would hang up calls, switch between or close apps, and cause the screen to get stuck alternating between the two home screens, like someone frantically swiping left and right on the home screen. Anyway, as I mentioned the phone screen also felt super cheap and it even started to separate along the top edge. Within a couple days the screen also started to crack and what little glue was holding on the screen must have given up because the whole screen (glass, digitizer and lcd) just fell right off. I'm sure this was the exception to the rule but just be aware you stand a better chance of getting a lemon on a refurb/renewed phone.  Better to buy refurb flagship phones. You can get a decent new budget phone for slightly more than this renewed budget phone.Moto G anyone?"
2082,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"It was never specified that the cell phone did not come with a charger, so on top of the price, I had to order a charger for an extra $20."
2083,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,Everything
2084,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"It is a great device for kids, and as spare. Does everything you expect from an entry level phone, it is not super fast but if you pay so little for a phone, you already know you won't be getting a flagship.Screen is clear, battery last quite a long time, and overall it is responsive. Do one thing at time with it and it will comply with your requests"
2085,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"My old phone, also a Samsung A10e, went thru the washing machine and I wanted a replacement for it, because I liked the phone so much.  It is not made anymore, but Amazon had this replacement, and it looks and works as if it was brand new.  Easy transition of the old chip to the new phone.  Highly recommend."
2086,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,The phone came on time as expected and it's works well for the most part. I only bought this phone for my side hustle phone instead of my main phone. You get what you pay for
2087,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,Got it
2088,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,The first phone had hearing issues. I returned  the product. The replacement  was sent in a timely  fashion and works great. This company did a great job with keeping me happy. I will buy from them I. The future.
2089,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"This phone is ok...This phone lacks some basic features on most modern phones, no finger print reader, wich I miss more then I expected. The face reader sucks in low light, and is a bummer in the era of masks in public.It has fewer personalization options, and some not so intuitive settings controls.That being said... the battery is good, the smaller size is convenient, the micro USB is great for tons of extra memory, and it is a functional telephone."
2090,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,I bought as a gift I still canâ€™t make a final judgment about the battery  . As of the value of the money.  After i ordered it I found the same one 12 dollars cheaper ..
2091,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,Just what I needed.
2092,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"Couldn't use phone. It was supposed to be unlocked, but couldn't make or receive calls with it."
2093,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,If this thing was refurbished you would never know it. It looks brand spanking new. Only thing is that it's gray not black. But that's okay because I prefer the gray. Put SIM card and start it up and everything started downloading automatically. The phone works wonderful and I'm very happy and highly recommended.
2094,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,When trying to charge the device it shows a warning message and is not charging at all.I think the battery has issues. Not happy and planning to return.
2095,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,It's a good phone for the money it works great
2096,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"Great product but did not last for more than 1 and 1/2 years, battery issues speaker issues and more. Its like the phone does not last for 1yr.now"
2097,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"If you are looking for a phone for everyday use, i.e. calling, texting, playing games, etc. you would be insane to use this piece of junk. If you are looking for a cheap phone to test apps on as a developer, you are SOL if you choose this hunk of glorified plastic. Better off with an unlocked A03s. My suggestion would be to never buy a phone for under $100 in general but I get it. Save a little more dough and go with a phone in the $150-200 range at least."
2098,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,phone was in excellent condition
2099,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"Iâ€™m so upset! The person who sells the phones are false advertising and itâ€™s sickening. First the phone is suppose to be unlocked and it isnâ€™t. Second my sims card is not supported with the phone, and also the battery life suuuuucks!! Phone went from 32% to 3 in the matter of seconds!! Will be seaking a refund asap !!"
2100,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"Phone is in excellent condition. Overall very happy with purchase. No instructions and the phone came outside the box, which was open and seemed to have been thrown in with the phone."
2101,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"I like how they look, but I donâ€™t like the fact that one of the charger is missing."
2102,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"I bought this phone solely because I needed to replace my previous broken phone. I didn't need anything fancy. Just something that was cheap, but similar to what I'm used to. For about $100 the only complaint I have is the camera is pretty crappy. Other than that I was able sync my data over to this phone really easily."
2103,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"Item arrived earlier than expected. Others have noted scratches or other damage. This reconditioned phone was impossible to tell from brand new. Activating through MetroPCS took a simple phone call. Porting everything over from my old phone took all of ten minutes. It is a little smaller than my wife's A20 but that doesn't bother me as it fits in my pocket better. The only complaint is that without a case this phone is very slippery. Also, I would like a longer charging cord. I would definitely recommend buying an aftermarket case along with the phone. Nice phone at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend."
2104,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,No es desbloqueado
2105,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"The phone was good but the compatibility was not. I had no problems getting started, the data side with the wifi was ok but the phone app would not work with my network. I had to get a better phone to work with my 4g network phone app. Sim cards didn't work well with it either."
2106,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"Purchased for an extra phone line, works great."
2107,SAMSUNG,A10e,32 GB,Android 9.0,5.83 Inches,"I wasted money on this phone, I can't use my sim card that I've been using for a long time in many different phones, but this phone was falsely advertised and did not say anything about incompatibility with networks. I don't have a working phone at all now, and my boss is trying to buy me a burner phone. How pathetic."
2108,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,THE PHONE does not have all parts to work in  my country  bumed  because  great phone?
2109,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"It has a problem with turning of the mic after the first word when you start to do speech to text. From reading online, this may be a problem with Samsung phones in general. I tried clearing the cache partition as indicated in one post, but the problem has not gone away. This could be a pretty nice phone if Samsung would fix this problem."
2110,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"According to Mints site, the A12 was comparable in my area. BUT, once I got the phone, and put in my new SIM card it did not work. Called Mint customer service, and they had me pull up some IMIE number and then was told that ""Oh, that is an old software that Mint no longer supports, SORRY!!""I loved the phone, but Mint messed it up.Probably should have stuck with Verizon."
2111,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"A good phone, great features, easy to use, budget friendly, amazing battery life, everything I wanted and needed.HOWEVER.I bought this phone because reviews and the mint employee I spoke to said it was compatible with Mint mobile carrier service.THIS PHONE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MINT MOBILE. DO NOT BUY IT IF YOU ARE WITH MINT. I have not had more than one bar since I got this phone, which is 100% on my service provider and not on the phone itself. After being on the phone for an hour with MINT, we finally figured out that the first employee I spoke to had either made a mistake or flat out lied to me.Great phone, sad to have to return it."
2112,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"I am at a lost, one of the package was damaged, however nothing seemed tp be out of place. Later i realize it was charging slower than the other. In less than 2 months of using it stopped charging all together. I am so disappointed. I dont what to do at this point."
2113,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"I bought this phone a week ago for my teenager and wasn't sure what to expect based on reviews but a brand new phone arrived in a small box (that clearly fit the phone) with a charger and headphones; it also works fine with mint mobile.  I need a temp phone for a few months so decided to buy this exact same phone from the exact same seller (as in clicked on buy again button) and it arrived today in a huge box wrapped in bubble wrap in a plastic wrap with the bubble wrapping things on top with a card saying this phone was not compatible with certain carriers.  The box was sealed but it was clear it was not a new phone and it did not have the headphones or the plastic cover on the phone itself and it has an international charger with an adapter which is fine based on the title of international unlocked phone but the other phone did not come with it so I am returning this phone hoping the next phone sent is similar to the first one.  Not sure what happened but maybe it's just depends on the day, IDK, will update when the new phone arrives"
2114,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,This is a perfect phone for your young teenager to begin their venture into th editorial realm.
2115,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,Good
2116,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,It works great!
2117,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"I liked my old samsung galaxy J 3  model.  But this model is no longer serviceable under FCC rules so I had to upgrade to something.  I picked the A12 samung Galaxy phone as a reasonably priced upgrade.  I am still learning how to use it though.  But I hated the way the Motorola Power G phone worked so I returned it Target and bought the new samsung on amazon.  So far its working fine even though it is an ""international phone"" whatever that means.  The google maps lady giving me directions when I drive someplace has an English accent.  LOL."
2118,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,Recomendado
2119,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"I really like this phone! Works just as well as any other Samsung. If anything, it may have too many features! XDAnd it's truly unlocked because I was able to insert my Mint Mobile card in the phone and use the service with no issues.The only real complaint I have is with WiFi connectivity. It can only connect to a 2.5G wifi connection. Anything above that and you will not be able to connect to wifi.The phone also roams a lot at the slightest  loss of a network signal and constantly reverts to showing the ""E"" next to the signal. I then have to turn Airplane Mode on and off to get the signal back. It's a small annoyance but worth it as far as the phone's price.Overall, good buy! Very happy with my purchase!!ğŸ‘ğŸ¾ğŸ‘ğŸ¾ğŸ‘ğŸ¾ğŸ‘ğŸ¾ğŸ‘ğŸ¾"
2120,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,I like it I buy it for my nephew I hope he like it went I sent it for him in the island
2121,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,Not compatable with my network
2122,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,This phone worked okay at first but when the phone did update it did not want to work with my cellphone Carrier cricket wireless.
2123,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"The phone I received was still locked, so I returned it.  This phone is available cheaper (and actually unlocked) on Back Market.The Samsung A12 is still awesome as a phone, but Amazon was not the right place to buy it."
2124,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,Lo mande a mi paÃ­s y les gusto
2125,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,I just buy this phone for a gift look new  I inserted a sim card and made a first excellent phone call. Will buy it again. So far excellent experience not like  crazy CELLULAR GALLERY experience.
2126,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"The phone was at a great price and it shipped within hours. The cosmetics are sleek, it is just the right size and weight. I wouldn't buy this without a screen protector and case.***The display screen is dull compared to an earlier model. Colors are less vibrant. The touch movement speed is much slower than an old A10 32gb it was supposed to replace... The charging jack is loose. It is possible that this is just a factory defect, I would hope it is not a refurbished product in new packaging.^For these reasons I will be returning for replacement in hopes the next one is in much greater health."
2127,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"This is a beautiful phone that lives up to most of the product the description. However, I went to register it with Samsung, for the warranty, and the model is not warrantied in the U.S., since it is made abroad :(  I also found out the hard way, that it is only 2G and 3G and that my existing AT&T SIM did not work. Upon contacting AT&T to troubleshoot, they confirmed that this model did not support 4G and 5G and they are in the process of shutting down their 2G & 3G networks.  Too bad because I really love this phone - especially the dual SIM. I hope this review helps others to not make the same mistake."
2128,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"I bought this phone to replace another Galaxy A12 that I got from a cellular shop in the states after its screen cracked.  I can say that the battery on the new phone doesnâ€™t last nearly as long as the battery on the old phone did after a charge, and that seems odd to me.  Also this latin American version is supposed to be good with two sim cards in it, but when I went to Colombia recently I couldnâ€™t get it to work with a local line, and that was lame."
2129,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"We bought this phone for our granddaughter for her birthday, relying on the fact that the description stated it would work with all carriers. It does NOT.  After 2.5 hours spent in AT&T locaton, it was decided that we would have to buy one of their phones, of course, at a higher price.  Our grandaughter still got her phone but at a waste of time and trouble fo all of us."
2130,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"Firt the plug for the charger is EUROPEAN,  second,  it gets very hot when charging (bought a original Samsung galaxy charger and still gets hot, am afraid is gonna explode!!!! Don't buy that crap...."
2131,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"Phone only worked for 3 months, then started losing connectivity to data and Wi-Fi, so I tried to register for warranty to get it fixed and I found out there's NO US warranty on this international model. After a bunch of hassle I did get support from Samsung international. Probably best to avoid them."
2132,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"I received this phone yesterday,it was unlocked was able to use two SIM's immediately. The set up was easy. I'm currently living in the Caribbean. It works with our local networks."
2133,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,I feel it is too expensive for what you get out of it but it is in line with the pricing of other unit similar in size capabilities and memory.  I found it extremely puzzling that the phone did not have Smart View auto installed in the unit.
2134,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,It works great in Cuba.
2135,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,Me agrado la mochila que compre

2139,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"Works for Panama too, was a gift for my father, and heâ€™a delighted with it!!!"
2140,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"The cellphone came in a timely manner, packaged properly , new condition but when I opened the package the charging plug was from another country possibly the UK, other than that everything was great ."
2141,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,Great value and workmanship!
2142,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,It was in perfect condition
2143,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"Contrary to their description, this phone would not work with Consumer Cellular.They (or Amazon) did accept a return and refund, but it cost me a few days without a phone."
2144,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"Firstly, this phone is set up for use in Europe. The plug for the charger is European, as it the setup and weather app. I cannot get the phone to accept setting changes to correct this. This phone will not screenshot and often does not download texts, especially pictures and group texts. Group texts often get separated and will not download. I have tried changing settings for that, also.  It automatically corrects itself, then will change back again at a later date. The phone also WILL NOT connect to wifi most times.These are NOT carrier problems, as other members of the family have the same carrier and wifi and do not have this problem.  All in all, this is the worst phone I have ever owned, which is sad because it was a gift from my husband."
2145,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,from USA this is a great price for an unlocked A12 Samsung. Works great!
2146,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,Itâ€™s a nice and affordable cellphone
2147,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"Overall,  compared the price of the phone, its good."
2148,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,Excelente equipo
2149,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,Sirve muy bien
2150,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,I found out that this phone is not compatible with my phone service which is Boost Mobile. Also the charger isn't even American and the adapter that was sent with it doesn't work either.
2151,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"Yes, this phone is unlocked but Verizon, Totalwireless, and Mint said it wasn't compatible to their systems. The chargers were apparently European and useless in the U.S. Very disappointing, but I was able to return it at no charge thanks to Amazon's return policy. I was really counting on this phone to work out for me since it was designated ""Amazon's Choice.""  It may be a good phone for Europe, South and Central America, but I learned the 'unlocked' designation does not mean it will work well in the U.S. Unfortunately, you don't know until you get a phone in hand so you can access the IMEI number to verify it with. Disappointed!"
2152,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,"I've been trying to use the phone with Verizon, which has been my carrier for years!I've tried several times to connect device and been told that device is not compatible with them.I missed the return window, because i was hoping that this would change with time.....DO NOT BUY!"
2153,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,SegÃºn la persona estÃ¡ trabajando perfectamente.
2154,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,Utter trash and this would be insulting trash. From the first day I should have sent it back. I got glimpses of maybe its okay so I held on to it. Now I'm stuck with this piece of trash that used toilet paper is better than
2155,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,Phone is not unlocked. Phone is black listed or stolen according to AT&T. Update now scamazon has not received the phone back (lost in the mail) now I'm out 200 bucks!
2156,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,This phone doesn't ever have service while driving so i cant listen to spotify or pandora like i used to every single day with my old phone with the same service. It also does not recive group texts as group texts it receives them all individually from the people even tho it sends group texts fine but it makes responding to or just basically following a conversation incredibly difficult. Overall very disappointed would not recommend
2157,SAMSUNG,GALAXY A12,64 GB,Android 11,6.5 Inches,I did not read before getting this phone. Shipped it overseas and it does not work over there. Fist time i have this problem with an unlock cell phoneNot a good purchase this time :(
2158,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"So far, the phone does seem to be easy to use. It is definitely not as complicated as an I-Phone."
2159,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"This is my first smart phone (having owned a simple flip phone for years), and so I wanted something simple-to-use and not too expensive.  The monthly fee is not cheap but not expensive either.  It's very easy to set up and extremely easy if you don't keep your old phone number.  If you keep your previous number, it will take much longer to activate.  I chose a new random number, and it was working within an hour.  I highly recommend this item to anyone who wants a phone that is easy to use and that won't put too much strain on your finances."
2160,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"so far , I'm very happy with my purchase..I learn more & more a bout the phone as days goes by. No disapointment here @ all."
2161,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,This was a gift for my grandmother. She kept eyeing my phone. And ironically her 10+ yr old FLIP phone stopped working. She had seen an add for a cellular starting to be suitable for seniors so we investigated and and I got her the Jitterbug and a pretty case. She really thinks she's hot stuff now even though she still can't work it! But she looks awfully cute with it!
2162,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,Very poor view during daylight hours
2163,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"My 23 year old developmentally delayed son has a hard time with phones with a number pad but this phone is perfect for him.  He loves it.  Also, when I called into Lively to activate the phone the staff were great and explained everything to me."
2164,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"I have been looking at smart phones for a number of years and bought a ""pay as you go"" one a couple of yeas ago; however, it was very difficult to use - I only used it for emergencies while traveling.  I am computer capable, but it was beyond me for easy use.  And it was difficult to connect to a service as we live in a very rural area.I researched and found the Jitterbug smart phone - So easy to use.  It is also very easy to see - large numbers and simple design for finding what I need.  It also connects easily to area networks and my computer system.It is still a backup only for travel; however, if I were to carry a cell phone with me daily, I would choose this one."
2165,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"Only a couple of drawbacks:  I can't speak a text message and see it in printed form - only an actual voice message; Two, the camera on this phone isn't as clear and good as I'd like it to be.  Third, I receive over a hundred texts a day from Lively to sign up for the emergency service number.  That is a nuisance - even though in an e-mail I told them to stop that chronic message."
2166,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,Absolutely love this smartphone. Bought this phone for my older sister when her phone died. She wanted something easier to use. This was perfect. Love it so much that when my iPhone needs replaced I will get one for myself! This phone has everything I need without a screen full of needless icons/apps. As far as Iâ€™m concerned ( and also my sister) the Jitterbug Smartphone is The Best!
2167,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"I bought this phone for my husband, who has Alzheimer's Disease, because I thought it would be really simple for him to work. (he previously had a flip phone.) To be honest, even I occasionally have trouble with it. I have an iphone. When it updates, it throws the whole phone off, and I have had to call support to help reset the apps so he can even use it. If this happens when he's alone, he won't be able to work it. He's not capable of calling to get help resetting it so it works again. That kind of defeats the purpose of him having this (simple) phone.It was a pain to port his old number, and took 3 days. They assigned him a new number in the meantime, but he's not able to learn new numbers, so if someone asked him for his phone number before his old number got ported, he had to say ""I don't know,"" or ask me if I was there.I'm not sure whether I would buy this again."
2168,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"Never wanted the expense of a smart phone nor having electronic attached to my hand; however, getting older, I got this for future possibilities and necessity.  Absolutely love this phone, ease of use, ease of getting support, low cost.  Also ordered one for my husband and an older friend.  We are all very satisfied."
2169,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,I like it is lighter than most smart phones.  Tech support is good so far.  It helps that I already have experience on computers and tablets. Makes navigating easier.
2170,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,I found this phone easy to use (if a little slow) and have been exceedingly happy to have it.
2171,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,Like the phone not as easy as advertised to learn
2172,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,...my mom still can't figure out how to send a text.
2173,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,2nd phone
2174,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"I bought this for my senior friend. It is much easier for her to use than her Samsung Galaxy, but it is a change so can be a challenge for her at times, but the customer service is over the top excellent! They have helped us several times already. Each person was patient, knowledgeable, and friendly."
2175,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,So far everything is going good.
2176,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"This is supposed to be easy to use.  Yes, there are many other bad reviews, but somehow I was hopeful and tried it anyway.  It's my third cell phone, and the only one that I may have to return or throw into the trash.  First of all, to set it up, you're supposed to call a certain phone number.  But when you dial that number, all you get is a recording that says the number is out of service.  Then, somewhere in the instruction booklet, I found a second phone number, but that number gave the same result as the first one.  So I called their Customer Service.  That person managed, after about an hour, and with some difficulty, to connect me to a ""set-up specialist"" with whom I spent two or three hours on the phone.  Finally she said my phone was ready to go.  But it wasn't.  It still won't receive incoming calls.  It's advertised as ""simple,"" but it's by far the most ridiculously complicated and impossible to use of any phone I've tried.  I will be either returning it or tossing it into the trash."
2177,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"I wiah I had this phone a long time ago! It is easy to usw, easy to see and custoner service is great!"
2178,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"I was FOREVER  hitting the Emergency  key.And You can  FORGET  all the features,  You're  used to, because  nothing  is where You're used to it being.I GLADLY  returned it, but  only  after  more than 2 weeks of hassles. trying  to get through the channels, of RED TAPE , REPETITIVE  QUESTIONS,  and 90% of it, by online  CHATTING.It wasn't until  I  got  forceful,  that  I actually  spoke  with a VERBALLY  LIVE PERSON.I got  so frustrated,  I  GLADLY  gave them the PROTECTIVE  case too.It just  wasn't worth  any other  red tape.Has Anyone else  noticed,  that it takes an ACT OF CONGRESS , to actually  SPEAK  TO  SOMEONE,  nowadays?PLEASE  DON'T  BOTHER,  with this phone,  unless it's  Your  VERY FIRST  CELL,  EVER.Remember that  I'm  reviewing the LIVELY SMART PHONE,  not the  RED JITTERBUGSincerely,  Maggie"
2179,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"I activated this on my Ting account. Only downside is the warning ont he screen that activiation is incomplete, but everything works"
2180,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,I bought this as a gift for a family member and he likes it so much.  this phone is very uncomplicated and easy to read and use.
2181,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"After the battery on our second Smart2 began expanding, bulging the case - that's after three years of use - I bought the Smart3. After activation and transporting the Smart2 contents, I discovered that the new Smart3 requires a 6-step process to delete contacts, something the Smart2 did from the simplified home screen. I've brought this up with Lively and am waiting for a work-around, if one exists. Otherwise, both my wife and I are happy with the Jitterbug/GreatCall/Lively/Best Buy experience. Seems that the technology on these phones lasts a couple of years before something breaks or a newer version supercedes this inexpensive phone. I'm probably not the only one yearning for a simple smartphone."
2182,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"I got this phone for my wife who is in a nursing home.  She can not operate this ""easy to use"" phone by herself.  It is one of the most difficult products I have ever experienced.  It was almost impossible to set up; I could not have done it without tech support, which was excellent.  Controls are inconsistent. I have to click on ""contacts"" multiple times to display them; and sometimes it jumps to a different screen.  When I click on a certain ""favorite"" contact, the phone shows the contact below it.  I had to delete that one in order to call the intended one.  You have to press a button to ""speak"" to the active assistant ""hey google.""  With other phones you just talk.  Do not buy it!"
2183,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"Nice large print buttons for use with lower vision.  Apps and functions are displayed one per line.  Touchscreen scroll and selection.We upgraded from an older model with OS that couldn't be upgraded.  All apps from the Google Play store, settings, contacts, and data were automatically transferred to the new device."

2185,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,I bought for my daughter but can't  or won't answer she has to McCall back and there's a chattering in the back ground anytime your on it. I was so disappointed as I had read such good reviews on it. Maybe if she calls tech support they can help her. Also I can't hear well on it. I was going to buy one for me but after hers no way. Maybe we got a lemon but will not chance it now. I'm sure there a good product but ours was / is awful to late to return now. My fault was in hospital.
2186,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,Bought for my sister who has some challenges. Was easy for me to show her how to use the phone which is all we needed.Tech support walked me easily through setting it up as I have never had an Android.
2187,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,Nice upgrade from the Smartphone 2. All around it's nice for what I need! I'm not on my phone all the time.
2188,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,A little harder to set up for this senior
2189,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,Spent an hour on the phone with tech support. Phone could not be activated. Promised to send another phone pre-activated. Free of charge I hope.
2190,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,My son who is disabled due to a brain injury received a cell phone a couple of years ago.  It was not a Jitterbug and it has been difficult for him to learn how to use it so we decided to order a Jitterbug Lively Smart3 phone.  He has had it less than a week and loves it!  The user manual is well organized and easy to understand.  He is reading the manual and learning how to use his new phone.  I think I will replace my out of date iPhone with a new Lively3!
2191,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"I'd been avoiding getting a smartphone, fearing that it would be too hard to operate.  Surprise!  This phone is not hard to operate.  Texts are more fun now, because I can include emojis and gifs.  I have access to my email and the internet wherever I am.  I've been able to take photos and text them to friends and family.  The only drawback is that I've found why people spend so much time on their phones!"
2192,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"Bought this phone for my 82 year old mother. Terrible Lively customer service experience! Multiple calls to the activation line, left on hold for extended periods of time and dropped connections. Voice greeting recording said they were ""busy"". Once I finally got to a real live body, the female agent was polite but refused to activate the new Jitterbug 3 because, according to their Website/Zip Code entry, there wasn't any cell phone service in the community where my mother lives. Not true! Lively operates off the Verizon network and I'm a Verizon customer. I used my cell phone to talk to the agent! Anyway, after some pleading to activate the phone using my zip code instead of my mother's zip code, they still would not activate the phone. I even tried to explain that my mom has WiFi and travels thus would not need a cellular connection where she lives. Not good enough. I suspect they probably wanted to sell me the ""Health & Safety Package"" which requires a cellular connection. Overall this was simply a terrible customer service experience and had I known the process was so restrictive, I would not have purchased this product in the first place. Buyer beware! Do your homework and some Internet research. Plenty of other unhappy Lively customers out there."
2193,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"My mother had the Jitterbug 2, I believe and just didn't like her smart phone. She never really figured out smart phones at her age.The Jiggerbug Smart 3 she has less trouble figuring out and is slowly learning.Larger font helps a lot."
2194,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"Bought for my 87 yr old mom. Had no desire to deal with Livelyâ€™s service and excessive costs. Took phone straight to AT&T to set up. Store clerk put in a new SIM card, and was able to get the phone on my account. He had to make their system think it was an older iPhone version, and it works great.Phone displays a set up error â€œSomethingâ€™s wrongâ€ Insert a SIM card. You need a SIM card to finish setup. Please insert a SIM card. Code: 01Called Lively, rep informed me the phone is not compatible with other providers. He went on to say, he has never seen it work elsewhere. He told me to go back to AT&T, or talk to Livelyâ€™s support reps.Figured I would check with their support 1st. Was told, I am not a (paying) customer, and they would not be able to offer any support. Any troubleshooting to be done on/with the phone would be have to be done by AT&T.They rig their phones to be used with Lively & only Lively.I have no experience with their service, and reading various reviews here & elsewhereâ€¦ I have no desire to use there service.It has been too long to return. Will find a place to donate it.Got a iPhone SE instead."
2195,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"This was a great experience, tried getting this same item by shopping around.  Got the best price and fastest delivery"
2196,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,easy to use
2197,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,This is a great phone for seniors. My dad has Parkinsonâ€™s and this has been easy for him to use and have video functions too.I would suggest having a function to remove the auto lock feature as many seniors have difficulty with swiping and steady hands to log in.
2198,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,Love the battery life and that this phone moves very fast.
2199,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"Grandma needed a simple to use, bug button phone. This one fit the bill!Easy to set up and switch her phone number.she now has easy access and I have peace of mind."
2200,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"I gave this phone as a gift to someone who struggles with technology. It's been great, much simpler than an iphone and it holds a charge well."
2201,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,Very happy with my Jitterbug 3! Much longer no battery life! Can now block sales calls or unwanted calls! Very easy to switch from Jitterbug 2 to 3. Phone techs are wonderful and will walk you through it!
2202,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,Couldnâ€™t set it up so should have returned.
2203,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"I chose this phone because they advertised how easy it was to use, and I find that as I get older it is harder to remember things, if you don't use it a lot. I find this phone much easier to find what I want to do with it."
2204,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,This phone is very easy for anyone to use.
2205,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,Not good
2206,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,"Finally, a smart phone for seniors? Well, at 89 I guess I""m a senior.  I used to be a college professor so you would think I'm smart enough to activate a simple phone  I spent three days trying to go though the set up process finally giving up in disgust.  I called a tech specialist at Amazon to guide me through the process.I found her to be very difficult to understand and to not be helpful at all.  So I am stuck with an expensive phone I can't use and a humiliating experience I hope I never have to go through again.,"
2207,LIVELY,5007SJBS3,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.22 Inches,This phone is a joke.  I requested a new unused phone number and when I didnâ€™t get one I called customer service and was told some b.s. about the phone had to get used to the towers in my area.  I did not fall w/the rain.  Calls & messages come in from all sorts of places.  Disappointed in phone and service. I ca it and will have my bank to â€œblockâ€ refuse to pay!
2208,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Didn't realy want pink but didn't see the options for other colors at the time of ordering so overall i can't complain in that regard, it isnt quite my note 9 that i will dearly miss daily driving but i wasn't going to replace the screen a second time.The note 20 5g is in 9 out of 10 condition only one noticable nick in the side of the bezel where the buttons reside and came with a screen protector pre applied as well.I got my note 9 used/refurbished as well and it wasn't as astetically well off as this one was. That said the wall charger seems a bit sketch and cheap as it said made in china with no other maker info or anything else on it and was only 5v 1.5amp, so i just used my old one.Transfered over my sim to esim no issues (make sure you remove the old sim after as it was causing issues with network), my service provider is mint(t-mobile) and is very responsive on this device and the 5g is a world a part from 4g if you have yet to experince it, there is a speed test in the photos.End point, not the highest tier device like the newer notes maybe but if you need or want a more modern galaxy note device (than say a note 8 or 9) with 5g capabilities at a more affordable price tag than the current gen ones then it really fits the bill."
2209,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Everything about this phone is amazing! It's stylish, fits well in my hand, and fits well in my pocket. Only drawback is that it has a ""cheap"" feeling. Like it's made of plastic that was mixed with some form of malleable metal. Not only that but I recommended this phone to my father. His came in finally and had a blurry camera which we than later found out that it had two broken camera lenses. It doesn't mean it was the sellers fault (most likely not)."
2210,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I was skeptical at first, but I LOVE my Note20!!  My provider service rep was shocked when I took it in to get my old phone paired up with this one and asked me how much I paid for it, etc.  He checked it thoroughly and couldn't find anything wrong with it - not one blemish or scratch!  I'm VERY happy with how it performs and the battery life is MUCH better than expected too!"
2211,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I am not sure if the pen is the original that came with it or not. It doesn't seem to snap right into the hole as it should. Ither tha  that, I love it."
2212,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I had to send my original unit back due to the charger port not working correctly, a massive gouge in screen(used phone tho, so not as detrimental as others) and it missing the pen. The replacement I have received works flawlessly. The support that I received from their team was 100% professional, and always a fast response. Thank you for making this an easy purchase."
2213,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Bought this phone because it allows me to play music thru my hearing aids which my Motorola Power did not.  Functionally this reconditioned phone works great. The offer said excellent condition.  But the back was worn. Seller did give a small discount.
2214,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"This product was better than expected. Very little marks on the side of the phone, easily covered by case. No dents or cracks. Works perfectly. Charger is super fast and battery lasts all day for me.Will purchase from this seller again."
2215,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Purchased the note 20 in green. I have cricket(ATT) service. Recvd the phone, charger and sim card remover. The phone worked fine except I was getting the error that it couldn't activate on the server. Contacted my carrier and they couldn't resolve it. So I contacted the seller that i was needing to return the device as it wouldn't register to my cell network. The seller sent me an inactive ATT sim card and adv to use it and restart the device. After restarting the phone it did register to ATT network, I swapped my cricket sim into the phone and now it works. I've moved all my info from the old phone and it's now working normally. Good buy the phone was in great condition."
2216,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I am Beyond happy with my phone as of yet. the camera is AMAZING. Me and my husband compared it to his Iphone and it was way brighter and the colors were more saturated in each photo. the battery life is really good for it being a refurbished phone so that is another plus. set up was super easy. i just put my sim card in and it asked me if i wanted to convert the phone to verizon and then i did the usual verizon set up. i was able to get literally ALL my apps, messages, calls, contacts, and photos transferred over no problem.  my ONLY complaint, and this is not really a complaint just a little something i didnt care for, was that you can tell the phone had been used before. it had case marks on it and a couple of really fine nicks, but its like my husband said it just means the owner of it before kept it safe. but like i said that is the only slightly negative thing i had to say about it. The price is unbeatable compared to what you would pay for this phone through verizon. would definitely by from this seller again."
2217,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I bought 2 unlocked phones. They were truly unlocked. The battery runs a bit short of what I'd like if you are using certain apps, internet, but it takes and has beautiful resolution, great sound, and seems pretty intuitive."
2218,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Great camera, 5G, but thats about it. My Note9 is quite a bit better business oriented in my opinion than the Note 20. If my note 9 were to have this camera and the 5G features it would blow the Note 20 out of the water hands down."
2219,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"The phone works and look how'd you expect, At first I thought it was locked to another carrier. Turns out it was just my provider needing to resku the imei or something"
2220,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I'm thrilled with my new phone! So I  saw reviews of the biometric fingerprint  feature that stopped functioning soon after getting the phone. It happened with this one too but it's  NOT THE PHONE it's the screen protector that I put on. So now I'm  out $10 but pleased that the feature is functioning.
2221,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I bought this phone after having the Pixel 4a. I didn't care for Googles customer service so I decided to go with Samsung bc my husband loves both his Samsung phones. This phone looks brand NEW! I've had it just over a month and no issues with turning on, the camera, the operating system, etc. Everything has been perfect. They also give you a 3 month refund policy on this phone which is nice. Now my Father will be purchasing one as well to get rid of his Pixel phone."
2222,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I received this phone I excellent condition it was in new like condition, everything worked great on it, but the battery is not that great I could understand if it was a very old phone, but my Note 9 battery lasted longer this phone."
2223,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Great condition! Little worried at first because it's a refurbished model but so far it's great! Def worth the money!
2224,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I was apprehensive to order a renewed phone but I am happy I did.  My phone came early than expected. The phone is like a new phone at half the cost.  It was easy to transfer files from my old phone to the new one.  I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy Note 9 to a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 specifically because I like the note series plus the stylus is embedded into the phone so I have it with me all the time. Unlike the galaxy s series, there is no holder for the stylus in the phone."
2225,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Nice phone like new
2226,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Great phone and price.
2227,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,The cellphone came in perfect condition.
2228,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I am not impressed with the condition the phone is in. It is not clean obviously not sanitized. The phone is a sticky substances when the case had cutouts of buttons speaker etc. I will update this  in a few days about its  battery life and functions. I will update this a second time in a few weeks about battery life and functions.
2229,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"El mÃ³vil estÃ¡ bien, no excelente, tiene rasguÃ±os y el lÃ¡piz no habÃ­a sido limpiado. Sin embargo, lo que mÃ¡s me ha decepcionado  son los accesorios el cargador es genÃ©rico (marca Motorola) el cable  usb a tipo c de 5.0 v. El cargador original es tipo c ambos extremos y de carga rÃ¡pida, no esperaba el genuino del aparato, pero sÃ­ uno equiparable.En fin, para haber sido catalogado en condiciones excelentes y haber elegido un precio mÃ¡s elevado de todos los ofertados, el producto me ha decepcionado. No lo devuelvo porque me saldrÃ­a mÃ¡s costoso porque lo he comprado por casillero internacional."
2230,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Phone was in excellent condition. Everything works just as it should.
2231,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I don't use face recognition, but o really this is a great phone!  I like the larger screen so I can actually see what I am doing and this is clear and crisp!  The camera also is awesome!  I would recommend this phone, and I'd suggest to Samsung to keep making the Note phones!"
2232,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I didn't get a chance to experience the phone. It didn't allow or receive phones calls. I took it to my carrier to check out the phone and the SIM card. They said there was nothing wrong with the SIM card. I finally figured out that I was sent a locked phone instead of the unlocked phone that was advertised.
2233,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Definitely not in excellent condition
2234,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Just the display was scratch I knew it was refurbished but the seller never answer that question about the screen. The phone works great so far
2235,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Edge Cellular has the note 20 listed as FACTORY UNLOCKED when it is actually an AT and T phone. Carrier unlocked and factory unlocked are two different things. Eventually i was able to get it working on my carrier
2236,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,The phone came without its pen which means it won't stop bugging me about it. ğŸ˜¡ as well as the fact that the sim tray is DAMAGED. making my Sim in the phone constantly disconnect and reconnect from my service. If I wasn't in a situation that I needed a phone for work I would request a refund!!!! Does not say anywhere in description that it would be missing stuff and still have broken parts. That are important might I add (Sim tray). Have to replace stuff myself now AND it has a deep scratch through the front screen upon opening box.
2237,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"The specs on this phone stated it had an Micro USB card space. It doesn't. For that feature you have to go for the S20 Note Ultra. Should have done my homework. My main goal was to get one of the last phones available with a micro SD card slot. Great phone, but I like the option to backup to SD card as well as online. 128 Gig of storage just don't cut it for me. I had 45 years of pics scanned plus  many selections from over 500 CD'S dating back 1975 and forward."
2238,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Love the phone dont get me wrong, but the condition that it was in was not up to my standards. Although everything is running perfectly fine, the seller didn't even clean the phone before selling it which kinda sucks. I'll just clean the phone myself but If you aren't going to slap a phone case on your phone, i suggest you just buy a new phone. As for the scratches, I can live with them because I'll just get a case but they really aren't that noticeable but i do suggest you watch out for that."
2239,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Didnt yse any recognition on the phone but its servicing me well for a renewed product.
2240,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Great refurbished phone. Has a lot to offer and I'm still learning. Frankly it's a bit much. The S pen allows you to do some great things. Sound although stereo speakers is still weak.  Battery life barely gets you through the whole day with just light use. I probably get 14 hours before I'm down to 30 percent.  Definitely doesn't hold a charge as long as they claim, so a bit disappointed.  Great cameras but I'm not much into picture taking but when I do it's impressive.  Screen is gorgeous but it still tends to get washed out in sunlight. The fingerprint reader is very frustrating. Half the time it doesn't recognize it which is far too often but definitely a great phone overall."
2241,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"The back cover is sticking out a good 1/16"" on the bottom of the phone. I can also see a gap that should not be there all around the perimeter. If I press on the back lightly I can see how it is supposed to be from the factory. Going to re-apply the proper adhesive myself"
2242,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,This is a C really good phone and the camera is great!
2243,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"i waited a few weeks from the day the phone was delivered to write this review. Let me start by saying that the overall product is very good. but there are a few issues that need to be known, first the phone was supposed to be an unlocked phone, the phone that was delivered to me was an AT&T phone loaded with AT&T apps and software. I managed to remove some of those apps but some of them are impossible to remove. The 2nd issue and the most misrepresented issue is the battery life on the phone that was delivered to me, when not used much the battery lasts quit a while but when used for more than texting and calling the battery life gets short quit fast, my phone looses about 50% by lunch time. These are my issues with the product that was delivered to me and the reason for my 3 star rating"
2244,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"The case and screen were very nearly flawless, perhaps not quite new-out-of-box clean, but extremely close. Functionally, the phone, stylus and power supply are like new. Setup was just like on a new phone. Performance and battery life are as expected. The phone, stylus, power supply and USB-A to USB-C cord came in a generic box. I really can't distinguish this phone from a brand new one in any meaningful way, apart from price!"
2245,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I bought this phone refurbished for half of retail, which seemed too good to be true, and it was.  The phone randomly loses internet signal, and sometimes decides not to ring even when someone calls, or randomly decides not to notify you when you have a text.  After owning this phone for a year I don't see a pattern; only inconsistency.  You get a significant discount, but at a significant detriment, making the price fair."
2246,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,No visible scratches on screen. Very minor scuffs along the edges of the device which is totally acceptable as a renewed product. Passed all the diagnostic tests. Battery seems to last reasonably well.  100% satisfied with the purchase. Will definitely consider buying again in the future.
2247,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I had it for a while it works and looks, as good as new."
2248,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"The phone. Worked  as it should ,but not to my needs. ,seems little outdated ,finger print scanner,on main screen not behind phone ,  I need a new faster phone for my needs , business. This worked ok. But not as fast my 1plus"
2249,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Very scratched up.I thoroughly read the description and understand, but this was excessive."
2250,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Phone looks and operates better than the one i purchased from verizon!
2251,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"When I got this phone it was pretty much new, despite it saying renewed. It still had the protective cover on the screen, and it came in its own sealed box with all the accessories. This phone didn't have so much as a fingerprint or smudge on it.I would also like to add that, after using the phone for a day, its much more responsive and snappy than my Note 9 was (I upgraded from a Note 9). This phone is indeed unlocked as advertised.If you are on the fence, I would recommend getting this phone. You won't regret it. I sure as hell don't."
2252,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I love Note phones. Easy to use. Very very happyâ™¡â™¡â™¡
2253,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Was excited to get this phone. Took it to my local Verizon center to get it set up. Experts there worked for two hours trying to get it to work correctly. Tried three different SIM cards but nothing worked.They felt that this phone had the global set up rather than the US version as described on the Amazon web site. A total waste of time and money. Needless to say, it's on the way back as I write this. I'm beyond disappointed.Does Amazon validate the information other organizations it's affiliated with place on its web site? Doesn't look like it to me."
2254,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Although this device did not work out for me, Customer Service was very responsive and way went over and above in their attempts to rectify the issue, even offering another phone and accessories at no cost."
2255,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"The transferring of data was the most simple from my previous Note 8 experience. I instantly noticed the beautiful bright screen. The colors were really vivid and I was most impressed with the quality. The battery charged very quickly and keeps the life even after constant social media scrolling and other app use. Also, the camera quality is nothing to skip over. Looking at the picture is very crisp. I do have to try out the other features of the camera, but so far I do not have any complaints."
2256,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Cell phone looks nice, works good, but battery life VERY VERY poor! Thinking about returning it."
2257,SAMSUNG,Note 20 5G,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Expensive phone at half the cost.*Doesn't come in original box nor original charger. The charger that it came with is was a Type C USB with the wall charger, but takes up to 4 hours to completely charge phone. I am using my old Samsung phone's fast charging charger because it works better than the one it came with."
2258,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"I was fairly cautious buying a refurbished phone for the first time but I feel that the first thing I should put here is that I was VERY surprised by the quality received. The phone was nearly spotless and functioned with the snappy response you would want to see from a flagship phone (even a two year old one). As advertised it comes in a box that is not the factory direct one, (something that many reviewers seemed to somehow miss written 2-3 times in the description). All in all, the phone had a ""peely"" screen protector within a thick phone shaped bubble wrap ziploc, within a high quality phone box that sperated the peripherals (charging cable and sim pin) from the device and all of that was in a small sturdy ship box. I received the phone two days earlier than slated to but that is probably just because it was only from new Jersey to Connecticut. The phone powered on very quickly and stayed on for over 30mins on 1% charge before I plugged it in.Now to the only unfortunate part. I use a somewhat indy carrier whom I am pretty attached to called Republic Wireless. The galaxy s10+ IS compatible with them but ONLY the somewhat rare factory unlocked model (SM-G975UZKAXAA or SM-G975U1 when abbreviated in the phone's settings). This listing is for unlocked models NOT necessarily FACTORY unlocked models. So the unfortunate result was me receiving an unlocked model SM-G975UZKAVZW or the Verizon model. It's worth noting that more than 95% of you out there will not have an issue with this difference but for me this made the phone completely unusable.That leads me to the last part of my review and the reason I wanted to leave this review after my experience as a whole.On realizing that I had an unusable phone I was understandably disappointed and frustrated and reached out to both the seller (PromoDealz) and Amazon. Admittedly, seeing a name that sounds like a corner pawn shop (truly no offense guys, I'm not what the kids call hip..lol) I was a little worried about the follow up I'd receive but that anticipation, like the ones about a refurbished phone in general, was blown away. What I got was quick clear responses with nothing but the intent to try to help me out. After they had gone through their whole inventory to check for what I needed based on my messaged information they offered to extend contact to phone and we connected to discuss the problem. They didn't make me feel like I was being a hassle at all as they took all the information I could find on what phones work for me and checked their entire stock of s10+ (50ish pieces) then offered to receive their next shipment of 200+ pieces and check those too. These folks seem like good people who are dedicated providing a good service here. Hopefully they weren't cursing me behind my back lol. Wouldn't blame 'em.Unfortunately after the hunt they didn't come up with what I needed and, as they had offered as a worst case (or immediate if I'd preferred) solution all along we processed a return/refund. I somewhat assume that the carrier specific models of this phone are vastly more common because most people buying $800+ flagship phones are doing so because of incentives, financing and deals through larger carriers (""get a new family plan and get FOUR free* super flagship phones at only $300/month"" *phones free for first two months then at a monthly payment plan of $150/month for 97 months and a $700 plan cancellation fee applies when you find all the other plans out there for a quarter the cost.... Sorry I'm a bit biased against big carriers).Anyway, all in all, I'm shocked you're still reading this. I'm a lot less concerned about the refurbished concept after seeing the quality of the phone received as well as the quality of the seller's support and Amazon's backing. (Amazon support fellow actually said ""don't worry, we've got your back if you get any trouble from the seller"" luckily no trouble so I didn't have to call big brother)You still reading this?Why? Go read a book. Or like, listen to one or something.Terry Goodkind's sword of truth series has good audiobooks... On the road listening maybe?Too lame? Maybe go watch something on netflix or disney+?Falcon and Winter Soldier is not bad so far...Evil Genius was good for you true crime nuts..Seriously.I of all people am not that entertaining.At least go find yourself a phone. I assume you need one if you're here reading my stupidity.Ok.Bye then."
2259,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"Of course I was nervous buying a 3.5 year old refurbished phone. But I am very pleased so far. I had a Galaxy S10 when they were new phones and really liked it. Last February I bought a new s22 but never liked it as much. I thought it was too clunky and thick, and recently I've been having trouble with the blue tooth dropping out. I like the feel of the s10s and s20s so much better than the s22s. So I decided to go back to an S10 Plus. It doesn't have 5g, but truthfully our t mobile 5g is not totally reliable, and usually I had to turn my s22 back to lte. This is the second reconditioned phone I've bought from seller Chubbiestech and both have been great. I did order a phone in ""excellent"" condition, so I'm sure that makes a difference also. The phone looks great and you'd never know that it is ""used"". And it's got the headphone jack and sd card slot so all is good."
2260,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"OK. This was purchased from ""Prime W"". It was advertised as ""For AT&T"" - so you can imagine my head just about blew up when I powered it up and the Verizon logo popped up. (Verizon phones are generally CDMA phones and AT&T are generally GSM phones), since the description of the phone did not indicate this phone had a dual SIM capability, I assumed I was going to have to go through the return process to get a phone that would be compatible with Consumer Cellular's AT&T network requirement. Lo and behold - the phone was compatible with Consumer Cellular. Usually, kismet in my favor in these matters is not in my favor. This time, God's finger reached down and touched me.The phone itself came in pristine condition. Only a consideration when you're buying a ""renewed"" phone. Prime W not only included a genuine Samsung fast charger, but they also put a cellophane static cling screen protector for shipping on AND shrink wrapped the phone. Good on you Prime W. The charging port appeared unused - usually a good indicator of how the phone was used by the previous owner. For all intents and purposes, this was a new phone - which is important because the phone is now my wife's.The only issue I've encountered is the inability to remove a phone alert that I've inserted a non-Verizon SI"" card into the phone. With this phone, I spent some time with Consumer Cellular's customer service department, but after some nudging they were able to get it in service.The phone immediately updated to Android 11 and the most recent Google security patches. The Samsung Smart Switch accommodated the transfer of files from her S7 and Google did the rest. Since my wife never deletes anything - I added an additional 128G SD card and she's off and running.Samsung's S10+ is the same phone as the S10 except the screen is .3"" larger than my S10 but I didn't find it unwieldy - and she likes the larger screen, but it's not like some of these phones where you find yourself suddenly carrying a ""notebook"" around. Women carry their phones in purses -- men generally in their pocket. So, for her it's the cat's 'jammies.As with any phone that you're using out of the original network, it came jammed with Verizon bloatware which can't be removed but can be deactivated. It'll just sit there wasting memory but by-and-large isn't an issue. Many apps can be moved and stored on the SD card freeing up phone resources - unfortunately useless Google and Verizon proprietary software are largely permanent squatters on your phone.Plus, this phone is compatible with all of my wireless Anker chargers so that's nice - but the Samsung fast charger wall plug adapter is really quite impressive. Just saying.I'm not a ""Samsung guy"" because I got used to and spoiled by LG until they decided to get out of the phone business and I had to switch phones to get on to Consumer Cellular but this phone, like my S10 is really something. The cameras are vastly superior - I mean, the difference between these phones and my old LG is the difference between lightning and lightning bug - not even a close comparison.On the same note, the audio is just kinda ... WOW! Understand that I'm not a kid, I'm a tail-end boomer and proud of it, when I'm listening to my music or watching video, I'm not using buds ... I'm using full blown Bose noise blocking headphones. I've got to say that I didn't know what I was missing all these years. Really quite impressive.Now understand that this phone does have a 3.5 headphone plug which is nice ... but it also has a dedicated Bixby button right below the volume buttons on the left - so even deactivated, Bixby will be a recurring irritant ... like a bad, bad laxative. Come on Samsung ... dump that P.O.S. :o)Anyway, very, very nice phone - props to Prime W -- for a bunch of ""East Coasters"", you folks are aces in my book."
2261,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"This is my 3rd time ordering a refurbished  phone off Amazon and I highly recommend it if you don't want to spend the absurd prices the market wants for technology we make everyday. I saw this phone being sold by a legitimate storefront âš ï¸ALWAYS DO YOUR RESERCH WHEN BUYING ONLINEâš ï¸ I loved the previous Galaxy S8+ but it finally gave out after 4 years of buying it refurbished from another Amazon partner, which is amazing because I got it for $200. Now I bought the Galaxy S10+ this week for only $230. Now I just hope this phone will last me another 4 years or longer like it's previous version did. And I tell you what that Galaxy S8+ was a champion ğŸ†,  he took beatings and swam places deeper than normal fish can withstand  pressure and have there eyes pop out. Also I gave a 4 star review because my phone came PRISM WHITE ğŸ˜ . I really could care less honestly  about the color but I was expecting Prism Black. Oh well. Another phone, Another Time."
2262,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"I was afraid of buying a renewed phone because I thought they'd be in the worst condition but I decided to give it a go cause I needed a phone. I have to say, I was very satisfied. Everything works as new, takes way better pictures the the s9 line. The only thing that made this a 4 star is that it came with screen burns. Meaning, when I'm on a white page it shows faded app icons from previous use, like burned into the screen. If this was in the description when I bought it then it would've been expected but it wasn't. Everything else works fine the updates went smoothly and overall it was good buy."
2263,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"This is the second of the two Amazon Renewed items I've bought, the other was a Galaxy Tab, that has lived up to the good review score and impressed me with its condition. I got the S10+ which is only $20 more than the base model and has a bigger screen and 17% bigger battery. It looks and feels brand new, the only exception being the slightest amount of wear around the charging port. The screen works perfectly, with no pixel issues.I'm very happy I decided to go with this formerly top-of-the-line 2019 model instead of the current versions. It looks and feels like a luxury item and the screen design stands out today against to the run-of-the-mill looking S20, 21, and 22 models (S22 Ultra excepted). I can't believe how smooth the front screen is. It's so smooth, in fact, that it begins to glide across any smooth surface that isn't level, so it may end up somewhere other than where you left it like the hard floor. Safer to put it backside down.The fingerprint reader is built in to the screen and thus invisible. I gave it 4 stars only because my previous phone has a dedicated reader on the back that is instant, and it's what I've become accustomed to. The reader on the S10 takes about half a second to register. It has a cool factor, though, in that it works even with the screen off.I gave the battery 4 stars because it was down to 75% after 1 day of light use which is a bit less than I had expected/hoped for. I feel like it got worse after I ran all the system updates vs how it behaved out of the box; I remember being surprised at how little the battery had gone down when doing all the app installations and settings. I have pretty poor cell reception though so it may be due to trying to constantly communicate with the cell tower. Also the battery screen says it's ""learning"" my usage habits so hopefully it will improve.That being said, these are minor sticking points compared to what you get, and overall its 4.5 - 5 stars for me. I doubt there is a phone anywhere near its specs and condition for the price, currently $220 for this formerly $1,000 phone. AMOLED, 522ppi (which is much higher than the current models), 8GB RAM, 128GB storage, USB-C charging, a Snapdragon 855, and it even has a microSD port which they have removed from the current Galaxy S's.I've read some reviews stating not all sellers end up sending the US version and to check your model number when it arrives. FWIW I bought from Chubbies and got a SM-G975U1 with the Snapdragon 855 and it works with TMobile.Edit: surprisingly the display isn't set to the max possible 3040 x 1440 by default. You need to go to settings -> display -> screen resolution to enable it. What the heck Samsung?"
2264,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,IT KEEPS TELLING ME I HAVE TO DOWNLOAD SOMETHING! I HAVE EVERYTHING DOWNLOADED.. I'M NOT GOING TO MESS WITH THIS PHONE N I DON'T LIKE THAT MY SMILING FACES & THINGS AREN'T ON HERE  .YOU HAVE TO HOLD YOUR FINGER ON IT TO BRING THEM UP . THAT'S STUPID.GOOD SCREEN WHERE I CAN SEE GOOD..
2265,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"Supero mis expectativas.  Es un equipo que practicamente no diferencias de uno nuevo en cuanto a condiciones esteticas.  La camara es impresionante, rapidez y fluides es hermosa.  Es importante notar que viene en caja generica, con cargador generica.  Pero por el precio lo vale.  Definitvamente lo recomiendo si buscas no desangrar la cartera con un equipo de gama alta de modelo no tan reciente, pero que conserva todas las caracteristicas de uno nuevo."
2266,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,Not sure phones ok.  I know refurbished and supposed to be in good shape.  Many people on calls w me complain I of sound quality.  Speaker and/or microphone not quite right.
2267,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"Nice Phone - Really Functional - Durable -  Great Price!I doubt that I'll ever buy a new phone again (unless of course HTC comes out with another outrageously great phone again)! This phone meets all of my needs, and what the hell, I'm likely to lose it or break it before it truly dies (Wasn't the case with my Samsung Galaxy S-7 - it randomly died, and hosed me)."
2268,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"Received the phone today and I could not be happier. Not only is it a great performance phone, but there's no way to tell this refurb from brand new. There isn't so much as a micro scratch. It's perfect!Thank You! I will be back for my wifes phone."
2269,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,Purchase this a number of months ago. I use it with Verizon. I had it verified that it was unlocked. Phone works well and has a good battery life. Would definitely purchase from this seller again!
2270,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,Looks a good
2271,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,I received this refurbished phone within 24 hours after ordering and was quite surprised at how well the condition was of a refurbished phone. It was boxed well and was in new condition. Happy with the purchase and the speed at which I received it. Would recommend.
2272,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,Overall great phone for the price but the battery life could be better. I know it was a refurbished phone but I have bought from them before(s8+) and had it for years. I'll definitely buy from them again
2273,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"Every few years I upgrade, I always get a few versions back because I cant put out $1000 for the latest hotness, to only run it over with the lawn mower LOL true story, so I started to research and have almost always been a samsung guy and saw reviews on youtube and asked friends and read these reviews and settled on the S10+ (Plus) when I got it (2 days early, thank you Amazon) it was an amazon refurbished like new, and it was all that and more, easy setup, put my Simm in it and it went right up on the network zero hassle didnt have to call support, loading all my apps I have become use to took some time in the Play Store hahaha but I shouldnt have to do that again for a few yearsall the Youtube reviews of the S10+ were really good and most were putting it up against the S22ultra, I wasnt holding my breath, but sun of a gun this is a nice phone 128gb storage, 8gb ram and 4k video WTFIn the past I have had Motorola (I liked it) then iphone (thought it Sucked) LG (just a cheap P.O.S) and my last 4 phones Samsung and got use to ease and quality of themAudio Quality: People can hear the differanceCamera(s): and the main reason for my OMG I could write a book (F***ING AWESOME)Bluetooth: hooked right up and works great with my radio and head setSpeed: nice chipset! snapdragon is noticeably faster, your gonna like itAndroid OS: it updated itself over night to version 12.1 (the latest as of this post) and works seemingly faster too, went to play store and updated all apps to latest hassle free.Battery life: so far after 2 days is as good or better than my last Samsung Note, and I am a heavy userMine was ordered service unlocked: not sure what service it was supposed to be on but my Simm on a subcompany of Verizon just worked no hassle, from the tone when it boots I think it was made for AT&T but being unlocked it didnt matter, and I didnt have to do anything other thanput my Simm in it and turn it on and start using it! (Easy)I hope i didnt leave anything out, because before I bought this I also read all the reviews and the one stars must have got a bad seller or maybe the 1 in a 100 lemons, but I wasnt worried and it worked out 100%"
2274,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,I feel like this was a  Good Purchase so far so good
2275,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"I paid $177 for a s10+. It arrived in good shape with no noticeable scratches on the glass but a few on the frame. Out of the box and upon first power up the one I got gave a moisture in the usb c port error until I cleaned the port with 90%  alcohol and a rubber dental pick. Dex isn't working with a Baseus dock that worked fine with my S8. The problem may be the dock, I'll update with my findings and any problems with this S10+."
2276,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"So far it's EXACTLY as described. This is the first time I've bought refurbished, and I must say I'm impressed with the quality that I received and I'll probably end up buying refurbished for my next phone. I popped my AT&T sim card in and memory card and it worked immediately. After a few updates and setups I was ready to go. The phone I received was factory unlocked like advertised. I seen a few reviews where they received carrier locked phones, but mine was unlocked. There was literally not a scratch on this phone. It came with a generic box that was sealed, came with new generic charger and cord (was not fast charging block though, but no big deal as I already had one). Speaking of charging, I was a bit worried when I first got it because the phone would start charging and then all of a sudden stop. I would wiggle the cord around and it would start working again, and then stop right after. I thought for sure I was going to have to send it back, and I didn't want to after it was perfect condition and unlocked. However I switched cords I was using and so far it hasn't done it yet, but it's only been a day. If I starts back, I'll have to send it back because what good is a phone if you can't charge it? I know it has wireless charging, but I paid for a phone to work completely and that's what I would want. Besides I don't even have a wireless charger, and wouldn't want to spend the extra money on it when it should charge by cord in the first place. Anyways I'm hoping it was just my cord, but it's weird it didn't do that on my other phone. I will update review later after I see how that goes and hope it's not the charging port going out. Battery life is so so, I mean it's probably expected for a refurbished phone I suppose. It does go down pretty quick, but I'm sure it's where I've been on it nonstop since I opened it too. Will update review later on over battery life too. Other than that, I'm very happy with my purchase! The seller I used was OlympicWireless I believe that's how it was spelled. Very satisfied SO far. The blue is very nice on this phone and I'm glad I got the blue instead of the black like I was originally going too. If your worried about buying refurbished like I was, take the chance because there is an Amazon guarantee if it's not up too par anyways. I'm glad I did!"
2277,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"I purchased this Galaxy S10 plus a month ago.The phone arrived fast from Florida with charger but without orginal packaging. The reason I'm writing a review is because I'm very happy with my purchase and I was skeptical to buy a renewed phone called in brand new condition.  It's indeed looks brand new. No scratches,  no visible signs and in perfect working condition. Everything works as it supposed to."

2285,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"A decent price for what I was looking for, shipped quickly and securely. The battery life isn't bad considering the age of the phone. It came with a generic charger (that I've not used). Any physical defects are very minimal, it's obvious that whomever had the phone before kept it in a case. I was worried spending so much on a phone sight unseen and had read some horror stories but I am happy with the phone and the seller."
2286,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,This phone arrived in just a few days in brand new condition.  I was weary at first buying a phone online but I'm very pleased with my purchase.
2287,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"Purchased from FlipCells.Phone came in one layer of bubblewrap, shipped in the box it was placed in. Seller decided to GLUE ON a screen protector, probably to hide the fact the display had numerous small scratches and one or two cracks at the edges. Sides of the phone are also visibly scuffed, like someone threw it at concrete lolI don't really care about the aesthetics, it'll be in a case anyway and the display scuffs arent distracting, but it's still kinda scummy they decided to try and hide it from me. All functions of the phone work, did not receive a carrier-locked version, and the camera quality is insanely good for the price I paid for it."
2288,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,It was in excellent condition. Works really well.  Battery last long. This is the second one i get. I've had it for about 2 weeks. Bought one for my wife 18 months ago and is still working really well. This is way better than buy from local store.
2289,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,1st off S10+ is a great phone this is my 3rd because I like it so much. BUT BEWARE of these coming from Amazon there was a small QR code on the back of my phone I scanned it and it took me to several hackers websites and USB hackers and on Facebook best hackers in the world page.Had a bunch of symbols that are not from the US all on the pages alot not in English so be careful of people stealing your information on these phones. My email is on the dark web for sale because of people like them.

2291,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"My screen was broke on my Samsung Galaxy S8+ and I needed a replacement quick. I was able to find a replacement phone on Amazon for about the same price as my deductible if I filed a claim through the cell phone insurance. I decided to get the S10+ because it would arrive in a day. It is an Amazon Renewed Device (refurbished). The phone looks new! You cannot tell it is refurbished. Set up was simple, I put the SIM card from my old device into the new phone and within minutes my new phone was up and running. I'm not a person who needs the latest and greatest phone and really don't like to finance phones through phone carriers. So I would definitely purchase a Renewed phone again."

2294,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"Battery life is insane of this, i would go 4-8 hours with moderate-heavy usage with this and it will only drop about 30-40 percent of its battery percentage. Finger print is very quick and effective, making opening the phone a breeze. Amazing little features on this such as wireless power-sharing, .5x camera, dark mode etc... feels as if it were brand new. Only downside i could think of the s10+, the power button is located a little higher on the side of the phone unlike other samsung/iphone power buttons, where it is located near the middle, but thats just me nitpicking..Would buy  this product again."
2295,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"I received the galaxy s10 plus few days early and it's been amazing. No scratches, scrapes, etc looks brand new.

The phone is a great switch and especially it being 2022 it still works flawlessly. I will continue using Amazon in my future buys :)."

2297,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,Not bad

No regrets whatsoever and couldn't be happier... As to the phone capabilities, I suggest Youtube reviews... Two notes to be aware of:  1) shipped without headphones and 2) battery charger was not a Samsung charger and did not support fast charging... I suggest going here to buy original Samsung chargers.

My phone wasn't suppose to be here until Wednesday I ended up getting it early when I opened it up the phone I received is as in picture no scratches no cracks and was unlocked made switching phone for Metro super easy.. I can truly say I'm excited about my purchase. I set the face recognition and fingerprint reader and both work the battery was at 40% when I received it but so far the life on it after having it for 3 hours is absolutely amazing.

2303,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"Quick version:Phone condition is Like New. Seller, RE-CELL, is exemplary and quick to reply.Long version:Received phone with 2-day shipping and was near perfect except for what looked like a small smudge below the screen cameras. (Picture 1). Barely visible unless the light hit it at a certain angle. Because it was the screen I contacted the seller to see if this was normal. He apologized saying it was not acceptable and to return it and heâ€™ll send another out and included a rebate for my inconvenience. He didnâ€™t have another white, but a black. Thinking about the black, and looking at images, I was getting to think I might like the black better than the white. He contacted me saying he received a white one. I told him Iâ€™d rather have the black he had instead. He said it was sold, but heâ€™ll source another black one for me. Which he did. Same day. At that point I realized he sourced a white one for me, and then a black one. Geesh. He sent the 2nd phone out once the return package was sent. So free return shipping, his exchange was sent FedEx 2-day to get it to me asap. He included a small wireless charger. Email responses were prompt.Phone looked Like New (Pictures 2-4). The seller checked that it would accept my carrier out of the box. And it did. I checked with CPU-Z app and verified this was the better regarded Snapdragon (7mm, USA/China), not the Exynos (8mm, International) that should sell at a lower price-point. After 2+ weeks with the phone the only way I can tell this was a used phone is the battery. Everything is working perfectly. Iâ€™ve just started checking the battery with 2 apps, but they differ. One is just above the Amazon 80+% at 81% (AccuBattery), the other is showing 71% (Battery Guru). More charges are needed to be more accurate, and AccuBattery is highly rated and reviewed. Nonetheless, way more than enough battery capacity to last me a day and still have 30-40% left, and the phone is 2 years old. So there's that.In short, anxiety about buying a used phone, especially if problems arise, are a non-issue with this seller, RE-CELL. I will be searching out this seller for the next phone for anyone in my family.I was very pleasantly surprised with their customer service and can recommend RE-CELL without reservation."

Â UPDATE AT THE ENDHi. This are my first impressions on my S10 plus green/blue. I contacted the seller so I will need to update you. The box it came in was ok but inside was the phone swimming... I did not take points out because the phone is in Superb conditions!So far is working really good and looks and feels new.I love buying renewed products, you save a ton and help the environment.On that note I had a budget and was about to buy the prism white, beautiful, I also fancy the green but it was a bit more expensive, at the end I went for it and got the green!I received a blue phone.Here is the thing, I live outside the US and returns are a no no, unless the item is very expensive and is really necessary to send it back...needless to say I paid more and did not get the color I paid for... dissapointed...Ok. I had the samsung S9plus, therefore the data transfer and setting is as easy as can be, but the battery was needing a boost.... oh wait! the S10plus is not type C?! Well... it is, I received an iphone charger.... my charger is dying, I was happy to get a new one... dissapointment number 2...I was also worry because as you can see in the picture, one of the camera lenses looks ""off"", so far it does not seem to affect... we'll see...Ok, all is good, I need my phone for work and it works, is perfect, let's not get too wrap up in little details... I should have just order the white...Why four stars? Because is in perfect conditions! All in all I will buy a renewed phone again and again, just a little sad about the color and the fact that I paid extra for nothing...Waiting on the providers responds, I'll update.UPDATEGreat Customer Service and fast response! Of course they asked for the device back but when I explain my situation they were willing to send me a small refund and maybe a new charger... all good. Still 4 stars... i have a blue phone..."
2307,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,128 GB,Android 9.0,6.4 Inches,"The phone is rgeat. The ergonomic design makes it easy to hold and USE. Whather just checking your mail playing a game or using Google.docs, with 8GB of RAM and the Top SoC chip from 2019 at it's heart. Great pics, great video, and you absolutely will not find a better phone in the US under $600 USD, never mind the $200-$285 this typically sells for. It also has a headphone jack for one of the 35 sets of earbuds you've collected over the ages. Standard USB charging without the annoying port that Galaxy's normally have.The 1080p 90 FPS (?) widescreen allows for great video playback as well as gaming, which the afore mentioned SoC and the 8GB of RAM help immensely with. $1100 USD two years ago, less than $300 now, unlocked, works great with Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, Mint, Straight Talk etc etc. The internal 128GB of memory is nice, as is the ability to drop in another $30 128 GB mini sdcard in if you're going to be recording a LOT of video without the ability to get to a PC or Laptop (Or just upload it to the cloud) for some reason. You an also carry around an extra cadrd or two if you want to record 10 hours at 4k for whatever reason.Voice quality is awesome, voice recognition is great, though you may want to keep it off for pricacy; it's just a kickass phone.It was also advertised as in ""Good Shape"" when irl, it was in ""New: condition save the battery which was at 95% available cells. Worth every penny, and if you have a kid, or you like to consume media and play games on your phone, besides an iPhone with it's unbelievable new SoC, this is right up there with any other current flagship (And it can play Fortnite along with numerous other gmes not on iOS for whatever reason). I could go on and on about the productivity, lack of Bloatware besides Knoxx Security and Bixby (It has Mcaffee but never, ever use that. Get the free version of Avast and Malwarebytes, or lol, anything but Mcafee or Norton's). You can also just wipe it and install whatever OS you like, though sticking with Android is advised do to drivers, but you do you, as it's great to tinker with and fantastic out of the box.Hope this review helped, and the seller get's an A double plus on this one."
2308,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"Those product works well, I'm writing those review on it. Main problem is that the screen isn't as durable as the WP 5. Already has scratches whereas I still have the older model and screen still has no scratches. Fingerprint reader sometimes doesn't read, but works most of the time. Increase of processing speed is nice however"
2309,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"not compatible with consumer cell, nice heavy duty phone"
2310,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I like the size of the screen, the tough exterior, and the overall look of it. But the finger print feature don't work also the face recognition isn't working as well, otherwise it's a nice phone."
2311,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I bought this phone solely because of the advertised battery life. Now I'm not an avid phone user, but I do use my phone for texting a lot, and for light gaming (no graphic intensive titles, mostly word and puzzle games), but this battery has lasted me a full work week (5 days), and more. The most days without charging I've gotten out of this phone is 10 days (mostly on standby, but a bit of texting and a bit of gaming). Performance wise I'm coming from the 6th generation of an iOS device, so the performance of this phone is far and BEYOND my expectations. The phone doesn't lag, and responds very quickly. It also does not come with any bloatware, but the default Goggle set of apps. You definitely will not get a phone with the impressive specs (128GB storage, 8GB RAM, octa-core processor, AND either dual SIM tray, or single SIM and micro SD for EXTRA storage capacity). What iPhone or Galaxy (or other Android flagship phone) can boast those specs for less than $300?? Definitely 100% recommend this phone, but for those people who don't care for a THICK, heavier than normal, simple to use cell phone. If sleek and weightless is what you're seeking, look elsewhere."

2313,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"This is only an initial review after about a week's worth of use, but so far so good. First and foremost, it's big. And it's heavy. It makes my old Pixel phone look like a dwarf. But the battery went three days without charging and still had juice. It was easy to transfer everything from my old phone, and it works fine on Verizon."
2314,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I've only been using this phone for a few days, but so far, it's definitely a great phone. It's fast, reliable, and with the 256gb memory card, it's pretty much a flagship quality phone. I usually buy whatever is the newest, most feature packed phone that's currently out, and I've owned more than 1 flagship model. I've got to say that this phone will keep up with any of them, and it has night vision too! I'll update as time passes, but so far, as long as you don't mind carrying a big, heavy phone, then this could be the phone you're looking for. Can't fault the size or weight because of the crazy big battery, so for now I have nothing negative to say about it."
2315,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,This phone is amazing it has a little of everything. If your a camper it's got tools for you a student it's got you covered to..a contractor yep you too. It even has those pesky picture hanging nightmares taken care of. And so much memory it's unbelievable. I absolutely recommend this phone if you are tired of buying a new one all the time cause your screen breaks this bad boy holds up.
2316,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"tl;Dr: great phone for the price, not rugged, extremely bass-y over BluetoothI upgraded to this phone from the wp5 of the same product line (still working great, just slow). At first it seemed better in every way but with use I found 2 major issues. The first one is that the Bluetooth turns the bass well past 11 which means I still carried the wp5 around if I wanted music, podcasts or whatever.  The second(and deal breaker for me) is that the durability has significantly dropped off since the wp5.  Keeping this in my back pocket just like I still do with the wp5 caused the corner of the screen to pop out of the frame.  To be fair it still works and I can probably disassemble it and get it popped back in to place, but any faith I had in this phone reliably surving my work environment is completely gone and I've already gone back to using the wp5 at work until I find a different replacement. If you are fine with slow I'd still recommend the wp5 but for someone like me who looks for durability first the wp16 is no good."
2317,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"My kid had an earlier model that didn't have infrared and only about half the memory. He loved that phone and loved this one even more. It's heavy AF and I wonder whether he'll get carpal tunnel and if I'll have to reinforce his pockets, but he's in absolute love with this phone.These phones are damn near indestructible, but he managed to shatter the screen of his previous Oukitel to the point that the front facing camera component showed. I hope this one fares better ğŸ¤·."

2321,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"The usb-c connection for charging didn't last even a year. I've been careful with all my phones. Its loose, so I have to have it connected a certain way in order for it to charge. I used to like it a lot until that issue came upon."
2322,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,its a really good phone for the price runs most games i try the only reason i gave it a 4 is minor glitches like hard to click top of screen sound only coming from front speaker and don't receive messages from Facebook messenger until i unlock phone but all of this stuff barely happens

RETURNING! Even the keyboard is STUPID no caps lock or options to change it to a keyboard that doesn't suck!Almost forgot, there's this stupid Google search and a day and date on the middle of my home screen that CANNOT BE REMOVED, THAT IS GOING TO FORCE ME TO RETURN THIS SUPER STUPID PHONE I HATE HATE HATE THAT THE MOST!!!!!!!!!!!!"

2334,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"Overall is wrong from not fast enough but just a job done and we'll get you out of being stranded pretty quickly at least the stranding is because of a low battery. Seems to have an older version of Android that doesn't work particularly well but it's functional and you can use it pretty much as fast as you would a phone from 3 or 4 years ago. The extra features are nice but I rarely use them but having been in the forest in the middle of the night having the camera with the infrared light does help see wherever you need to see. I keep this phone as a second phone because I never know when my first phone a brand new pixel pro 6 will run out of battery and leave me stranded, it does that job well and even works really good Wi-Fi hotspot not particularly fast but it has enough battery that it will work for about 6 hours of that. Does not charge fast expect when you get down to zero battery to take about 8 to 16 hours to fully charge with even a high-powered charger. Max is about 10 watts charging. But most the time I'm charging from 50 to 60% and it takes about 6 hours. Screen has a protector on it from the factory and that scratched up pretty quick I've left it on until I get a new screen protector but the screen is taking plenty of abuse and never had any sort of problem"

2337,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"After the first one was stolen in the shipping process, the Oukitel distributor sent me another one. I really like the phone. Well made. Just received it today, so it hasn't been put to the test yet. However, the speed of the operating system is great. The only thing I would change is the power button location. It sits right where my thumb rest, causing me to accidently close the screen if I'm not paying attention. I wish it was placed higher up on the phone. That bugs me because I always use long passwords instead of the fingerprint, facial recognition, or number code. The speaker on this phone blows my last phone and several other previous phones outta the water too. I'm not a gamer so can't comment on gaming abilities for the phone."
2338,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I am very pleased with this seletion of tuff phone..! It is heavy, so if you need a phone for just the every day jog or just that important tie to the office's need to reach you, this phone is much to qualified for any of that sort of thing.. This is by all means a tuff cellphone.. The discription surrounding this cell phone does not do it any justice, because this phone is what you would want out in the field where normal cell phones would not stand a chance.. It has to be the best cell phone if by chance you find your self in a battle field and in a position where this phone's dependability is what you are betting on to save yourself.. I love it if you can't tell by now..! I don't care where I am, I can depend on this phone to get me in touch with anyone and everyone.. It has a lot of great apps and it is capable of expansion with added memory cards if you are planning to use it's cameras for a lot of photos on the go.. I have not had the moment yet to try it's nite photography but if it's like everything else this phone is, I'm sure it will be just as great or more than I will maybe ever need... I rate it a ten. Oh yea the battery life is just as awesome as well, it seems to never need a charge ..."

2340,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I have had this just over a week now and I am impressed. I usually go with contract phones and pay way too much.This is dual sim with space for an sd card too. Transerring data and apps from old to new phone was fairly painless but always takes longer that you expect and can be stressful if you have not done it before. But got there in the endNow about the phone it comes with a clear silicon sleeve which fits well and feels good in the hand. The phone is light as it is predominalty plastic but does not feel cheap.The battery life is excellent and the finger print recognition is best I have ever used. I have also ativated facial recognition which is great for me when the phone is picked up it comes to life and facial recognition is almost instant. (Covid face mask not with standing). There are menus and features on this phone that I have never come across before which makes navigating down into them somewhat labourious not helped by the usual lack of a manual (so far not been able to get one) hence the four stars.The processor is fast and it will be interesting to see if it remains so once all the usual app paraphernalia are loaded.The camera is good and takes excellent pictures and video, it is possible to remove the oukitel branding from photos but as stated above finding this in the depthe of the menus took most of the week. The upside is any photo you send say in whatsapp does not have the branding attached to it. The is no gallery icon for photos (or not found it yet) all photos are held under an icon called files where most things sit. I use google photos so not a major issue. I have given four stars instead of five because of the lack of information manual nad the large number of menus and sub menus associated with this phone. I promise to master all of it before I die."
2341,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"This is my second Oukitel 'phone having previously purchased the K3 around 30 months ago which I did find a little heavy in weight, although again a very good product.  The Y4800 is much lighter in weight and perfect for a jacket pocket even in a secondary case.  The improved operating system using android 9 is very useful.  I managed to copy all my data from my old device using Google Drive without any problems.The Y4800 has 6 GB of RAM which is excellent as well as the 128 GB of internal storage there is also the facility for an SD card as well as the two nano SIM cards which I make use of. However, it does not have NFC which I would have liked, but, when you consider the price of the device I am pleased with the purchase.  Camera quality is acceptable.  I use the Y4800 for streaming music, making 'phone calls, messaging and everyday internet use, including using gmail with little problem via both WiFi and data connection over 4G.  With it's LTE facility I have little problem getting a connection.  Again set up of my data connection was extremely easy copying all relevant settings via the blue tooth facility from the K3.A very good 'phone excellent value for money with all the benefits of Android 9.  Light in and on the 'pocket' (or in hand of course) at 176 grams with nifty operating speed at around 2 ghz. with quad cores. My home Wifi 'pulls' at circa 55 meg and 'pushes' at just over 20meg with this product.  A great device when you just need to check something quickly without having to strain your eyes by courtesy of it's 6.3 inch screen or spending time performing the 'admin' tasks that modern life now seems to throw at us increasingly.  The thickness of the phone is 8.1mm which is 'up there' with other well known brands that cost considerably more money.  I cannot find fault with the Y4800 and would recommend the product."

Ohne groÃŸe Erwartungen entdeckte ich unter Blitzangebote dieses Teil, dazu noch ein Rabattgutschein um 20â‚¬, da habe ich ""zugeschlagen"". 2 Tage spÃ¤ter traf das GerÃ¤t bereits bei mir ein. Es beeindruckte mich sofort, keine MÃ¤ngel festzustellen, alles eingestellt, alle Apps heruntergeladen, alles funktioniert zu meiner vollsten Zufriedenheit und das superschnell. Die Kamera macht ausgezeichnete Bilder und Videos, der Akku reicht mindestens 1 Woche bei fÃ¼r mich bei normaler Nutzung (ich bin kein Freak!) meiner 30 Apps. Noch habe ich keinen einzigen Bug gefunden, Android 10 lÃ¤uft ohne eine Macke, sogar ein Sicherheitsupdate war gleich abrufbar. Voll kompatibel mit Google Play Store.

Toller WLAN-Empfang. Eine Projektion des gesamten Handybildschirms auf meinen riesigen TV-Apparat funktioniert mit einem Klick, einfach super. Einziger kleiner Nachteil ist das Ladekabel, denn alle meine alten Kabel passen da nicht mehr! Leider ist auch keine versprochene Displayschutzfolie angebracht oder dabei, was mich schon etwas Ã¤rgert! Aber der Kundendienst hat mir geschrieben, dass mir eine Folie nachgeschickt wird?

The Huawei 1gb RAM  had stopped receiving updates and some apps were hard to get operating with a lot of jiggery. I couldn't add new apps without deleting others due to RAM space.Pleased with this item as it has a large RAM at 6gb and 128 gb storage.  Easy enough to use although I somehow couldn't find they keypad to dial out, I may have deleted it along with the google dross I was ditching. Anyway found a dialer in the play store and all sorted.Not too much bloatware pre installed , that's good.I only have a couple of minor gripes, I miss the little flashing LEDs the Huawei had telling me I had a message or email etc. without having to pick the phone up and pin in to see.Also , I really miss instructions. I couldn't even find an online manual. Never mind though, a great product . Super large screen stacks of memory.  Why would anyone bother with an Apple?"
2346,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"Bought this phone last year and it has been fantastic all round, highly recommended! Very good value for money, easily on par with all the current leading phone manufacturers for less than half the price the only 2 negatives i have about the Y8001: is although still a very reasonable camera it isn't quite the 48MP as claimed but again for a mobile phone camera is plenty sufficient..2: the camera lenses and LED flash light section of the device sits proud from the rest of the device, so when putting the phone down over time gradually scratches the lenses which then obviously degrades the actual picture quality, but this luckily can be avoided buy purchasing the phone case dedicated for this model which is fitted with a very practical 360Â° swivel stand & car air vent mount which then illiminates this from happening so id highly recommend this is purchased along with the device which is also a very reasonable price. All in all id give this device a well deserved 9\10. ğŸ‘"

The main camera in this phone is pretty good. The standard camera app includes some nice bits like slow-motion video and settings for night, panorama, portrait and others - for getting a bit more serious I popped the Lightroom app on and use the camera in that.Images are sharp, colours are rendered well and there is very little lag between pressing the shutter button and the photo being taken.I didn't bother taking my camera on holiday last week and relied on the camera in this phone - I got some fairly decent pictures.."
2348,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,I cannot fault this phone for the price you pay it is fast 6 GB Ram it has lots of storage 128 GB and it supports all the APPS i need like Facebook Instagram etc.It looks and feels like a more expensive phone and for a tenth of the price of the latest Samsung i cannot see why you would not buy this phone.One thing to be aware of is that i could not get 4G at first you need to go into settings and find ACCESS POINT NAMES(ATP) under advanced settings and manually put in your service provider details. I just googled Virgin Media ATP and it came up with all the settings to manually enter i saved these and works perfectly. Some providers will automatically load into ATP on your phone but for some reason Virgin did not.
2349,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"It's a great great phone! I was pleasantly surprised by it - though it's a larger phone than my old one it's quite light which is perfect as I have small hands. The RAM is impressive, nothing freezes and it works really well and quick. The quality of the camera and video is also really great -much better than my old Samsung phone. The best feature for me was the huge capacity of the memory, I don't need to agonise over how many apps I can keep or choosing which family pictures and videos I need to delete because of the extremely limited storage. I was a little skeptic about sourcing my phone from a company that wasn't Samsung, IPhone or Sony but I can say with full confidence that I do not regret switching and the purchase I have made."

In merito al C21 come agli altri posseduti precedentemente non posso che esprimermi positivamente in merito al rapporto qualitÃ  prezzo sono telefoni affidabili e duraturi(li cambio solo per aggiornarmi con le nuove tecnologie) riguardo il C21 ottima fluiditÃ  con il nuovo OS buono il fingerprint e il riconoscimento faciale anche in oscuritÃ (si accende il display illuminando il volto) devo ora valutare con calma le funzionalitÃ  della video camera che appare comunque molto migliorata anche se nei notturni(vista la fascia medio/bassa) lascia a desiderare ma per poco piÃ¹ di 100â‚¬ cosa si puÃ² chiedere?? E un grazie ad Amazon che in un pugno di giorni consegna con tutte le garanzie legali UE, considerando che la casa madre offre dal 11 novembre c.a. il C21 a poco piÃ¹ di 90â‚¬(aliexpress) ma arriva dalla cina quindi tempi lunghi, incognita garanzia e non trascurabile dogane Italy(vedi dazi) quindi se interessati al C21 acquistate al volo su Amazon."
2351,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I've had the phone for a good couple of months and I have no complaints, I wish I could purchase a really rugged case for it but there isn't much available, but the screen is amazing and it's faster than most phones I have owned, don't be put off by the make, it's specifications are high for the price and I'm happy with the purchase"
2352,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I am a bit of a fan of these Chinese phones, I had an Oukitel K7000 Pro for a couple of years which never caused any problems and to be honest if I hadn't cracked the screen I would still be using it. To replace that I bought  CUBOT phone which to be honest was more than a bit 'average' but I managed to loose it over Christmas so I went back to OUKITEL.So far so great, latest Android release, easy setup, good camera, responsive, and pretty slick in all round operation. You can get better phones yes but you'll struggle to get close to this for Â£170!You aren't going to impress any teenagers but meh, well worth a go however in the value for money arena."
2353,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I refuse to spend several hundred pounds on a smartphone or get a contract that costs Â£50 a month just to get one. This phone has been great as far as i'm concerned. Calls ok, texts and messages absolutely fine. Quick connection when i need Uber or to check train times. 128Gb storage so i doubt i'll ever need any more. Battery life is good too but i don't stream a lot of videos/music.  Had this for a few months and had no problems at all. In my experience there's always going to be someone who has problems with smartphones no matter what the make - this one's been fine."
2354,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I've been using this phone for a good few months and I'm really impressed. I was a lifelong apple user but the price tags are absurd now so after struggling through other android brands to find something decent I've finally found one and I'll never go back. It's easy to use, it's fast, runs games and multiple apps with no problem .Built in call recorder , WiFi and Bluetooth settings very simple for connecting various smart devices speakers etcNO NASTY POP UPS FROM MANUFACTURERSCamera quality is good, probably not as good as the very expensive phones but it's more than adequate"

Fotos sind bei guter Beleuchtung auch gut (siehe Foto vom Gartenzwerg).Was man hier fÃ¼r um die Hundert Euro bekommt, ist der reine Wahnsinn. Echt!Einzig das KunststoffgehÃ¤use muss sich im Alltag noch bewÃ¤hren, was die StabilitÃ¤t betrifft.Eine SchutzhÃ¼lle ist allerdings schon dabei.Und man muss bedenken, dass hier ein komplett neues Smartphone weniger kostet, als eine Display-Reperatur beim XR.

2358,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"I broke my Samsung while visiting NYC and bought this one as a temporary substitute but I fell in love with its battery life. The camera is amazing for cell phone photography. It is very easy to use and responds promptly. The only problem I had with it was when I returned to Turkey and tried to install a Turk Telekom SIM into it. The phone didn't respond to that. I wonder if it works outside the U.S. If not, my money is wasted because I do not live in the U.S. I took a star out for that :("
2359,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"I just got the phone a couple of days ago but have been using it constantly and putting it to the test a lot in the last 48 hours.  It feels really nice in the hand and has a fairly premium feel to it despite it being very budget friendly.  Love the large screen.  The facial recognition and fingerprint sensor are perfect... they both work really well and i have not had any trouble with either one.  It's got android 12 which is cool and fun to use.  I love that you can take a picture using the fingerprint sensor... excellent idea and makes it so much easier than having to worm your thumb around to hit the button on the screen .. esp. with a large phone like this.  Lots of little extras that you can discover if you spend some time playing around with it. The downside is that it is a bit on the slow side.  It definitely does lag when opening apps .. some apps take longer than others.  Scrolling thru Twitter and Instagram is bumpy at best.  Other applications on the phone like settings, contacts, email, messages, etc, seem to scroll just fine.  But not a super quick phone if that is what you are looking for.  That said, you can get used to pretty much anything and for the money this is a pretty solid device.  I've had two other TCL phones and liked them both very much.  This one is my favorite size-wise, but the other two models had faster processors.  Screen colors are pretty nice.  Photos aren't bad.  The camera seems improved over the TCL 20s which is the other model i own.  Not a point and shoot camera - you have to take at least a couple of shots to get it perfectly clear and focused, in my experience.  All in all fairly pleased with it.  Early days so time will tell but as of right now it's not bad.  Battery life is great.  With moderate use you will definitely get a full day and then some."
2360,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"The phone I was using prior to this one was slowing down a bit and also the battery life seems to be draining faster, as well as charging slower. I bought this phone thinking I'd be getting a bit of an upgrade, but it's not a great phone, honestly. The speakers are awful and the processor is the worst - my two main qualms. Otherwise, it pretty much functions like any other phone. I've been debating just switching my service back to my old phone but then I wouldn't know what to do with this one since I can no longer return it. I mostly bought it because it was slightly bigger than my previous phone but honesty... There's hardly a difference. Major pass on this product.Update: TCL Direct-US reached out and sent me a very kind response per the review I've left stating my disappointment. They offered to provide a full refund for my purchase. I have been using this phone still during this time and I'd say that it's still a functional phone despite my opinion on specifics. I am comparing it to a phone I used to use prior to this one which I found to be comparable, whilst looking for an upgrade without breaking the bank. This phone may not have been what I was looking for, but it could very well be what you are looking for. I think many people would be satisfied with purchasing this phone. Regardless, I find TCL's customer service to be excellent, attentive, and friendly and I am happy with my experience in the end."
2361,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Did I mention ***** AWESOME ***** [My first cell was the original brick phone - yeah I'm that old]  Not much impresses me any more!!  â€¢ This is likely the best phone yet. Hands down, beats Samsung to aPple, (but two cups and a string is better than iCrÂ°p.) I've owned them all. I have not wanted anything that this device did not have. I loaded my favorite launcher, keyboard, and other background OS controls. (Can't do any of that on an iThing - LoL) Did I mention ***** AWESOME *****"
2362,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Cons,The screen is not pure inky black and has poor side viewing.The cameras are not world class.Feels sluggish at times.You need high sensitivity, low impedance headphones to get the most out of the 3.5mm headphone jackPROsThe screen gets BRIGHT, and when looking at the phone head on, it is vivid and clearThe camera app is intuitive, easy to use, and pro mode is a bunch of fun... for me anyway!after 3-4 hours of updates, disabling\removing bloatware and unwanted programs, the phone feels responsive and I'm able to play hill climb racing 2 without any hiccups.As a phone goes, everyone says my voice is clear, not much low end in the ear speaker from the other person, but it goes loud and it is clear, same goes for the stereo speakers at the bottom, speakerphone works well, there is no time warp delay, or hearing yourself when you call.I believe I have actually upgraded my phone, as a phone. My note 20 ultra 5g SUCKED as a phone constantly dropping calls.This phone feels premium in the had and the cameras are protected by the thinnest of phone cases. the clear included case works perfectly fine!______________________________________________________________________________I am very happy with it, overall.10/10 FOR PRICE/PERFORMANCEwould recommend this phone to anyone who does not care if things are INSTANT. I think they used SLOW lpddr, paired with slow mmlc 64GB creating a unique bandwidth problem. The pages scroll much better after things are loaded. (I'm using the phone for texting, conference, and yep, phone calls all are instant with no lag whatsoever, same with home-screen/phone/settings navigation all really smooth)"
2363,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"I had recently bought a new car(Subaru Crosstrek) and I bought this for the primary purpose of using it with Android Auto since my older phone was so spotty with mobile data that it could not keep a constant connection during my trips.My early impressions have been mostly positive with this phone. The phone feels premium in the hand with a nice, large screen and every function that I have tried so far has worked smoothly.Battery life is better than my previous phone but isn't as good as I had expected during actual usage(after about half a day of moderate-heavy usage the battery is already down to about 40%).Overall though I am very pleased with this phone as it operates smoothly and feels nice in the hand but most importantly it works without a hitch with Android Auto."
2364,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"PROS: Fast, 6MB RAM, good battery life, decent display, fingerprint and face recognition, good camera and camera options (50mp and macro options), add'l storage option, earjack plugin, case included, pretty easy setup, great price.CONS: No 5G or some financial app functions, but I don't need it and it's not really that available in many places. Slightly larger than expected, but pretty ergonomic, so no biggie. Telephoto not available in 50mp mode, a minor disappointment.I bought for $151, outstanding camera for the price!"
2365,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,Decent budget phone had a mind of is own like putting itself into braille mode and took a few hours to get it back to normal and the touch screen defenetly had issue more times then not
2366,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Arrived in undamaged box, but screen has damage right from the fact.Purchased new, not refurbished, should not have been sent a detective phone.Did activate it because I needed a phone, and still do!Also, phone reboots randomly and rejects updates.  Phone updated, all updates appeared on screen, but when I reboot the phone, it reverted to original configuration without being reset.Screen damage not caused by me or by abuse. Display is really nice and phone processes quickly, but cannot get around receiving what appears to be a refurb, when I bought direct from Amazon as a full price new phone.Returning for credit, will likely buy a different brand...one with hardened glass screen.I never thought that a manufacturer like TCL would hide the fact the screen is plastic, and flimsy enough that something in the box tapped the screen during shipping (charger?) only to expose that the screen is not hardened glass.The reboot loss of updates issue effects functionality."
2367,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"It's everything that I was looking for. My 6 year old lost his phone and it was time to visit Dad so I purchased the he TCL. It works great for him. He can play games, watch Netflix and call me.I noticed that it runs a little slower than I'd like but for the price who's fussing.It was a great buy for us."
2368,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"I picked this up for Google Fi because I didn't want to spend 500 to 800 dollars on a phone that was only a bit better. This was a fantastic choice. The camera is infinitely better than a phone I got from Motorola for 200 dollars. It runs awesome, the screen looks great, it sounds good. All in all I really like it and hope that it continues to work for me for years to come."
2369,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,You can tell it's not a Samsung the ui is not as fluid perfect for me cuz I don't need to spend big money on phone you will need to restart this phone every couple days I've had for 2 months and it works well I had Samsung a21 from bout 4 years before and it's bout as good as that but in newer model can't find anything this good for less than 300 to 500 in my opinion I'm happy I activated through straight talk if want know how it pretty simple
2370,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Got it for my mom. Almost better than my iPhone. Huge screen with great resolution and colors. Not 5G capable but a great phone that can do as much and even more than my iPhone albeit more slowly because the processor seems weaker. Still, if you get this phone you will be quite impressed for the cost."
2371,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Had to do a return. First phone that I got has a bad memory and I had to do a hard restore to get it to work, and then continued to have issues. Lost some photos that were not backed up.  The replacement phone has had no issues and is working as expected.  Camera is good, could be a little better for nightime shots.  Good size and good speed for good enough (lower powered) graphic games.  Bright and clear display. Audio is good for the price. Used a TMobile reseller for minimal anual amount and should be good for emergency uses and or when primary phone battery dies."
2372,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Don't do it.EDIT 7-14-22:  this afternoon TCL/Amazon combined the 20se with the 30xl page so that suddenly it looks like this unimpressive, laggy, newly released 30XL (with 13 reviews, mainly negative) somehow shot up to 2658 positive reviews in one day. Seems a bit underhanded, doesn't it? Let these actions guide your decision to purchase from this company that wants your data.  END EDITDon't do it.I know the price is tempting. There may even be a 15% off coupon. But this is a really bad choice for a phone. Even setting aside their privacy policy - FWIW the first time that I ever read one that I instinctively thought was more intrusive than Google. Go look it up. They monitor EVERYTHING -the phone itself isn't impressive for too long after you press the power button.I ordered this because my old Moto G from 2020 can't keep the charging cable attached any longer.  I'm a thrifty guy who still enjoys tech, and I thought I'd found a hidden gem in the TCL. The price was right and it was a modern phone from a reputable manufacturer, and overseas reviews were fairly positive, so I thought I'd give it a try.When the 30XL arrived I was excited, and I thought I'd stick with it even after being disturbed by the privacy policy since I needed a new phone immediately. Be sure to read it, though. Wow.I got everything loaded up and... Wait, is something wrong?  Why is this brand new phone slower than my two or three year old $180 Moto G? Maybe it's updating. No, it's just slow. Wow, it's REALLY slow. You'll see if you order one. It lags from the start.Sure enough, I looked up a comparison of the processor in this 30XL (Helio G25) to the outdated but decent snapdragon 655 in my cheapo Moto G, and this 2-years newer phone is humiliated by the old Motorola.TCL? That's not how this is supposed to work, guys.Well, at least the display is better. Oh, wait. Never mind. It's a 720 display. Huh. So it's slower than the old Moto G I'm replacing, and the display looks worse, AND it's already lagging before I've even loaded any programs on it. And all for $200.I sent it back. This is unacceptable, even at this price point, and consumers should reject this silliness lest manufacturers believe it should become their standard for quality.Avoid if it costs more than $100 or so. You'll be disappointed if you've ever had another phone. You've been warned. You're probably better off finding a used Galaxy S10 or 2nd generation IPhone SE or something else in this price range but still capable of adequately performing routine tasks.Again, avoid.EDIT: I don't get anything for free for being a ""top reviewer in men's gloves size L"" or anything like that, but please click the helpful button if you found this helpful so we can get this to the top and save everyone a bunch of time and money. I can't imagine the hours and gas wasted by tens of thousands of people like me who think they've found their Moto G Power replacement but who will end up returning it. Thanks."
2373,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,10/21/22 Update: So far so good.  No other issues and increase to 4 stars.WAS:Reasonable low-cost phone.  Got it working with H2O Wireless reasonably fast! But disappointed there is no WiFi calling.  My older Redmi 6 pro had this function. Device to device requires a USB cable should be documented.  I have to start fresh.
2374,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"For the price of the phone I was stoked for what I was getting out the box.. big screen, big battery, decent stereo sound from the speakers, but what I soon found out was that the battery wasn't quite working with this phone. I reached out to TCL and explained my issue and they immediately sent me out a replacement phone to make things right. When I received the new phone I checked again to make sure all was working correctly and it wasn't. Frustrated and wondering what was going on I reached out to TCL yet again and explained to them that not one but both phones were no good. TCL was super helpful and friendly with their customer service that a manger was spoken to about my problems and a solution was brought to my attention. They upgraded me from the 30 XL to the 20 Pro 5G phone free of charge for the inconveniences I may have encountered. I was truly grateful for this offer and they were super nice about the whole ordeal. Although the 30 XL wasn't working right the fact that TCL not only sent me a second replacement phone but to upgrade me to another phone without hesitation shows how much they care for their customers. So one bad phone doesn't make this a bad company. I'm now happy with my phone and happy with their customer service."
2375,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,So far I have only used the finger print and number code. I haven't used the face recognition yet. The battery life seems to be very good. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't have a call screening feature that I had on my previous cellphone. Maybe they'll look into that. I am happy with everything else.
2376,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"I absolutely love the battery life. It is an all day device absolutely. The thing I do find strange however Is that very little info exists about this model and it looks just like the tcl 30 SE. But had its own unique packaging. Just a weird  qualm I had with it. Also I couldn't find it listed anywhere, could the seller list weather this is a 32 or 64 bit phone. Absolutely worth the price on sale."
2377,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"At first I was apprehensive about the whole phone, took a lil bit to set up the first time but after that, itâ€™s smooth sailing, super user friendly great camera software easy to edit pics,love the screen size fits in pockets very well.I was impressed by the battery my prev droid killed my battery while using Netflix, easy to get use to many options for security with or without face recognition or thumb print."

2383,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"this is the phone if one is almost out of a coverage area, while the Cubot X30, Redmi 11 pro, Umidigi A13 pro, A9 pro pulled in my location below 1Mb/sec on mobile data, the TCL went up to 20 Mb/sec !!! also the reception on bluetooth and Wifi is outstanding, what is missing is the 2nd mic for video in stereo, it has 2 speakers but only one mic!!!!, the camera is very good, actually better even than the Redmi 11 Pro with 108 Mpix, The only negative is that it says charger incompatible even with the charger which came with it, but it still charges"
2384,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,What I like: It's a big phone. The finger print sensor works well and it's in the rear. Mine came with a gel case.What I don't like: The Bluetooth doesn't always connect. The Auto light sensor can't seem to make up its mind weather to adjust to the right brightness or not. You can't turn of Google sync. There's no light up dot to let you know there's a message when the screen is locked. Some bloatware you can't uninstall. Very glitchy at times and slow. The TCL 20S is a better phone. Consider buying that before this one.
2385,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,Phone is a little big for my small hands. So far so good no complaints.
2386,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,I reordered and had to pay shipping. It corrupted itself. I reset and it never worked well after. So this is second time around. It's a nice phone. Takes beautiful pics. The size is good for me and light enough. I have arthritis. So if any problems arise again. I will right a new review.
2387,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"I used up 20GB right away from updates, but 40GB is a good amount. The screen size is awesome. The RAM speeds make it really fast and smooth when navigating through things. The only stutters were when I was installing and downloading updates while swiping through a webpage.Only downside is that there aren't that many ""Heavy-duty"" cases for this phone (It's the equivalent of a TCL 20se. The 20se has an extra button on the left side, and the 30XL does not. The case would still fit for the right side power and volume buttons.) A heavy duty case is important because it is essentially a cheaper substitute for a warranty.I bought the phone anyway, and I am pleased so far. I will be putting a 12 month Mint service sim in it because Mint is GSM."

2398,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Good phone, super nice color."
2399,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"TL is making an amazing set of phones for really good breakthrough prices.  I happened upon the brand when seardhing separately for inexpenive phones with great battery life.  My iphone hand-me-down from my wife, a 7plus, really was poor on battery life and it drove me crazy, which is why I sought something with really good battery life.  In practice, however, thie 30XL battery life, which pretty good, was not as good as advertised.  The battery life, however, generally did fit my needs for sure.  My problems with the phone are several.  I was not able to enable WiFi calling, and now I find that a number of the TCL phones to not permit WiFi calling except with certain carriers.  Bummer.  There were many features I really liked but one problem I couldn't live with.  When texting I had to take extreme care to not hit the lower margin of the space bar or the punctuation boxes.  If I was a bit low it took me completely out of the text screen to one of several others and I had to then search again for the text function and go back and find where I had been.  I found this intolerable and it may well be that somehow it can be overcome with an internal OS adjustment.  I don't have the time or energy to go through all of that, so I was within the return window and I did return it.  Today I ordered the TCL 10L, which appears to have wonderful features and is an upgrade from the 30XL.  I would very much like the 20Pro but didn't want the 300 price tag.  Ii got the bundle with the ear buds so we'll see how all that works.  Sincerely hope this helps someone."
2400,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Actually is a very good phone. I really havent found a downside to it. If youre looking for a very up to date phone, with alot of the newest features, but at a lower cost, this phone is it. I suppose if i had to dig for a fault it would be that its hard to find info about this phone online. Almost like it never existed"
2401,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,20 as he had the Alexa button on the left side where is the 30 does not have it. I really like the film and the abundance of features!
2402,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Awesome phone, great options and features from face recognition fingerprinting apps and download you can ask for a better phone easily connects to T-Mobile network."
2403,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,I really like the TCL 30XL It just seems to have speaker issues
2404,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,It was a little difficult to set up but once it started all was good. It would not take my 512 sd card and seemed to erase all the music from it not sure yet other wise great phone
2405,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,Very happy with this phone so far. The size may take some getting used to. Most everything transitioned very easily.
2406,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,It is a great fall to all for the price loved it
2407,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Update:TCL reached out to me and took steps to right the situation. Their customer service is fantastic. Thank you for helping make things right.The phone is slow and laggy, freezes often and is just underwhelming. I've hade cheaper phones with less ram preform better. Sound quality is poor, even for a budget phone. Had a recent update that seemed to help a little."
2408,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I purchased the F3S to replace my Umidigi A7 Pro which I purchased in 2020. I was reading about this device and could not find it on Amazon.ca but did find it available on Amazon.com. Shipping to Canada was much faster than I had anticipated taking only 4 business days to get to me. I've used the FS3 for a few days now and here are my first impressions. First off the setup was the easiest I've ever had with a phone(not sure if that praise is to Google or Umidigi or both), I was up and running with all my apps downloading in under 5 minutes. The device arrived with the battery at around 90%. There was a system update waiting after the initial setup. If you haven't used a Umidigi device before one thing that surprises me is their continued update support. The day after purchasing this device I received a system update for my 2 year old A7 Pro, a lot of manufactures will stop releasing any updates a year after they are released Umidigi breaks this norm. The packaging was very slick and simple, it did not give the impression that this was a budget device. The device was very secure in the packaging no jostling what so ever. There were also stickers on the front and back of the device showing the features and layout of the phone which was handy. The package also contains a USB Charger/good quality cable(looks the same as the cable that came with my A7 Pro which is still functioning after 2 years). There is also a gel case that comes with the device, it is good quality but I find that it can get slippery to hold, I have ordered two other cases to replace it. The phone operates smoothly for my day to day tasks, the battery lasts me the day and if I forget to plug it in overnight I still have about 20-25% battery in the morning. It can also handle gaming as well(although the device does get fairly warm). The finger print reader has so far been very reliable not many misreads and no lock outs. The shortcut button is a handy feature although one draw back is it will only function when the screen is on. I've set mine up to: Flash light, Camera, Voice Record for single press, double press, and long press respectively. I did have a minor issue with reconnecting to hidden wi-fi networks but was able to resolve this by going into the developers options and disabling ""Wi-Fi scan throttling"" it seems to be a battery saving option, if you don't need to connect to a hidden network you will have no hassles. The speaker is a single speaker it does the job but its not anything special, I rarely use it I prefer to use headphones. The FS3 also comes with a headphone jack which comes in handy when your ear buds die or are misplaced(hahaha). The headphone jack is on the top of the phone and the power cable plugs in to the bottom, I would have preferred them both being on the bottom but its not a big issue. I've trusted the Umidigi brand the last few years and when I needed a new phone I looked to them first because I knew I was going to get the best bang for my hard earned buck. So far I am very pleased with the phone and hope to get a few good years out of it."
2409,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I got this as an ""update"" to my last Umidigi phone - an A11 - because, while I really liked the A11, I've gotten it in my head that I need a phone with NFC capabilities.I'm glad I decided to pull the trigger on the purchase, especially considering the price on Prime day.As always with Umidigi, the packaging itself is attractive, eye-catching, and high quality by itself. The phone inside of that packaging is the same.The screen size is great for watching media and the back of mine is a sparkling black color. All of the Umidigi phones I've had have been made of high-quality materials - both the screen and the rear of the phones are basically impossible to scratch. I'm absolutely *terrible* at holding onto things, so I drop my phone on hard surfaces multiple times a day and keep it in my purse pocket along with my keys. Despite this, I haven't had a screen or screen protector on an Umiidigi phone break or scratch at all.Not only is this F3S fast with its 6gb of RAM, the fingerprint sensor is *extremely* responsive and the battery has lasted me though 36 hours of relatively constant use. The NFC feature is honestly just fantastic. I've used it far more than I probably should have in the seven days I've had it with no problems and I'm so glad they included it on this model.The camera is really nice as well. The shutter speed doesn't have any delay and the image quality is very good. I haven't really had many things to take photos of because the weather has been terrible and my house is a mess, but I got a *really* good picture of my cat in pretty low light (I also included an accidental awesome picture of her from when I was trying out the ""burst"" mode while she was grooming herself in this review even though it's a bit blurred because she was moving lol)The only problem that's come up on this phone thus far is an issue with the notification volume being super loud sometimes, even when the phone is on silent. I did figure out that this is an Android issue (as opposed to a manufacturer problem) because I found the solution on a Pixel forum - for anyone experiencing this, the OS apparently gets the notification and media volumes mixed up. All you have to do is turn your media volume down to fix it. Kind of annoying, but not a particularly big deal.If you *do* happen to have any actual phone problems, Umidigi's customer service is absolutely top notch. They're super responsive and very helpful. I haven't had any real issues since a couple of phones ago, but any time I have needed to contact them (obviously within the year warranty), they've responded within 24 hours (not including weekends) and have solved my problems quickly - including being happy to replace a defective unit."

Â I've had several UMIDIGI phones before, but this one really stands out.  First, it's the right size for me (I'm 6'4"" and have a big head lol).  It fits perfectly in my hand and feels ""just right"" when making a call.  No fumbling with a smallish phone in my large hands, yet fits nicely in my front pants pocket.  It's amazingly light, too.This listing does a great job of describing the features and the reviews do well too so I will only emphasize ones that stand out for my own use.  They describe the screen as ""cinema-like immersive visual experience"" and it no hyperbole.  It is *stunningly* smooth, no shadowing and has absolutely incredible viewing angles.  It has a nice size for video viewing and is large enough to use for ebook reading.  It's actually the first phone that I found reading ebooks to be comfortable on, without eyestrain.It is fast, too.  Boots immediately and is very smooth between apps.  Battery life is really good too, but isn't too much different than my last UMIDIGI phone.  The very best thing is how well the thumb-based fingerprint reader works!!  This is the *ideal* location for a reader, as it is right where you naturally hold the phone and is on the button to open it.  I have never seen a reader work so fast recognizing and how fast the phone itself opens!I have but 3 negatives - this phone is awesome and loaded, so why not 2 speakers in stereo?  The screen is cinematic and gorgeous, and the absence of this is regrettable.  The next 2 are a bit of personal preference - while the camera is incredibly good, I could do with a bit lesser camera to have to have less of a camera bump.  I go caseless (it is gorgeous and made of durable material) and it rocks all over the place when on a desk or table.  While using the included case alleviates this, it still rocks a lot with it on.  Lastly, while UMIDIGI made the ""Beyond Dreams"" tagline less obtrusive than my previous phone, it is still there and just bugs me.  Just go with your brand and perhaps the model number.I tried to get some nice screenshots and a video of the smoothness of it but I cannot capture how nice it is in person.  It's first rate, comparable to the top of the line phones of other manufacturers.  At this price, it is a terrific buy that will serve well for years to come."
2411,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Let's get this out of the way early, once again Umidigi has created a beautiful phone. I chose the 'Starry Black' over the 'Ocean Blue' this time and it's just as stunning as the blue is.Highlight #1 - NFC  - let me repeat, NFC that supports Google Pay, on an inexpensive phone for the U.S.A. market = #Winning.Highlight #2 - A full 6GB of ram and 128GB of LPDDR4X based storage. Storage is expandable.Highlight #3 - 5150mAh Battery. Coupled with the entry level Unisoc T610 Octa-Core Processor, which basically sips battery, this phone should get you through a full day of useage without breaking a sweat.Highlight #4 - 6.7-inch Display. It's crisp and clear and does surprisingly well outside. Ok, the colors are going to be washed out in bright, direct sunlight, but at least you can still read the screen if the need arises.Highlight #5 - Sony 48MP AI Triple Camera. I;ll need to read up and take some picturesHighlight #6 - Still comes with a headphone jack. Bluetooth still doesn't quite cut it for audio performance and I am glad to promote a phone that still includes a headphone jack.Highlight #7 - They have included a wall charger in the box.For us old-school peeps who still listen to FM Radio, Umidigi has included one. And gome one step farther by NOT requiring a headphone to be connected to be used as an antennae - it works without one just fine.A quick stop at some niggling points: the auto-brightness algorithm could use some improvement and Umidigi doesn't exactly provide timely updates, but does seem to release an update to fix issues.Th UI is basically stock Android. No fluff, no extra, duplicated, unneeded apps.Fingerprint reader is integrated with the power button which is on the right side of the phone beneath the volume rockers, and is as responsive and accurate as expected.On the left side of the phone is a 'smart key' (button) that you can use to initiate up to three different actions such as: screen shot; start recording; open an app.I've gotten some pretty good pictures although I haven't tested the 'night mode' yet. There are standard and 'pro' shooting modes along with HDR and some different filters to enhance your shots and selfies.I still don't know how Umidigi continues to roll out mid-range performing phones and feature sets at bottom-tiered pricing."
2412,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Bought this specifically for the NFC and WIFI calling capability. Only after I bought it did I find out it would not work with both my endoscope and Flir thermal USB cameras. Interestingly the Flir camera actually connects and is visible in the program but then immediately disconnects and terminates the program.  This obviously indicates the phone is capable of the connection and appears to be ""coded"" or programmed to terminate camera operation. When I contacted the seller they said the camera will not work and is not supposed to. Thus four stars."
2413,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I got this phone I liked the phone however it was a 3G phone which most companies no longer support it is not a 5G phone which it is listed under  please change the wording on this phone

Â For the price I paid the phone has everything that I need without breaking the bank. It features a large screen, plenty of storage (128gb) and generous amount of ram (6gb). For this price point I had been looking at phones with 4gb ram and 64gb storage.When first turning on the phone I went through the setup quickly. The fingerprint reader is a must have and I set three fingers with ease. Unlocking the phone with my fingerprint is seamless each time without hesitation. I went to the OTA updates and updated the phone right out of the box, took a few minutes and everything was good to go.Having Voice over LTE and Voice over WiFi is great, it helps the call clarity and VoWiFi for when I'm in a poor reception area. Dual SIM is nice so I can use my personal and work line both on the same phone. You can disable the second SIM when not needed (so my work calls don't come in after hours).The 6.7"" screen makes things very easy to read and view. Playing games works very well for the screen size. It would be nice to have a faster refresh rate but I didn't expect this in the price bracket.The processor, gpu and ram make for a smooth experience for everyday use and handled all my gaming tasks without hesitation.The camera takes good pictures but the response time seems a bit sluggish when moving the phone around. But in all fairness I had compared this to my wife's phone which is the S22 and cost over $1000.The battery is quite large and lasts me a few days with work, games and day to day activities before I need to charge it up.Overall I'm quite pleased with my purchase. Getting the features that I need, and performance that I feel will last me a few years if not more before I feel the need to upgrade."
2415,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I come from Blu G90 Pro and wow with 6GB of ram makes a big difference performance. Screen is bright clear video. Game is not too bad but Helio G90 can tell difference in game. Great phone if your looking for clean android user interface. Umidigi F3S is speedy.
2416,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Phone is great for the price and nice looking.  So far it works fine.  Great that it has large storage size.  Camera quality is not very sharp.  Maybe need to adjust setting.
2417,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Overall an excellent phone for the price with some nice features that exceed the price tag. Phone is very similar to other phones classified as mid end phones.The box comes with a charger, USB type C cable, pre-installed screen protector and phone case. The phone has a good macro camera with a screen that exceeded my expectations for the price tag. Also the 6GB of RAM and the ability to lock apps makes it really easy to multi task. There are 2 key features that exceed the price tag of this phone. First, NFC which is something I need in any phone in order to use Google Pay or scan my house and car keys. Second, the Smart Key which is an extra button on the left side of the phone which is also customizable (see pics).Cons:The single speaker is loud enough but coumd be a little more clear."
2418,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The Umidigi F3s runs lag free, The battery is exceptional, it gives me about a day and a half of use, The camera takes vibrant and well detailed photos, the phone display is bright and good at it's price point. There is 6gb ROM and 128gb of RAM enough storage for all your apps, photos, videos and music. I also like the fact that it's dual sim. Overall it's a great phone at it's price point making it well worth the money."
2419,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Everything good, maden with care, packed with accessories and most handy: 3 in 1 programmable button I use for telegram, teams and flashlight."

Â It's hard to find a reasonably priced phone with good features, but this one seems to come through in a lot of areas while still keeping the price pretty low. 128 GB storage, 6 GB ram, 5,000+ mAh battery... It's hard to complain about this phone! The multifunction button is the cherry on top for this new budget offering from Umidigi."
2421,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Nice product with good capture and navigation.
2422,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I pick this phone and was told it works on the Verizon network. But it doesn't.
2423,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I have had it with my Umidigi Power 3 phone! I absolutely will never buy another product from them. From the first it did NOT work as it should on the most basic of functions of a cell phone---making a phone call! (the sound was barely audible on phone calls even at highest level with using speaker I had to yell at all times when making a call). This occurred as soon as I activated this phone. The screen then cracked shortly thereafter from a very SMALL drop of say 3 feet from my back pocket onto the kitchen floor (linoleum tile). I got my money back though. Maybe their newer phones are better...but I just wish someone warned me about Umidigi cell phones as I researched and believed the hype....what do I have now? a motorola and it too is a brand I will never buy again... its got a bad chip issue which makes ghost calls and the  ringer works only when it wants to.....

2438,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Update: 4g stopped connecting and their customer support is a joke. First impossible to contact then impossible to get any answers.Considering prices inflation these days, you will be having a very hard finding a phone that cam do pretty much everything a top liner would do. The price starts at 240$ tax so imagine when they are on a promotion, the price would be even better.First of all the design is beautiful, I mean the colors and the glass back panel. I am not a big fan of iphone like cameras arrangement but that is fine. The front screen has just a small dot on top which serves as a camera.Some people complain about connectivity when they insert a sim card but I havent experiences anything similar. I would suggest to read the manual carefully and contact the seller, I am pretty sure it could be figures out.The fund works as a charm, it has a prety good battery capacity and it allows it to last for around whole day. Depending on usage of course. The camera doesnt take the best shots but they are still decent. Remember the price and lower your expectations. It allows you to surf internet, play games, do your work, listen to music, study, etc. And all that with ease"
2439,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The overall design of the phone is really good. I bought the blue version and it's as in the picture. The phone came in a yellow box with a cable, adapter and papers (also a sim card remover).The phone itself is really powerful because it never lags. it has 6 gb ram and a lot of storage (128gb).As you can also see in the pictures the camera is really good, it takes realistic photos and especially with vif colors.Finally the battery serve well because it's quite big (5150 mah).The phone has also nfc which is great.In short, it's a good phone for pretty much anything : gaming, social networks, youtube, photo shooting..."

2446,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"My wife needed a new phone, as hers was acting up and being unreliable. So I came across this brand, as I remember reading good things about the brand, and reading many reviews and studying the specs. On paper this seems to be a good phone, much better than the Motorola one that my wife wanted to get from Costco for $200. After researching the phone for a while, I decided to order it and give it a try, shipping was fast and arrived the next evening. Opened the box, set up the phone, transfering everything over from the old phone was a breeze. That's where it stopped being a great phone. It couldn't stay connected to WiFi, constantly disconnected without my wife noticing this caused her to go way over her mobile data limit and resulted in a nice extra on the phone bill. Next, call quality was very bad, person on the other end of phone would hear a computerized like voice, with constant cut outs making calls and conversations hard to have. Lastly the camera which is supposed to be 48MP was very grainy/blurry, and the zoom was only 2x which make the picture quality worse.It's too bad since it is a very nice looking phone, maybe I got a lemon, but maybe not. Anyways I returned it after a week of using it without any issues with the return. Didn't want to take a chance and exchange it for another unit."
2447,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,No complaints so far.
2448,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"UMIDIGI F3SI spotted this phone and was impressed with the specs to price point.It has a 48 MP camera on the back which takes really nice pictures. I haven't had a chance to take any night pics yet but think that will be good as well. The front camera takes nice selfie pics as wellAndroid 11, lots of internal storage and a spot for an SD card as well.It also has a second sim slot which will come in handy on the next trip down south.I am writing this review on the phone right now and the screen is nice and sharp.I am looking forward to using this as my daily driver."

2450,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Overall, definitely a phone worth it's price. It has good storage and RAM, great battery life, and the 48 mp camera is fantastic. The phone is slimmer and longer than some other phones, allowing it to fit better within my hand, without losing any screen size. The package includes not only the phone, but a simple clear case and a charger (USB Type-C). My one slight problem is some of the UI preferences that I have not been able change to my liking, but I will get used to those over time. As always, UMIDIGI has given me a phone that I very much enjoy with a very affordable price."
2451,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"So far I love it! Very smooth, very fast.  Light weight but not too light where it feels plastic. Audio is good, very clear. Could have a little more bass but not complaining. Pictures are actually excellent. I'm comparing them to my iphone 12 Pro. I'll see how the battery life is but so far its good too. The next thing I would hope to see is wireless charging for this. Comes with its own phone case. But overall, this is an amazing phone for a great price."
2452,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Jâ€™ai commander ce Umidigi comme telephone de backup, mais il mâ€™as beaucoup surpris. Performance / prix trÃ¨s intÃ©ressant. Sont seul point faible est la qualitÃ© des photos. Fonctionnel, mais loin dâ€™un iPhone. Jâ€™en suis satisfait et je recommande!"
2453,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I bought one of these in August and like it so much that I bought my wife one. Great camera on it. It holds a lot of apps and runs all of them great. Lots of memory in it too. I would put it up against other phones that are in the 500-600 dollar range..
2454,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The F3S with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage is a nice step up from the A13S I was previously using. The apps are snappier, able to handle more open apps at once.I know this is a cost effective phone, but my only drawback is the slow response of the screen. You can see the refresh rate while scrolling through facebook and Instagram, but I'm also spoiled with my Pixel 6. The screen is bright, the face unlock is great.I noticed that this F3S supports dual sim, but you have to sacrifice the microSD slot, where as the A13S has both sims and a MicroSD. But with the 128GB you likely won't need the SD anyway.The camera is much better, with the Sony 48MP lens. Still a bit of a lag between button press and shutter though.Again, comes with a silicon case and screen protector pre-installed. Love this.All in all a decent phone. I would recommend."

Camera is amazing. Even though the battery is not as long lasting and quick charging as my Moto Power was, it's still more than sufficient. The speaker is so powerful, it actually can vibrate at highest level. Fingerprint sensor is snappy too. I didn't realize how aged my over 3 year phone was getting until I got this phone."

2470,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"This phone basically needs to be plugged in at all times with the ""recommended charger"" that is 4 feet long.  Next to my Moto G Power i previously had this thing is bad.  it will take over 3 hours to do a full charge IF you do not use it AT ALL.  My previous phone i could go all day on a charge, but left in my bag and texting occasionally while listening to music i will burn through 50% of my battery in 2 hours or less.The camera is also not great.  I hope you have good lighting if you want to use the 50MP camera, because that's the only way you'll get quality shots with it.The only thing i do like is the fingerprint reader. That's okay.  Beyond that not so much."
2471,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I have a Moto G Stylus phone that's probably a few years old now and I love it! However, now it will only charge when the phone is turned off and the charger is plugged in then turned on. Kind of inconvenient. And the internal space is full. So, decided to upgrade to the 2022 version of the same type. NOT the 5g, just the same version.This one is horrible! I don't know if I got one that was used with problems and was sold to me as NEW or what, but the phone I got does NOT turbo charge on the cable that came with it. It takes at least 8 hours to charge fully!! Also, larger files won't send over texts like my older phone. For example, a screen shot. My old phone, no big deal! This phone, it goes in perpetual send.... and it never sends. Or if my text is 3 paragraphs.... nope! Not gonna send!  Let's talk about Voice Mail. Maybe I'm spoiled with my last phone? But my older version, all I had to do was put my phone down, turn the speaker on and push the play button and I could hear my messages. If I wanted to erase, I pushed the trash can. This phone I have to dial *86 to get into my mail box, THEN type my password then listen, then type 7 or 9.... blah blah blah... yeah, I know, I'm spoiled with my OLD phone, but shouldn't the new phone be better than the old one? Just sayin'! Ok, speech to text only works on texting. It won't work doing any other program.  So if I want to.... oh let's say write an Amazon review by talking it out, it just sits there waiting for me to talk, but when I talk it types nothing! I have to type it out. I'm spoiled again. Also the backlighting on the phone gets brighter and dimmer on it's own for no reason when the light in the room hasn't changed and the option on the phone is off for Adaptive Brightness!I've only had this phone for less than one week and these are the things I've discovered already. At first I was going to live with it. But now I'm thinking.... no!These are MY opinions. You are endtitled to yours and I am entitled to mine! And I am returning this phone!"
2472,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"Ordered this Moto G Stylus 2022 in both the blue and the pink mid October 2022. They both showed up with half charged batteries. No worries, right? Just a quick charge to get the batteries to full and then start porting SIM card # info.Welp.The blue Moto took about an hour to get to full. The pink took over 5 hours. And never got to more than 92%. Yikes.So, I'll admit, I am an iPhone snob. These Moto's were intended for my two pre-teen children in an attempt to save $ over iPhone. Apparently Motorola must've known these phones were for children b/c they decided the phones had to have Tictok, Facebook, and a bunch of other garbage apps download upon initial activation. No biggee, right?Welp.So, we're coming from a Mint Mobile family plan. You must activate the SIM cards using the Mint mobile app; there is not other way to activate the phone. So I turn off the auto-download of all the garbage apps so I can get the Mint mobile app to do the single thing I care about doing. Nope. Immediately after cancelling the auto-download app downloads, the phones would immediately recommence downloading the garbage apps. Unreal. Is this a universal Android thing, or did I just have too high expectations for cheapo entry-level Android devices. So now I can't get the single app I need to make this phone an actual phone until all the other garbage downloads. Sheeesh.Sent them both back. Had to spend 2-3x more to get my kids into low-end iPhones, but at least I won't have to concern myself with bricked batteries and Tictok overriding my druthers on my children's phones.There were a number of other shortcomings as well, but not worth any more of my time in telling all of you that you should prob stay away from these devices if time, patience, value, and frictionless phone experiences are something you are seeking."

2474,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I'm very happy with this purchase. My old phone started not working after I dropped it and unexpectedly had to buy this one. I love the stylus that comes with it and the phone is a little bigger than I imagined which is great! The only thing is I'm a delivery driver for Uber Eats so my battery gets wasted faster than the 2days as advertised, but that was to be expected. In reality the battery does good for me, alot better than my old iphone."
2475,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"Has WiFi connection issues, even after updates and network resets. Runs very slow on WiFi as well. Really sad cause I really wanted to love this phone"
2476,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,I bought this phone to replace my older Samsung galaxy note cell. I was a little nervous thinking I would not get all the features I liked. I absolutely love this new phone. Has a lot of features and easy to set up and use. I saved hundreds of dollars compared to buying a Samsung product. This is a no brainer for the money and functionality .
2477,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,Great phone. Especially once the price is considered. Camera is one of the better phone cameras I've had. Accurate color reproduction
2478,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I generally like Motorola but battery life on this phone really stinks. The rest of the phone is fine. That being said, my last Motorola lasted a year, the charging port broke. Might be time to look at other options."
2479,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,Well worth it
2480,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I had the 2020 model for the last two years, after it started running sluggish I decided to make the upgrade. Not only was the phone barely faster than my current phone but the camera was significantly worse, the battery was complete garbage, and the speaker was terrible. I can't even begin to tell you how bad the sound experience was with this device; not only does it only use ONE speaker but it fluctuates wildly in terms of loudness. Almost every other video I watched I had to adjust the volume substantially from 5 all the way to 10 then back down to 4. The fact that a bran new phone can barely run faster than my sluggish 2 year old model is horrible.Now the one good thing I will say about the phone is I actually did really like the fingerprint sensor (power button) but I'm not spending this kind of money for an upgraded fingerprint sensor when everything else is worse; especially when if I keep my current phone it's FREE."
2481,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,I like this phone. It's great for the price paid.

It works for the most part, but has little things here and there. It freezes all the time whether I'm playing a game to texting. I can't turn off my notification sound unless I turn off my ringtone for recieving calls and texts. They should be two separate things in settings. The battery life is good so far. It is only 4g not 5g. The camera quality is good for the most part, the camera facing me is not great. Overall, easy to use, but has it's downfalls."

2488,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"The phone itself is amazing! There was nothing wrong with it, no scratches, seems to be brand new! The problem is that the phone is not unlocked and is not recognized in the Boost Mobile system! So if you're a boost mobile customer, I would not purchase this phone!"
2489,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I was very excited when I got the phone. It had a cute casing of the phone itself, especially the stylus was very easy to locate. Camera quality is very good. Although the only issue was that when I went to charge it so I can switch my old device over to the new one they had informed me that this phone didn't accept boost. So ultimately I had to return it, and look for a different one."
2490,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,I didn't like discovering that this phone was not a 5g phone. Beware buyers when you change the color on a cell phone it can switch you to a different phone. Now I am pass the replacement time frameğŸ¤”ğŸ˜®ğŸ˜
2491,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,I bought two of them and both have the same issue. When you call they have a constant noise. I rebooted several times and the problem still there. Very disappointed. I don't recommend it.
2492,Motorola,Moto G Stylus,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.8 Inches,"I ordered the Metallic Rose, which looks like a nice silver. I needed to replace my 2021 Stylus, and took the chance on getting this. So far this performs just as good as the 2021, I can't really notice much difference. All my apps load fast, everything works good. Call quality is good and clear. The speaker sounds good and loud. Battery life is really good, you can get two to three days on it depending on your usage. The camera is surprisingly good, I didn't think it would be as good as it is. I think it's better than the 2021 Stylus. I  haven't taken any video, I do know theres no 4k. I also haven't used the stylus so I can't say much about it, but it's nice to have. If you can't afford an Samsung or iPhone, I'd recommend this phone."

However, it's fine.This is the second one I got, had to return the first one within the 30 day period.  Know that some have screen glitches that aren't going to go away.

2499,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"IF ""fully unlocked,"" ALSO, means, Sprint-only and No Us Cellular usability; then sure, it's fully unlocked. I should send this back, but since that's more trouble than it's worth, I'm going to go ahead and give it to someone already with Sprint. The phone itself is great. BUT ""fully unlocked"" was not true at all. US Cellular IS a major company to which this phone should have been accessible. It was they who politely let me know that this phone is NOT fully unlocked. Shameful, if this was done knowingly."
2500,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"Overall the outside of the phone is spotless, might as well be brand new. The only issue I can find is a small amount of screen burn in. Only noticeable when screen is a bright white."
2501,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"It's good especially for the price. The moto g stylus is selling for like the same price as this but when I got that ""budget"" phone it lagged and froze up far too much. This is superior in processing power. And of course it is. It's an S10. It's 3 years old granted.  But specs don't lie, which is why this was such a good deal. The battery life I would say is average. Not super great but not super bad either. It's doable. The fingerprint reader is actually not as good as the moto g fast I had, which had an indent for accuracy of use. With this phone I can't unlock it with my fingerprint without looking at it, but there's no ergonomic clue that my thumb is where it should be. If the fingerprint sensor was at least right below the power button that would make it more intuitive. Games have input lag which I was surprised by. I think I can fix that with a booster but I doubt it will fix the slow response on the screen during gameplay. I didn't get the phone just for gaming though. The phone processes everything else nice and fast. No freezes when opening or switching from app to app. Everything is smooth, and the 6.1"" display is not overly large so I can type with one hand if I had to. It's ok for daily use in almost everything except gaming. The main boxes I wanted to check were the convenience and freedom that android offers such as simple drag and drop file transfer from my computer, processing speed, reliabilitywith apps. and a headphone jack. This model has a headphone jack, so now I can listen to music while charging the phone. However I noticed a great delay when I want to pausey music using the control button on my wired headphones. Sometimes the music just doesn't pause at all, and that's annoying, because I need to pause the music immediately so I can hear my environment and talk to people in it. If the fingerprint, input lag, and music pause faulty issue were optimized, this would be that much closer to a 5 star phone.  I'll probably still keep this phone if I upgrade to the S20 simply because of the convenience of the old-school headphone jack. Sadly, Samsung got rid of it on the S20, and didn't bother to optimize the fingerprint scanner either. So if this S10 breaks, I'll probably just get another S10."
2502,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,So far no issues didn't appear to have any noticeable scratches or cosmetic issues and the only issue I had was that switching devices was sick a simply process I spent a couple days thinking I had to do through the usual activation always an ordeal that never is resolved on the first attempt so success often only comes after multiple attempts/days of frustration that I assumed was inevitable so 2 failed attempts over a 2 day period ended when I simply put my sim card into the new unlocked phonejust to see what happened as I was certain that I needed to get a new sim card from my service provider and eff me the whole time I simply had to transfer the Sim from my old device to the new unlocked one
2503,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,Great so far came fast with zero signs of wear and is like buying a new phone works with cricket just fine and runs like brand new and is so easy to back up from my old phone
2504,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"I bought the S10 to replace an aging S8 with a cracked screen that had to be recharged several times a day. I looked at new Samsung phones but they were super expensive and missing some of the features I wanted like the MicroSD slot andmicrophone jack. I was a little worried that the ""new"" phone might be less than newish, but I ordered it anyway.  To my delight, it arrived very quickly and was absolutely perfect! Not a scratch anywhere or any signs of use. It was packaged in a new-looking S10 box complete with all chargers and cords wrapped ""factory fresh"".  I was able to set it up myself and am delighted with it. I ordered a 256G SD card to go in it, so I have all the memory I should ever need.I don't use or like face recognition or fingerprint readers, so I can't comment on that. I use my phone A LOT, so the battery life is OK, better than my S8 anyway. I have several supplemental chargers that I keep handy, so recharging isn't a big problem and I can continue to use my phone while it's charging. I kept the S8 and can still do all my internet stuff on it, so the S10 is my contact phone primarily, but I still find myself using both phones for browsing.All in all, this was a perfect experience and I saved a ton of money over the cost of a new phone. Couldn't be happier!"
2505,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,I was supposed to trade my phone for the one I boughtWas told to do it after I got my new phone. Now I'm wondering if I missed out on the whole thing. I love this phone. Do everything else needs. And it's not complicated. Second S10 I've bought and not sure if I would want anything else.
2506,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,All seems well so far. Scratch free yes. It keeps on asking for installing update tho. Not sure tht is because no Sim card is present.
2507,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,telÃ©fono como nuevo!
2508,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"Device appeared to be in ""as-new"" condition. Easily recognized my carrier as soon as SIM card was installed. Device works as expected. (Bought to replace wife's damaged S9)"
2509,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,No issues.
2510,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"This is a really nice phone.There are no visible blemishes and the battery life while I have been setting it all up is OK, no more, no less.It comes with a very cheap charging cable which looks like it will need replacing soon but I had zero expectations on that front.The only thing I really dislike is the T-Mobile programs on it that keep asking me to update them even though I have disabled them all.I will have to find a way to rid the phone of those."
2511,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"What I liked:1) The phone looks new2) Worked as expected.3) Battery is good for moderate use.4) Pbotos are good5) Running on Andriod 12After 90 days, still working as expected.Overall, value for money."
2512,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,Phone function perfectly! Especially love the camera! I believe that Samsung S series have the best cameras for the price!I do needed to go to T-Mobile get a new SIM card for this phone to able to recognize the network since my old SIM was sprint to T-Mobile.
2513,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"Fortunately, the scratches are at the back of the phone, below the edge of the camera protrusion."
2514,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,Came as expected
2515,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,This is my personal phone as well being used for word with a Google voice phone number. The description said that the batter life was good for three days not so. The phone is definitely worth what I paid especially with features my old phone did not have. The long and short I really enjoy learning my new phone.
2516,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,EstÃ¡ en perfecto estado funciona muy bien
2517,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"I rated 3 stars overall as the phone is a great buy and in mint condition however the charging cable is either faulty/damaged or not original. Phone battery came on 1% when charger was connected a screen pop up appeared stating ""slow charging"" and to ensure I use supported charger or to ensure it's not damaged. Also when charging battery percentage goes down and not up as long as phone is on and in use. Guess I'll have to go purchase a charger :("
2518,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"Very fast delivery and phone as described, clean, functional and ready to use."
2519,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,This phone came in perfect condition.  I have had no problems with it and the price was right.  Thank you
2520,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,If you looking for a snapy and fast phone its a must buy. But if you buying it renewed please check with seller about the battery health because the one i got was not that great. Other than that a great phone for the money i paid. Would last 1-2 years according to me.
2521,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,Good product despite some initial problem. All resolved after resetting again!
2522,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,I really like the camera!
2523,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"after 10 days it fell from 27inches and now all I see is 25% of only the top of the screen and a nice shatter glass. Nice speed and was getting use to it, but it didn't have all the convenience and options of my S5. Too much app (Google/Samsung external storage) control and not enough in house user on phone options/privacy (if privacy is even a thing anymore). Back to using my beat up S5, not as fast or pretty, but has been going for me since 2016 with numerous drops along the way. The S10 is very slippery\smooth that if I put my S5 on top it would slide of of a flat surface hence, it fell on its own and shattered quite easily."
2524,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"At the beach I accidentally walked into the ocean with my beloved S10+. As it's battery had been previously replaced, the water resistance of the device was compromised and the salt water proceeded to make my girl inoperable. I quickly found this S10 renewed device and for the price it was a no brainer. I wanted to upgrade to the S23 when it comes out and this S10 will get me there perfectly fine. It came exactly as described and in perfect shape. No scuffs, etc. For less than $200 this S10 can be had that outclasses any new phone in this price point. Excellent purchase and would do again in a heartbeat."
2525,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"Fedex from New York to montana.  Ordered friday morning, they estimated wednesday arrival.  arrived tuesday a day early.  2nd surprise was it truly did look brand new.  Transferring data from old phone was smooth but the new s10 got quite warm while doing that and i thought uh-oh but continued.  Put sim card from old samsung s9 to 'new' s10, called the new phone and it worked perfect, never had to contact verizon at all.  phone has never heated up again, everything works perfect, highly recommend.  I read the negative reviews and am sure they were probably true problems, however i was never worried, am sure they would have made it right if happened to get a bad one."
2526,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"It was in excellent shape, I would have loved to have kept it but would not work on visible network."
2527,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"I've had this refurbished like new galaxy s10 for a few months now. Wow it's pretty much a new phone,  super fast and great battery life. Highly recommend if your trying to save a little $ and still get a great phone."
2528,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,The phone looks like it was well taken care of cosmetically. The issue here is that the battery life is below average. More transparency would have been great for this purchase.
2529,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,Mi sobrino quedÃ³ encantado
2530,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,
2531,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"Basically what i expected is what i got. I've previously bought a Samsung galaxy s10 (refurbished) and this one had some light scratches on the screen but as it states you cannot really see them at arms length.  So I am very happy with what i got. batter life seems to be normal aswell ( not rundown). The back had absolutely no marks or scuffs, very pleased ."
2532,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,The used phone was I. Good condition
2533,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,I like  this  phone.  Fast delivery.  Looks like  new  and works  with werizzon wireless.  Excellent condition and excellent  battery life.
2534,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,Yes
2535,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"Llego puntual. El sistema es bueno, lo uso solamente con Wi fi, ya q no me lee el chip."
2536,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"I ended up ordering two of these phones in different colors. I'm leaving a review for both because it was such a great deal. I usually look for a budget phones within this price range, and I had no idea that Amazon offered premium phones for a reasonable price.Getting these phones at this price and to have them look totally brand new is amazing!  I also love the fact that you can have protection plans on these phones just in case something happens. If you buy the same phone from another retailer or online service, they don't offer protection plans because of the conditions of the phone. Thank you very much to Amazon and the seller for offering these premium phones at an affordable price."
2537,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,This phone was so worth  the money I needed a new phone anyway. I'm so happy with it im so happy with it. I had the phone for two months and no problems .
2538,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"Nada de que quejarme, el celular pasa por nuevo, mirando muy de cerca, se ve alguna leve raya en la tapa, pero en general impecable. Es la primera ves que compro un telÃ©fono asÃ­, lo compre con bastante miedo porque soy de Uruguay y una devoluciÃ³n no me era viable."
2539,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"The battery seems good, charges fast. The phone itself had 1 corner that the color coating was chipped a little but once the case was put on you can't see it."
2540,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"If I didn't know better, I would of mistaken it as a new phone sent to me by mistake. Excellent referbish company. Not one scratch, not one ding, and most important, a very happy customer! I had my first galaxy S7 for 8 years, the transfer was 15min using smart switch. Now the S10 is a upgrade and all my settings and apps are their for me. Thanks Amazon, Samsung, and the referbishing company. Best purchase made."
2541,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"Sadly this phone looked nice but the battery drained faster than my old phone that I was replacing, therefore this seller is not honest, when I asked to return the phone they sent me an unpaid shipping label, not cool, I would not buy from this company again, and I will ask Amazon to refund me the shipping,"
2542,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"STATED ""FULLY UNLOCKED"".  IT WAS NOT.  DOES NOT CONNECT ON ""CONSUMER CELLULAR""."
2543,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"Now that its set up, great phone. No issues, just a couple minor scuffs. No big deal though . Im through Straight talk and just switched the sim right over . Just had to pause and update phone 4 times (or until back up to date) before it could finish switching, and finally make calls. Didn't even need a representative though."
2544,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,Chargers do not work
2545,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"Evidently this is NOT unlocked. Caution. If you think it is, wait till you get it. Tracfone had both ATT and Verizon type SIM card, so I got that. On booting, it says ""VERIZON"" ... that was a big clue that it was not unlocked.I'd like to get $40 back for their ""Unlocked"" lie. I figure that's how much extra trouble this thing was."
2546,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"Love the camera on this phone!! That is one of the main reasons I bought it. The picture of the flower was taken with the S10. Crisp and clear! If your thinking about purchasing this phone, buy it from this company!! High quality phone that works for an affordable price!"
2547,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"Wow, Like NEW! So far so good. Excellent!!"
2548,SAMSUNG,S10,128 GB,Android,6.1 Inches,"Id love for the battery to last longer. I dont do alot with my phone just face book and of course search and shoping on amazon, making and recieving calls and email. I have battery aving mode on and i believe its helped alot. Thanks."
2549,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,"This is below the sweet spot for Budget phones The Sweet spot is around 100 to 120 dollars, if you can't spend that I advise finding something used that has software support a lot of the pixel phones do.My phone broke and I needed a replacement almost instantly, but I was short on cash so this is the purpose I used this phone for. I didn't have much money I needed something to get me through a pinch that was available with next day shipping.This phone is truly awful, it doesn't even run the basic apps that came on it well like web browser and calendar, it does its best impersonation of that sloth from zootopia opening these strips down barebones version of Google maps and Google Assistant.If you need a phone for an elderly person I would avoid it would be very frustrating, as you push something and nothing happens for a good 3 seconds.If you need a cell phone for your kid I also would avoid unless you hate them.The operating system has not been updated or maintained as far as I can tell for very long past when this thing was a new product.This only works on CDMA networks, which I think is pretty clear but I see other reviewers complaining that it doesn't work on verizon, just look up if your network is CDMA or GSM if it's GSM you're probably fine if it's CDMA run for the hills aaI would recommend this when you have exactly $60, and need a Android phone tomorrow to get you through in a pinch."
2550,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,"I ordered this to work with a client at school that had Autism. I turn the Bluetooth on and downloaded a microphone app. I can connect the Bluetooth to his headphones and talk to him through the phone without interrupting class. The phone was a little difficult to get set up and it didnâ€™t like my mobile hotspot, but once it connected to regular wifi, it worked great!"
2551,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,I have a QLink sim card and it's not compatible with this phone. I don't think this phone was unlocked because it should have connected to the network and it didn't .
2552,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,It was a great phone I just couldnâ€™t use it.it was incompatible with what I needed
2553,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,The picture quality is so so poor. One of the sim card slot doesn't work at all. I wasted my money for sure.
2554,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,Good for trap phone not for every day. Use really bad quality to be honest but great to make calls in case of emergencies.
2555,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,Bought for my almost 13yr old son. It's decent for the price as a beginner phone.
2556,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,Says unlocked and states it works with MetroPCS but when received I tried toset it up and it was not compatible

2564,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,started acting up second day
2565,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,"I donâ€™t know if I just got a bad phone or if itâ€™s this phone in general but it sucks. I ordered it for my younger brother to have a little first phone to see how he would do with it and everything was going well until it wasnâ€™t. The service kept going out. And it was the sim card or anything cause everything I got for it was brand new and it still wasnâ€™t working and then I went to return it and I selected the option to have ups come pick it up and return it for me and they didnâ€™t even show up. Like how you gonna have it an option and then they not come? I am a big Amazon fan, I even ordered my iPhone from Amazon and Iâ€™ve had it for a year no problems at all but this one here is not worth the money or the frustration trust me."

2567,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,Phone might have been ok but couldn't use it because it wasn't compatible with server like it said it should be !
2568,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,"I had real problems with this phone.  The SIMM slot is large enough that the SIMM fits is many different orientations, only one of which works.  The manual had cryptic instructions in tiny print.  Even when I got the sim installed correctly, the phone never performed reliably and network connections were far worse than other phones.I don't know if I got a dud or if I got what I paid for, but this one went back to Amazon -- thank goodness for a generous return policy."
2569,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,"Didn't expect a lot, but won't even take a charge. RETURNING without chance to turn it on"

2571,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,My plan is metro pcs and they told me this phone is locked. Theyâ€™re selling  as an unlocked phone. Very hard to take off back to put in battery

2573,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,Could not use the phone. It needs a chip to run the phone and my chip for service. Didnt know how to acquire the chip for the phone so sent it back in Aug.No refund yet.

2576,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,"Purchased so my son could call me from the bus stop. Fast shipping w/in 24hrs, but DOA.

2577,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,"Bought this for granddaughter, went to wireless provider which couldnâ€™t activate went to another provider couldnâ€™t activate do it being locked"
2578,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,The phone is a good on the go phone when you just need a phone just in case . It lags . It takes a long while to charge. Other than that it's a cool phone.  It's not like an update phone but good on the go
2579,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,"Very bad display, battery and freezing all the time"

2582,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,Liked it
2583,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,The phone only worked for 3weeks after that it kept glitching an doing its own thing so would recommend.
2584,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,Purchased to use as a burner phone while abroad.  I cant say if this phone is crap but I can say it was DOA. I suppose it is better it not function from day one than have it go out while I am stranded somewhere
2585,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,This phone doesn't work with any sim card. Don't waste your money.
2586,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,Returned would not allow me to install Sim card
2587,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,Bought because it said it was unlocked and it wasn't. I went through hell trying to get it to work with my mobile network.
2588,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,This product didnâ€™t work here for me in the US due to it being in a 3g network

2596,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,Phone is locked. IMEI does not come up in any cell providers network. I am not sure how that happened. This is a scam!!!!!!!  I want a full refund ASAP!
2597,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,"Stupid. Says all carriers, but in small print it says not Verizon. Donâ€™t say all carriers if itâ€™s not all carriers. Now I have to go through the haste of retuning it"
2598,BLU,C5,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,I've yet to actually use it other then a paper weight. I'm not sure what I will do next.
2599,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"This phone is actually smaller that my original and I had a little trouble with it at first because it wouldn't download apps for some reason when I first tried on the first day that I had it, it just kept saying ""installing app"" for hours with no progress. So the next day I was going to send it back and so I filled out the return forms,  but I just kept trying to download several different apps from Google play store and finally WahLah!!! It started working and I haven't had any problems since. But the touch screen is very sensitive and the screen cracked with in the first three days that I had it even though I was careful, I think it was in my pocket. It did not come with a screen protector or a protective case so I recommend that you order both at the same time. Just remember if you're ordering a new case that this Galaxy s9 ended up being smaller than my original Galaxy s9 so my old protector case would not fit so before you order a new case make sure you take measurements to see that it fits properly . But over all I'm satisfied with this product. And shipping was prompt. I hope this helps. Have a great day."
2600,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"Why would you put sticker directly on the back of the phone with no protection under it, this has been an awful experience, between having to chase UPS Drive down and tell him to hand over my phone because he didnâ€™t leave it on my back porch, but around 4 hours later finally able to sit down and transfer phone after I cleaned the ticker off the back needless to say works with cricket so far so good 4 stars"
2601,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"Bought 2 of phones. One didn't work at all and only the phone was in the box no charger cable. I was reimbursed half the price of pne phone. And now, just a few weeks after the second phone stopped working. Very disappointed."

2606,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"I have purchased multiple Samsung Galaxy S9 phones (kids.. nothing else needs to be said). I bought a replacement phone for my teen who had dropped theirs. They didn't immediately switch their phone information over, so I received the lowdown just a couple of days ago. Apparently the volume up button doesn't work and it's problematic for certain apps, etc.I'm annoyed that I wasn't aware of this, but even more so that it's an expensive purchase and this is a waste of my money.Again, Samsung phones in and of themselves are great! This phone just had flaws though and it was sold to me under the pretense that it worked as it should. I'm disappointed."
2607,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"Nice phone very clean, came as advertised."
2608,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,We purchase this phone renewed and it is still working great.
2609,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"had a few issues with getting a phone with a broken screen at first, 2nd one has worked good tho other than a charging problem that happened for a couple of days. That part is on samsung tho"
2610,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,It serves it's purpose
2611,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"phone works great, looks brand new. easy setup."
2612,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"Good phone, might scratch easy so get good screen protector. Fragile buttons though. Wish it had some more space but thats a regular issue"
2613,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,Lo comprÃ© para mi mamÃ¡ que vive en Cuba.
2614,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,I may get another galaxy soon
2615,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"Fingerprint reader,battery and screen all in excellent condition. Def will order all my phones from here!!"
2616,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,look like new fully funcional
2617,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"When I was looking to purchase a Samsung Galaxy S9 one key think I was looking for was for it to be carrier unlocked, with that in mine I found this listing, in which the phone was said to be unlocked in the listing title. This is false. After retrieving the phone and booting it up it can be clearly said that it isn't carrier unlocked as it shows the typical Verizon boot animation. The phone I received has no visible marks are scratches however, so I say this product is 4/5."
2618,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,Great description.
2619,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"Yo ordene dos de ellos y la verdad me gustaron uno llego como lo queria todo perfecto, pero el otro llego con pequeÃ±os rayasos en la pantalla y yo lo compre completamente renovado que se supone que no este con esas marcas."
2620,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,I love my new phone igreat
2621,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"No issue charging (came partially charged) and setting up 2 of these phones. Easy to put in the Mint Mobile SIM card with the provided tool and Samsung video. We already own Samsung Galaxy S8 and S9 phones, so there's no learning curve, which probably helps.  Only took about 10-15 minutes for a new number, and approximately 30 minutes to set up and copy an existing phone.  I usually dread setting up new phones, so this was all a pleasant surprise and relief. Hoping they have a good lifespan."
2622,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"when on a call, when I lift the phone to my ear to actually talk to someone, the audio completely cuts out. if I hold the phone vertical, it works fine. But when it is lifted to my ear, to use it as a phone(because that's what it is) all audio stops and I can't hear the person talking to me. I've restarted, installed updated, and closed all other apps. Still, whenever the phone is lifted, the audio is gone. I can even lift and lower and lift the phone like I'm expertizing with a dumbell, and the sound just goes in and out and in and out."
2623,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,This phone is like a cheap Rolex knockoff. The software is CLONED. It Will NOT Work. Can't receive or send calls. Can only intermittently text IF the phone allows it. This seller is selling Cheap Junk. NOT the Flagship os Samsung.
2624,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"So I used to have a Samsung S9 a few years ago and when I switched carriers I gave my old one to our 10-year-old and this one is still working great. When my husband needed a new phone on our new carrier we didn't want to spend a lot of money or need the latest and greatest phone. He liked the S9 so we ordered one for myself and him to replace other devices. Well...these 2 performed so poorly that they both got sent back. One didn't work with getting on the network because although it said 4G I got a 2G phone (3G isn't even online anymore!), as for his phone, the battery all of a sudden won't hold a charge and dies immediately off a charger. This is annoying especially for him since he doesn't have a desk job. Totally disappointed."
2625,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,Great phone
2626,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,The phone arrived with all accessories with only a minor dissolution on the back of the phone. The phone stays in a case so thats not an issue. It took a long time for the phone to completely update after several attempts. Since then the phone has worked great for my 9 yo that plays game and video calls all the time. The battery is pretty good. It seems to drain faster when lower than 25%. Overall this was a good purchase for us.
2627,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,Very nice beautiful
2628,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,I'm very pleased with the quality of the refurbished phone. There is a very tiny and completely superficial scuff on the screen but I can't even see it when it's turned on.I'm super happy with the price I paid to replace my cracked s9. (It would have cost me more to fix the screen on my old one.)
2629,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,No le agrado la pequeÃ±a rotura de la pantalla.
2630,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"works like a new cell, Absolutly perfect condition"
2631,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"The phone is used as advertised.  The battery life drains like nobody's business,  but given that I just came from owning a Nokia 2.4, I have absolutely nothing to complain about. Every phone is better than my previous one."
2632,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"Fully Unlocked as stated and everything works well, great buy."
2633,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"Was hesitant to order this as a replacement because I could not inspect it first. Had amazing experience with purchase. It arrived on time in better condition than I expected, will definitely buy again if need."
2634,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"En verdad salen muy buenos estos telÃ©fonos, a pesar de ser usados vienen en muy buenas condiciones y hasta ahora no he tenido ningÃºn problema con los que he comprado."
2635,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"This is my 3rd refurbished phone; I've had an S5 (that eventually died) and 2 S9s. I doubt I'll ever buy a brand new phone again.I had my first S9 for a couple of years but dropped it on rocks and broken the screen. I recently purchased the same one again- it's a great phone and I didn't feel the need to upgrade.The 2nd one is in excellent condition,  almost like new.  I put a better screen protector on this one (and made sure to change to touchscreen sensitivity so that isn't negatively impacted by the screen protector).With smart switch, it was easy to transfer everything over."
2636,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,Love it
2637,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,Phone doesn't work right. After 3 hours the battery starts to die. Can't receive messages but I can receive phone calls.
2638,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,cool
2639,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"Had a S6 for years. Wanted something close but an upgrade which hit on both of these.Also very satisfied (1 week) with the battery life and overall cosmetics. Being a 'refurb', I was concerned but it appears to be brand new."
2640,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,Bueana calidad
2641,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,It would have been nice to come with some basic instructions. It has so far been a good phone.
2642,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"The Galaxy s9 is a quality phone and everything operates smoothly, absolutely love using it! There are so many accessories available for the Samsung and that has been a huge plus also!"
2643,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"The screen is in new condition and with the exception of the fingerprint scanner, the rest of the phone looks great. The fingerprint scanner has chipped paint, obvious wear and does not work well. It will scan fingerprints to save, but I have never been successful opening apps with it.  I've started using iris and facial recognition as a workaround"
2644,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"Take pictures of the actual item you're selling  and is optional to us if we want it on that conditions or not.Lcd a lot of burn marks, I used to buy some with a lite burned marks but yours was way too much"
2645,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,Arrived damaged in front
2646,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,The color is amazing. Perfect hand fit
2647,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,"I am always wary of purchasing refurb items online without being able to check em out first. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the near mint condition of the Samsung s9 I received.Aside from a couple of very light, barely visible scratches there are no signs of wear and tear.The phone came with a charging/data cable, wall charger and wired earbuds.I am very happy with my purchase."
2648,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S9,64 GB,Android 8.0,5.8 Inches,excellent;  functioning smoothly.
2649,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I received the phone in pristine condition.  The phones were purchased for my wife and daughter since their phone's batteries were no longer up to par.  I plugged in the phones with the supplied charger and cable, and received an error message (See photo).  I used a spare charger and it worked fine.  I used the Samsung SmartSwitch program, but it was less than perfect.  I upgraded my daughters phone, and everything for the most part switched over.  But my wifes phone was another matter.  She had so many text messages, it could only transfer over 2 years worth of messaged.  Something in reference to her Galaxy S9 didn't have enough space on it to chache the transfer of data to the new phone.  The Passwords she had to either remember or reset.  As far as the error I received, it was promptly taken care of by the vendor.  I contacted them through Amazon, and they sent me replacement AC Adapters and they worked fine.  They did not give me any hassle.  I sent them a picture of the old Adapter to make sure they didn't send the same ones (both didn't work same model).  I will give an update if there are any issues."
2650,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Excellent. As advertised, phone in near-perfect condition. Easily transferred all my data from one Samsung Galaxy to the other using ""Smart Switch"" (on both phones). Went to my local Verizon store where they remove the SIM card from old phone and installed on the new. In the future I will need to return to Verizon to install 5G SIM, but for now I'm good to go."
2651,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Arrived in excellent condition. Definitely worth the price.
2652,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Needed to upgrade for vehicle app. Great choice.
2653,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Received it in pristine condition and is flawless! Saved hundreds of $$$ by buying from Amazon Renewed. Go for it!
2654,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Muy bueno aunque no decia que era de virazon y yo compre liberado
2655,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I've had the phone a few weeks now. Battery life is great, the phone looks brand new. I've seen a couple negative reviews from this seller so I was a bit skeptical, but the product I received was perfect. I would def  recommend refurbished phones to all my friends, it saves a LOT of money."
2656,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"NOTE - this is all about the manufacturer, not the seller.As a long time Galaxy S-series owner, I assumed any phone in the S lineup would be an upgrade from my old S8. And in many ways, this is. But if I'd read the specs in more detail, I'd have chosen a different model.The fixed-focus selfie camera means shots of more than 4 or 5 people are out of focus - no more propping up the phone and using the selfie camera so you can see the group, you'll want to use the main camera and frame carefully before starting the timer.WiFi management is awful - it's very reluctant to switch to a stronger signal, so if you walk up two floors it will struggle to hold on to the weak downstairs connection instead of switching to the strong signal of the floor you're on. I've never had a phone that made me manually switch WiFi connections so frequently.Still, the rest of the phone's features are what you'd expect from an S-series, and these defects aren't enough that I'm trading it in right away. Just going to be more careful next time."
2657,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Good phone. I'm not big on latest and greatest but it works fine. I would buy again
2658,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"USB-C power adapter included is broken, it is rated for 12W but only charging at 5W speed (7 hours for a complete charge!!!) instead of the 25W speed that comes with the original. This is not a fully functional accessory as described in on the store page.Sim tool was missing.Other than that, the phone seems to be in great condition and some screen protectors were included as a nice bonus. Minus a half star for the SIM tool missing and minus 1.5 Stars for selling me a broken adapter."
2659,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I recently bought this item and a few days ago the screen froze up.  I could not turn the phone off using the button on the side. It was like Bixby had taken over my phone. I could not find my pictures, the phone icons, nothing.  Finally, I was able to turn the phone off.  I turned it back on hours later, and it did the same thing.  If it happens a 3rd time, I am sending it back. I normally do not have issues with phones I buy from Amazon, and this one was not cheap. I don't know what happened, but it made it hard for me to do business on my phone."
2660,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I can't find anything to dislike about this transaction. The phone arrived quickly and was just like new.  The software and setup was just as if it were a totally new phone and was straightforward and easy. I read and watched a lot of reviews before deciding on the S20 FE and I am not disappointed as it performs up to the expectations I had. I put the SIM card in from my old Verizon Samsung S7 4G phone and it ran perfectly, picking up 5G when I'm in a 5G coverage area. I have since ordered the latest 5G SIM from Verizon (free) but don't expect any big change...just wanted to have the latest.  I am totally satisfied with this phone after about a month, and very satisfied with this vendor and the Amazon Renewed experience."
2661,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"So many options, but I was fortunate with this one. Upgraded from an S8plus so this was a huge upgrade. It's practically brand new. All the features are great. Battery life is really good. With the right case and glass protection, I am confident this one will last."
2662,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"The phone came from the seller on time. GREAT!!!!The phone came on a small white box. Inside the box I received the Phone, C Cable, Charger and key to remove the Sim Card.I took the phone to the Verizon store and the Customer Service Representative took the Sim Card from my old phone, installed it in the new phone and took about 15 minutes to activate it .He also transferred all my files  from the old phone to the new phone (that took 15 more minutes)  Everything done in 30 minutes.Now, is time to play with my new toy!!!!!"
2663,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Had a problem with the phone but the customer service was excellent.
2664,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"The phone came quickly,  wrapped, charged and ready to go."
2665,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I've taken my this phone into Verizon 3 time to see why it won't shut up. No one can figure it out. It says I have messages, all the time but I don't.  The only way to quiet the phone is to put it on mute. I finally ordered a new phone"
2666,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Me gusto
2667,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,This company sent me a cell phone with lots of problems from day one. I tried to deal with the phone dropping calls and static but over time got worse alone with a number of other problems. Return phone before return deadline with everything it came with and factory reset as instructed. Nothing was missing and was charged a restocking fee of $189.00 out of the $403 paid for the phone. It's a rip off. I contacted Amazon to complain about this and was told a manager would review my claim and return my call and its been a few weeks and have yet to hear back from anyone. I have tried to reach Amazon again but was unsuccessful. I was scammed.
2668,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Upgraded from an S8, and it is wonderful. If there were any blemishes, I couldn't find them. Battery life is the main reason I selected this model, and it did not disappoint. With active usage, I can still go 2 days between charges. It was easy too switch phones. Just swap the SIMs and run Samsung Smartwatch. Very happy all around."
2669,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Guys at the place that we bought from were as helpful as they could be but..... one NOT  unlocked phone unable to get authorized on my service and one phone that the screen died after 72 hrs was not a good advert for their service and in the end I bought a a53 new from best buy.
2670,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Works great. Setup was easy no problems. Just plug in the Sim card and everything was good.
2671,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"The screen flickers and appears to havvbve not been repaired properly. When I contacted the seller to return, they wanted me to return phone first before a replacement was sent. What a hassle to not be with a phone or have to transfer everything again. I would like to return but only if I am sent replacement first. Never received an answer when I made this request."
2672,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,I transferred my sim card from my s9 plus to the s20 fe. My number was immediately put on a fraud alert. Spent 2.5 hours on phone with Verizon to fix the fraud alert and get my old phone working with my number. The s20 I received when connected to Verizons network has a fraud alert tied to it and Verizon will not allow this phone on their network.
2673,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,excellent product and excellent customer service
2674,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,My daughter loveâ€™s this phone and said itâ€™s exactly what she wanted.  Wonderful seller and fast delivery
2675,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,I specifically ordered this item to be a LOCKED FOR VERIZON phone. It was an unlocked AT&T phone. Nobody reads the order instructions anymore. Just anxious to make a sale. BUYER BEWARE!
2676,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,I like the fingerprint reader and battery life.
2677,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,I purchased this phone because I needed an upgrade but unfortunately I was unable to make calls on this phone. Every time I make a call or received one it would automatically hang up. I wouldn't recommend purchasing a phone from this company!
2678,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,The phone had lots of scratches at the back and lots of dents on the edges.
2679,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Battery life is horrible
2680,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,I received the phone and activated the phone and when I tried to make a call it would connect and hang up.....  it wouldn't turn off.... I took it to Verizon and they changed Sim cards and made sure it was up to date. Less than a day later it started doing it again.  They are replacing the phone through there insurance program.... smh
2681,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Phone worked great for all of five minutes. The screen then went black, but I could still hear all the notification sounds. Called the tech support number that came with the phone, they were very nice but just said to send it back. So frustrated and angry I waited this long to get a phone only to have it work for 5 mins and then break. Don't be stupid like me."
2682,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Callers only heard garbled voices. Had to pay shipping both ways. Lost $17 for a phone that could not make phone calls. I spent a couple hours programming phone to find out that it will not make calls
2683,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,this particular phone quit making and receiving calls the 2nd day.  took it to verizon and they could not figure out what was wrong with it.  worked with tech service for over an hour.
2684,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,First phone I purchased had a broken screen. I requested a replacement and the replacement I received has a blacklisted IMEI and cannot be activated.
2685,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Product is defective.  Need replacement asap.
2686,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,The phone came without sim tray since the phone has physical sim card slot. Try to turn on the phone didnâ€™t worked. And on top of that seller send me partial refund. They charge 50$ dollar restocking fees. Make sure Amazon customer if you see this seller donâ€™t buy even if they give you for free. Also very rude behaviour in chat.
2687,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Looks like new. Great price. Looks like a new phone. Works like a new phone.
2688,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,I was nervous about buying a refurbished phone. But I'm so happy I did. The phone arrived in perfect condition and works great and cost me half as much as a new phone.
2689,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Refurbished phone came in immaculate shape, I am very pleased. Hoping it stands the test of time...ğŸ¤"
2690,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Happy I upgraded my phone this Samsung again. I love the Samsung products. Always reliable and getting one for such a great price was amazing.
2691,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,This phone is already junking up on Me. Battery dies fast. And the resolution isn't as vibrant as I thought it would be.  Pretty bummed out
2692,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,I got this at an awesome price.Easy to set up.and transfer files from old phones .Great pics..i look forward to learning more from this phone.
2693,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I did not know what to expect, as I have not bought a used phone before.  I thought it would show some wear.  I was wrong!  It looks brand new, and works great.  I don't use face recognition or finger print, can't say anything about them.  The phone this replaced is an S5, so lots to get used to.  I would buy again!"
2694,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Definitely they way to go if you want a cheap new phone
2695,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"RecibÃ­ el equipo en la fecha indicada, en perfecto estado casi al grado de parecer un equipo nuevo. Viene liberado, cargador y cable genÃ©ricos pero funcionales, veremos el desempeÃ±o con el uso y actualizarÃ© la reseÃ±a cuando pase el tiempo lÃ­mite para hacer la devoluciÃ³n o antes si llegara a fallar"
2696,Samsung,S20 FE,128 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Llego rÃ¡pido y en buenas condiciones, con caja y cargador genÃ©rico. Es una buena opciÃ³n de compra si no deseas gastar mucho por algo bueno y que quieras que te dur.Obviamente en cuestiones de software no viene con lo Ãºltimo"
2697,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"My wife's Galaxy S6 was acting up and about to give up the ghost but she didn't want a big smart phone (like my Galaxy S21 Ultra), but she did want a smart phone. When I presented her with the Galaxy Z Flip 3 she thought it was great. It fits in her small purse very well plus it has most of the bells and whistles that my full-size S21 has. I think she's past the mid-way point in her learning curve (from the S6) and is now a ""spokesperson"" for the new Flip smart phone market. She even got our daughter convinced to buy one, even a renewed one, from Amazon."
2698,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"After seeing the ads on tv for this phone, I decided to give it a try. Seeing the price for last years model (the features are almost identical to this years), I ordered the series 3. The phone works fine with my service provider (Consumer Cellular). It was easy to transfer my information from my old phone with this one. Cosmetically, it is in very good condition. There is a small scratch over one of the camera lenses, but it doesnâ€™t seem to have an effect with the picture. Have only had it for less than a week, but so far so good."
2699,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"This phone was a bit of a risk buy for me, as I know the screens of these phones tend to be a bit less than strong. I was worried with it being refurbished that the screen may have some bad deformity, but I got mine in good condition with the only real downside of buying it refurbished was that my phone didn't come with the built in screen protector. Honestly while I know it is installed for a reason on new ones, I haven't noticed this to be a problem past the 2nd generation of this phone and so far it has been great."
2700,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"No problems whatsoever with the refurbished condition of this phone.  However... the battery life is not great,  I'm guessing  because it has to fold. I'm also getting small cracks at the bend now, after about 4-6 months. Otherwise,  I love this phone! It doesn't slip from a back pocket when I sit. Not once! I'm a phone dropper, so I have a protective case on it. The outside display is improving for listening to music and other features. I recommend this one. The 4 stars are because of the things I mentioned."
2701,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Its a really nice phone with unique capabilities (a folding smartphone; done right, high storage, great specs, etc.). I've been able to play my favorite mobile rpg titles like Nier Reincarnation and Octopath Traveler CotC without issues compared to my previous phone (an S8 Edge). This all comes at the cost of a concerning battery life, guess that's the price you pay for a powerful device (I do not mind this as I don't use my phone too constantly). Overall, great phone if you don't mind the battery all too much."
2702,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,My favorite phone ever. 256GB as advertised. Small dent next to the Bixby button and a very small scratch on the screen just under the camera. Over all very happy with purchase. Was a breeze setting up. Would recommend and buy another. Peace.
2703,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I was pleasantly suprised .This phone did arrive and looks and acts as new I am very pleased battery holds a good charger although not as good as a brand new one but does last most of day .
2704,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I love this phone. I've had so many people ask where I got it and that they love it. Very confused how the screen works but they think nits pretty cool. The charge is a bit of the pain in the ass
2705,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,The battery life has been doing well. But my husband also turns it off at night
2706,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I think this is a great phone for myself but it is not for everyone.It is a unique phone so if you do intend on buying one you should make sure you are fully set on owning one. With that being said if you do want something other than the traditional smart phone this should be a serious consideration.Owned the phone for about a month now and haven't found anything to complain about.
2707,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Phone is in excellent condition as promised.  Front and back screen are like new, no scratches or damage.  The battery is 3300 mAH, similar to my previous phone.  It has been 2 days since I received my Galaxy Flip 3 (256).  So far so good!Update: Almost a month since I received my refurbished Galaxy Flip 3 and no issues."
2708,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,My wife just got the lavender one and itâ€™s in perfect condition. These guys are awesome compared to the last company I want to. I got one coming tomorrow I will give you guys to review.
2709,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I've purchased quite a few high dollar electronics from Amazon refurbished department and have always been satisfied or given a refund. And I feel like I'm helping keeping the waste bin a little bit lighter.
2710,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Me gusta pq lo puedo guardar mÃ¡s fÃ¡cil en mi bolsa, me encanta las fotos,  y la facilidad de moverte de una aplicaciÃ³n a otra.Lo malo es la vida de la baterÃ­a:("
2711,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"This is a lovely phone. It was kept on my Amazon watch list for a long time. The price dropped when the Z Flip 4 was due to be released and I finally was able to purchase a refurbished Z Flip 3 in dark green. It was important that the phone easily fit into my pants pocket which can then be zipped closed. My slab phones always fell out. My Z Flip 3 functions properly. The foldable surface is completely unblemished. The camera takes sharp, beautiful pictures. It takes great night-mode pictures of the stars and celestial events. My complaint: When I unpackaged the phone upon delivery, I discovered the exterior front and rear to be covered with numerous shallow scratches. As a refurbished phone, Amazon advertised it as scratch free from a distance of 12 inches.  This is cosmetic and does not affect the function of the phone, and I had purchased a case to protect and cover the phone. I had 90 days to return it but decided not to."
2712,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I have been wanting this phone for so long in now I got it.It everything  I need it's for I love it so much.
2713,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,User friendly and works great.
2714,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I half-expected the refurbished phone to have some sort of issue with it given how much cheaper it is than it being sold from the actual Samsung store, but no, I lucked out and got a really good condition Z-Flip 3 256GB model for way cheaper than I could have anywhere else.All in all: Was skeptical at first given that it was a reseller, but was proven wrong when I got the Z-Flip in practically perfect condition only knowing it was refurbished made it not perfect, otherwise, perfect."
2715,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"It came in great condition. The camera is better than I expected. A super cute phone, I always have people asking if they can check it out.The only downside, in my opinion, is the battery life really lacks."
2716,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,The phone appeared new.  I know if was a refurb but excellent condition.
2717,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"pros: easy to hold while closed, end calls in style, front camera for pictures while phone is closed, just as good as my note9 was.cons: noises when i close it(not sure if theres dirt or pocket lint maybe), some apps aren't optimized for the screen ratio so they crash unexpectedly(mostly newer/small company apps)"
2718,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,This phone looks like brand new. I would not have known this was a renewed Samsung Galaxy Z Flip. I'm more then pleased with my purchase.  In the future I will definitely purchase a renewed phone from this company again.
2719,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Best gift.
2720,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Perfect just a minor visible scratch in the cover but it's perfect
2721,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I luv it!  Everything works perfectly compact and Convenient.
2722,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Still learning how to use the technological wonder. I love the flip, easily fits into my front pocket when closed.My first experience using a smart phone. NOTE, as it is refurbished this phone does not come with a user manual, which Was stated in the add.The phone was exactly as advertised/stated. Appeared brand new both exterior and internally. Started up like a brand new phone as well.If I didnâ€™t know better I would think this was brand new. It also had the stated 256 of memory.Iâ€™m still learning the feature set which are mind boggling but had to purchase an operating manual before I could use. Available from Amazon, I paid $7 for it and solved all my how to use issues.I am extremely thrilled with this phone and would highly recommend it for anyone needing a compact phone.The screen is unbelievable, even in the â€œfoldâ€ it looks great hard to see where the screen folds once open and NO fuzzy issues where the fold is located.Hope you Enjoy this as much as I am!"
2723,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Iâ€™m an iPhone user and was extremely interested in this phone, for all the obvious reasons. So I bit the bullet and bought one. Seller was great, quick and fast shipping (arrived a day early!). I get the phone and itâ€™s in perfect condition - basically brand new. I got the 256 GB version - some other reviews say they got the lower GB. After fiddling with the phone for a little and taking it on a test run for the day, I found that 1. I do not like the androids OS (little too complicated for me I guess) 2. Having to flip it open over and over can get in the way when your hands are full (I didnâ€™t think this would be a problem, however after using it I realized it was). Other than that itâ€™s a great phone. I love the look of it and how you can customize it with themes on the galaxy store. Iâ€™m definitely an iPhone user. Oh well! :)"
2724,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Well satisfied. Looks great and works as should.
2725,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I was an Apple user, but this phone caught my eye. I got it refurbished, it came in a cardboard box, original charger and not original cable, which I ended up not using. And Amazon Refurbished warranty.It says it's unlocked, however I could not use this phone with AT&T USA or AT&T Mexico, I called them and AT&T USA Customer Service tolde me their network doesn't work with Amazon phones. Had to switch to T-Mobile, which I honestly didn't mind (cheaper and more GB) don't know if it works with other companies, though. It has eSim too, which works for having 2 different Sims at the time.It has no scratches or marks, it looks brand new. It works wonderful and I'm pretty much in love with it.I do have to charge it at night and if I use it a lot, another time throughout the day. I have no issues with this anyway.It's beautiful, easy to carry and compact, fits perfectly in any purse or pocket.It caughts the eye.I recommend this and I'd definitely buy this again. I love it. ğŸ’œ"
2726,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Fits in my pocket so nice.yet large when unfolded.luv it
2727,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"well i was unsure cause some people said it doesnt come with 256gb but it did, the conditon and packing is very good, it comes with charger and cable, believe me i got a very good cosmetic unit. great buy"
2728,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Has performed perfectly .
2729,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I knew what I was getting with a renewed device but the bend is kinda irritating and it came without the screen protector it comes with so now I have to be extra careful til a new screen protector comes. Other then that if you want no defects get it new if you donâ€™t care and want to save money this is good
2730,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"This phone was listed renewed with excellent condition, so I didnâ€™t expect that it has fade color."
2731,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Works amazing and is in perfect condition.
2732,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,The battery will not charge more than 84%. No matter how long you leave it plugged in.
2733,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Update 10.2.2022Warning,  this phone ğŸ“± does not support ASHA blue tooth.  Yet the fold phone ğŸ“± doesIf you have a hearing aid,  you will not be able to use blue tooth to controlA grave oversightOver all,  i like it.  Crease is not really noticeable.Fast,  would have liked android 13, but that's kewlHeavier then expectedEasy to hold.ConsI was not paying attention when I bought it,  does most have a sd slot.  Dance I bought the 256 gig,  it will work outBought a small recharge brick that fits well.Over all,  vid quality is great,Would buy it againI bought a reconditioned model,  condition is greatArrived a day earlier"
2734,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Literally no issues. Perfectly refurbished. Better than expected.
2735,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"This is one of the few times and will be my last time buying a refurb phone from amazon. Now I can say the shipping and packaging was great, but that is about where it ends. The phone was less than a week old and my wife was complaining of the phone always being hot and that the screen would work when it felt like working. Not being able to answer and end phone calls or operate the phone because the screen would just randomly go black and not come back until it felt like doing so. I can honestly say I have only bought a few refurb phones from Amazon, all different sellers, and nothing but issues compared to the ones I have bought from Ebay and get 2-4 years of use from with o issues."
2736,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I like this phone a lot I will never go back to a traditional  brick phone again. The cover screen is awesome too have.  This phone is perfect for people who don't use there phone for social media or whatever else waste of time people  fo on there phones but if you want it to make phone calls,  listen to music and take pictures  this thing is awesome.  You can check your notifications from the cover screen without having to actually unlock and open your phone.  MY ONLY COMPLAINT is buying it refurbished.  Clearly Amazon is blatantly  lying when they say the phone is like new.  It has been clearly used before and there ""refurb"" team is a joke. There is no refurbishment with this phone in any way.  There is deep long scratch on the cover screen.  Lots of debris in the charge port.  And the right side of the crease sounds like it's coming apart. It's like an air bubble under the screen.  The phone doesn't come with a charger  that is even compatible with the phone and is shipped in a box unfolded with nothing to protect the screen. GREAT PHONE! just Amazon is extremely  dishonest with there advertisement saying it's a refurbished phone.. you are just buying someone's used phone. NO REFURBISHMENT WHATSOEVER! I have had much better luck with buying eBay certified refurbished. There they actually have a team to check over the devices, and replace anything less than perfect."
2737,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Product was exactly as advertised. Arrived a day early. I was skeptical like many others buying a ""renewed"" phone. Nothing to worry about at all. So very happy with the phone and the entire experience."
2738,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,
2739,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I never bought a used phone, and so I was very hesitant for many reasons.  I was not sure what the condition of the phone would be, how easily I could set it up per my carrier (Verizon), etc.  I was pleasantly calmed when the phone arrived like new and the set-up was fairly simple.  My fears have been relieved, and I am very content with my purchase."
2740,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,My  mom really likes it I got for early Christmas/ birthday present
2741,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Affordable!!
2742,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"But I rolled the dice and I was happily surprised at the result.I honestly can't tell this phone apart from a brand new one.It came flawless, packaged very nicely. And with 3 month warranty I don't think you can go too far wrong."
2743,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I like the compact size. I love being able to answer and end a call by opening or closing the phone. The battery life is pretty bad, but I can make it through a full day. The wireless charging comes in handy. The positives outweigh the negatives for me. I can't wait for the next version."
2744,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Battery life could be better. Over all I like the phone. No scratches looks new works great.
2745,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I have ordered a few unlocked phones through Amazon, this is my first from the Amazon reseller and unfortunately the first one not as advertised.The phone itself is in great condition though the battery is a little light already. The packaging was also kind of sad and took away from the experience of unboxing a new (to me) phone.The real issue is the carrier. This phone is advertised a unlocked, it's even in the title but, the phone came locked to Verizon network. After speaking with Verizon i was told my only option was to switch over to Verizon. A big game and almost a deal breaker."
2746,SAMSUNG,Z Flip 3 5G,256 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I do like the size of phone to transport, negative feelings about the fold in the screen as it is difficult to play games or move a cursor or touch menu items"
2747,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"I bought this phone so that I could sign up using the built in eSim for an Orange phone plan when I travel to Europe. However, the Google Fi unlimited plan gives me all the data I need for $65/mo and the international calling rate is cheap. Plus I get free text while outside of the US. Best part is, there is no commitment with Google Fi. I only need the plan for a month while I travel but Google Fi is amazing for travelers.When I signed up w Google Fi, I requested that they mail me a physical ""data only"" sim card, which I inserted into my Samsung phone. Now, I can also use my Samsung to view online maps while in Europe...and the sim shares the same plan data usage so there is no additional cost!If you have a phone with an eSim already built in your phone, you can sign up for Google Fi without a physical sim card. You just download the app and follow the steps. Then, after you're set up with a plan, you can use the Google Fi sim card that they mailed you and insert it into any other phone or tablet, and have free shared data on that device.The phone itself is super easy to navigate. Everything is linked to my Google acct so set up was super easy. I still use my Samsung phone thru T-Mobile but Google Fi offers a better plan for international travelers.Only one CON: No headphone jack. You have to buy an external adapter that plugs into the charging port of the phone or get wireless headphones."
2748,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,So far I have enjoy the Google pixel.  Easy to catch on the power button is confusing.  The only thing I don't like is occasionally my phone will get really hot and I don't use it very often.
2749,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"I don't use the fingerprint reader or the face recognition, so, I cannot evaluate them. The battery has been ok. Mostly, I'm writing this because I just upgraded (after being prodded by Google) from Android 12 to 13, and that process rendered my Pixel 6 phone 100% useless/inoperable, and it's impossible to find anyone at Google to try and fix the phone or even tell me where to send it. The companies they use to repair their cellphones don't deal with catastrophic issues like this, which begs the question, ""what's then the point of even having a warranty?"" I purchased the phone in January, it arrived in February, and I absolutely loved it (bought one with 256 storage capacity, and it worked perfectly till I just tried to install Android 13, which, like Pixel, is made by Google). What are the odds of this happening!? Maybe someone reading this at the Amazon Pixel Store will be able to help me/others with this problem? I've tried every phone number and online Google site associated with Pixel phones, and I'm just thoroughly disgusted and completely lost as to my (lack of) options. I've been a committed Google-product user since they first started out as nothing but a search engine. And now this. So very sad...."
2750,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"I originally bought this because I thought I wanted to upgrade from my LGV30. However, there's some things that this phone couldn't do that my much older phone could (person preferences).I'll keep it simple.CON'S:Â· You must have a Google account in order to use this phone (I already knew this before I purchased it).Â· You MUST use Google photos in order to use ""blur"" and ""magic eraser"". These are not camera features. These are app features. ""Un-blur"" photos is only available on 6 Pro or with a Google One account.Â· Nightsight isn't that good. It's a slow process. And sometimes it doesn't take good photos.Â· Its a large, heavy phone. You need a dedicated pocket for it. If you have small hands, your hand will cramp up after awhile.Â· 5g. Although the connection was good, 5g drains your battery life quicker than 4g. However, you'll still have about 1 full day of life with moderate-to-heavy usage.Â· U.I. resembles an iPhone. You can't edit the App drawer (no folders. Can't hide preinstalled apps). Widgets are a pain (can't resize them properly). It's an ugly interface.Â· Fingerprint reader: use your thumb.Â· The phone itself is VERY slippery. You need a case with good grip. Which makes large phone even larger.PRO'S:  Sleek & smooth. Tons of security options, however, it's still Google (censorship king).Other than that, my old, outdated, LGV30 performs better on a day to day basis. Uses less battery (and it's smaller). Has a higher IP rating. It's MUCH lighter & more durable. And other than ""Nightsight"", the camera is on par, despite the lower pixels."
2751,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"I've only had this phone for a week, but so far I really like it. I had an older Pixel before this one, so it takes a while to get used to because they've changed things a little bit. It is a little touchy at times and I need to push an app a little hard to get it to open. Over all though, I don't regret my purchase."
2752,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,This pos don't know if it's a android or a iphone. Claims to be android but you have to swipe to go anywhere. Biggest down I have is the poor quality screen. PLASTIC screen. It is hard to input keys from typing and is so noisy with my fingers clubbing the screen to make it work I wake up the whole house. My dog even barked thinking some one was at the door knocking.  Could have been a descent phone. But again greed got in the way. Used cheap ass materials to manufactur. So junk it is. I can't wait to break it. And get a phone worth owning. Not recommended at this time. Junk in my book. Maybe a seven is better. Idk  The six is not good. Regret it already. I always have gotten Galaxy s series phones. The 21 turbed me off. After getting ripped off by att. I pledged to never buy Samsung again. I may have to rethink that. Google pixel is junk
2753,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,The only complaint I have is the fingerprint reader built into the screen is slow and often does read my finger unless it is positioned exactly right.  I had no luck getting my thumb to register.
2754,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"A good phone for the money, just don't expect Samsung quality.The camera is excellent, which was the only reason why I bought this phone, and the only reason why I'm not returning it. It's really good.Unfortunately, the rest of the phone is so so. Google's launcher is clumsy and not very user-friendly. You can replace it with the Microsoft Launcher, which helps a lot. Unfortunately, you are still stuck with Google's horrible notification bar, which is a constant annoyance to use, and can't be customized. Google's on-screen keyboard is also not great, but this can be replaced with Microsoft's keyboard, which can be customized into a great board.The phones come with just as much pre-installed junk, as the phones you buy from the operators. I expected there to be less, since it's unlocked, and doesn't have a 3rd company to fill it with their bloat, but Google apparently saw this as an opportunity to put extra junk of their own. Brilliant.The battery is the worst part of the phone. It drains fast, and charges slow. Kind of the opposite of what you want.All in all. If I had known about the shortcomings of Google Pixel 6, I would have kept my Samsung Galaxy S10, even though the camera isn't that great. I got a better camera sure, which is important in my opinion, but everything else is worse."
2755,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"When I first got the phone, it would heat up and the battery would drain really quickly, but that doesn't happen anymore. I also put my phone in battery saver mode, which I have set to turn off most of my apps, and that extends my battery life even more.My phone also charges quite quickly during the day, or slowly overnight, on my wireless charger - I can leave it charging while I am sleeping and it will be ready in the morning when I wake up.My only gripe is that when I want to see all the apps on standby so I can clear them, I have to swipe a very particular way, otherwise when I swipe up I get all my list of apps instead."
2756,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,Great phone . easy transition from old phone. Great  camera. Voice recognition and processor great . Overall a good value The price had dropped $100 When I checked the day after I received it. Live agent would not allow price adjustment. Not the best experience for that.
2757,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"If you want a more private experience with the pixel 6 (good phone) without the prying eyes of Google, use calyxos"
2758,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"I had a Pixel 2 XL before this with a fingerprint reader on the rear. It works well, is very quick, and pretty much still works first time. I loved it. The Pixel 6 is slow and unreliable. I think it may be affected adversely by dry hands, but I'm not sure yet. It is a constant hassle, and really detracts from the experience of using the phone, which is pretty nice otherwise.The sound from the speakers is much better than my Pixel 2. Much fuller sound. I listen to audiobooks and podcasts a lot, and don't like wearing earbuds all the time, so the speaker is useful for that, and for the speakerphone. Also, it's nice for listening to music when I just want something similar to a radio. This sounds better than most radios I've had.It's pretty fast with 5G, and even pretty fast with LTE. I have T-Mobile with a fairly strong signal, although a bit over-crowded due to a nearby community college, high school, middle school, and large mall. My fastest speed was 320 mb/s down, and 62 up. Wifi speed on my 250 mb/s internet is pretty close to max when a few rooms away from the router. I think if I test in the same room, I'd get about max speed."
2759,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"What I like (in comparison to pixel 2):* Better battery life* More local storageWhat's similar:* Picture quality (as far as I can tell). There is likely improvement of some sort, but I was just as happy with the quality I've had on my pixel 2.What's worse:* Bigger size. This is definitely a subjective one. I end up using two hands to operate this phone. I like that I could do everything with one hand on my pixel 2... I could reach to the other corner with a thumb and still hold the phone with the same one hand.* The camera bulking out. That bulking out part makes it harder to pull out of the pocket, and downright impossible when you're sitting down, like in a car. Also, it acts like a scrape, scraping everything out of your pocket when pulling it out. My wallet has fallen out number of times already, each time horrifying me that next time I'll lose it. This is something hard to unticipate when designing a product, but this bulge is straight evil.What's unacceptably poor:* Finger scan on the screen - I hate it!! I'd absolutely rather have have similar to the pixel 2 on the back that *works consistently*, over this one on the screen that works 70% of the time, and even when it does, it takes me a full 3-10 seconds *massaging the area* to unlock my phone. Given you perform this unlocking functionality 30-50 times per day - it is the most annoying downgrading feature.Why didn't I go back to my pixel 2, you ask? Because the software support has already stopped over a year back and some of the apps are glitching / not working any more, so I was forced to ""upgrade"" to an inferior device."
2760,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"I have a love hate relationship with this phone. With a generic screen protector on it, the fingerprint reader is about 50/50 at best. I would have preferred it stay on the back or even the side, but this design is terrible.A also think its the dimmest screen of any phone I've had in years. I have to turn it up to full blast during the day - which isn't great for the battery.But the vanilla android 12 and now android 13 is a great OS, and the camera and the camera software is unparalleled.Would I but this again, 'm not sure I would. But I'm not ready to trade it now that I have my grubby paws on it."
2761,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,The phone is definitely awesome. Battery life could need a little improvement and the way the phone responds to the fingerprint can also be improved. Everything else speed the smoothness of the transitioning between screens and the security from the phone top notch.
2762,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,I've primarily used Samsung Galaxy phones in the past. I'm coming from a Samsung Galaxy S10e and this feels like an upgrade. Battery life is great though if you're used to fast charging this is pretty slow. Finger print reader is hit or miss. I am really missing the SD card slot but what ya gonna do... It has lots of little features that I'm still learning to use which for the most part I have found to be useful. I also love that this phone had absolutely no bloatware on it. The camera is the best I've used on a smart phone. Overall I'm liking the phone. It is a nice competitor for the Samsung phones
2763,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"How can you still have problems after all these years, especially with the finger print issue; 40% of the time doesn't work; read my finger print, if it does takes 3-5 seconds to active / open the phone or any transactions, come on man; other carrier already doing face unlock, and you guys can't even get your finger print and app crash issue right?! Get it right!!!!  ( I bought these android google Pixel 6 phone because I am sick of the Apple BS, how they force you to buy more data or else you can't do anything on your phone, read email, take more pic etc etc. but let me tell you, after using these pixel 6 I think I might need to return it and go with other phone maker; Samsung, HTC etc etc, ( I promise myself will NEVER buy apple product again; because they are so greedy every time I see an apple it makes me sick!!! I can't even eat an apple no more because of apple!!! But; please google; if you guys see this?! Fix your finger print app crash issu!!! Otherwise you are going to be blackberry or Nokia!!!"
2764,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"It's neat to have a phone with a little bit different features. I only bought it for the camera, and I was not disappointed.Unfortunately the touch screen is not sensitive enough by a wide margin.With touch sensitivity at max and screen protector sensitivity on ( but no screen protector) it is still frustrating having to double, triple tap the screen to get anything to happen.Everything else is good.TCL 10 pro had a better screen but i wasn't impressed by the camera"
2765,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"I really like this phone and it's an upgrade from my old unlocked Galaxy. I really bought this because it's unlocked and I was very curious as to how it worked. I am not disappointed at all. I have Tracfone monthly service which works very well, although I had to call Tracfone to get it to work. The only real problem I first had was the slipperiness of the phone itself. I got a case for it just to be able to hold onto it. I have not bothered to use the fingerprint feature because I never could trust it in any phone."
2766,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"So far, the camera is amazing. Sharp, clear pictures with excellent color. This phone gets very hot when charging, and takes two hours to fully charge It is light weight, slim and easy to slip into a pocket or bag. I was frustrated that I purchased it during Prime Days but was not charged the prime price. It also took 10 days to arrive. However, three days in, it seems like a decent phone. Update: I am sending this phone back for several reasons:The camera randomly shuts off  while trying to take photosThe video camera randomly does not work so I missed videoing my granddaughters  dance recital. Neither the camera or video feature worked until I restarted the phone so I have no photos or video of a special, family event.Massively overheats when charging, almost too hot to holdYou have to push two buttons to turn it off, take a screen shot, or restart. For an older person, such as myself, this requires two hands and several attempts for it to actually work.Calls are dropped more often than they go through.Now, I have reordered the same phone in the hopes that I simply received a poor quality item. When the camera works, it is spectacular and as a grandparent, this is worth it to me to give it another shot.If this phone continues with the same issues, I will try a different phone such as Samsung. Will continue updates as they are applicable."
2767,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,Altavoz izquierdo no le funciona
2768,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"Es mi primer telefono ""Gama alta"" y la verdad estoy encantado con su rendimiento en general, no tengo ninguna queja o punto negativo a resaltar en estas ultimas dos semanas de uso"
2769,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"I bought the phone case, never dropped the phone, and have a screen protector on the screen.  It cracks one inch from the bottom right corner.  I had a Samsung 8S+ for over 5 years, no cracks just scratches.  This phone I owned since the end of September, it is now end of November and it is cracked.  Takes great pics."
2770,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"This is my first Google Pixel phone and I'm glad I made the switch. I've previously used Motorola phones and decided to spend a little more on my next phone. I'm glad I did as the photo quality is better than the Motorola Edge my wife bought.There was a learning curve with the new phone, but not too bad. I do wish it had the chop gesture to turn on the flashlight like the Motorola's.It charges quickly and has a really long battery life.Pictures are fantastic. Motion pictures come out clearer than on the Motorola's. I like the eraser feature and portrait modes really make the picture pop."
2771,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"Overall the phone is good and is what you expect to get. The only issue in my case was wifi. After setting up the phone there was a constant wifi issue and soon expanded to a cellular issue as well. This occurred after few minutes of the phone being turned on. After watch videos online and reading articles... if you face similar issues here is the solution. I recommend turning on the phone, connecting to wifi, logging in to play-store and quickly download ""Carrier Services"". After this the cellular issues went away, and most of the wifi issues. I have 2 routers at my home and there is a reliability issue connection to one of them. Hopefully this helps. Overall its a good phone with a decent camera.I expected the camera quality to be better just like in the youtube comparison videos."
2772,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"I really needed a new phone because my 64gb Pixel 3 XL was out of storage space.  So I decided to get the latest Google had to offer.  It just happened to be on sale for $200 off which is what caused me to pull the trigger.My first impressions of the phone was that it was smaller that I expected because it is more narrow.  My Pixel 3 XL and Nexus 6P feel much larger compared to this.  I'm not a fan of Android 12 as I liked the how much easier 11 was to navigate.  Phone runs smoothly except when trying to bring up the OSD.  Every once in a while it will just freeze the app you are running and require a restart.  Security updates take nearly an hour to apply (even a small 20mb update took forever).The biggest problem I have with this phone is that it does not support tethering (Hotspot, USB, Bluetooth).  This has been a known issue since Android 12 has been out and Google refuses to fix it.  Before I was able to tether with my Pixel 3 just fine but as soon as I put my sim card in the 6, it immediately fails to connect.  The phone itself is very slippery so it is easy to drop or slide off a non flat surface.  I highly recommend a case.Overall, I would honestly return this phone but I needed a new phone, so instead I will use it as a trade in for a better phone."
2773,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"I was looking forward to the Pixel 6. I had converted to the Pixel 5 and loved it and everything I saw about the 6 excited me, but it failed to deliver. I will list Pros and Cons so you can decide for yourself.Pros1. It does have a decent battery. However I would say the 24 hour claim is not accurate.2. The camera is amazing. In any mode I was impressed.3. This is more Google than the Pixel but integration into the Google family was super simple, and the phone was not preloaded with a lot of massware to delete.Cons1. The colors were horrible on receipt. You have to do a lot of work to get the colors decent.2. The At a Glance App that is forced on the home screen is useless. You can't see it, you can't move it, and you can't turn it off. All it has done is cut down on your home screen size. Google already takes some of your home screen with the mandatory search bar so this is more space lost.3. The keyboard is horrible. I don't like having to download 3rd party keyboards, but for this phone I had too. It seemed to not pick up what I was typing. I went through calibration and sensitivity but nothing helped.4. The apps require such sensitivity that it makes changing apps harder.I hope Google fixes these issues. How they could step backwards so much shocks me. Mine is going back."
2774,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"I have been a die hard Samsung customer for many years. It was time for a change. While it is still android, it has taken a little to get use to but I am learning to love it. The main thing that I would change is with the sound settings. I personally like being able to adjust the ring and notification sounds separately. With this phone, they are the same when it comes to the sound level. Other than that I have not had any other issues with the phone."
2775,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,Bluetooth cannot connect or connected but no sound from receiving speakers. Sound from map navigator also hiccups. Had to buy a Moto G Stylus 5G phone for less than half of the price in a hurry but luckily found out the Moto phone worked better in many ways.
2776,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"Shipping took a while, but arrived in good condition. Works great"
2777,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,Wireless does not work at all.  Battery drains very fast and it is overheating.
2778,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"Upgraded from Pixel 2XL, this phone is relatively same in size, although much heavier. Display itself is good, but not great. The panel itself has some sort of off axis pink color shift, very noticeable when reading text on white background. Camera, battery life and performance are great. Fingerprint reader is disappointingly bad, does not work in 2/3 cases, even after January update (which promised to improve fingerprint reader accuracy)."
2779,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"I love it. Was so excited for the Pixel 6. When it finally arrived I couldn't wait to set it up, and it came in prestine condition. It's been working fine and have had no issues at all. Always wanted a Pixel device, so I'm happy to finally own one"

2783,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"Great design, great camera.Phone will become hot with normal usage, battery drains fast"
2784,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"Well, apart from a sluggish fingerprint sensor everything else is stellar. Google ecosystem is great, from maps to assistant. I got an original case with it, fits perfectly. Highly recommend for people who want to be different from the otherwise bland crowd of apple fans. Great phone!"
2785,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,The talk to text on this phone is amazing but it is not worth it the fingerprint reader is garbage you canâ€™t use a screen protector I tried four of them before I just gave up and returned a damn phone
2786,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,The battery life is amazing and the photo quality is superb.  Fingerprint reader is kind of lame but I do love this phone!
2787,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"I ordered this thinking it was new. I never saw anything that listed it as restored. I received the package and saw that it had been opened. I looked at the description and searched ""restored"" and ""refurbished,"" but didn't find anything. Lame.Probably a good phone, but I wanted one with a new battery. I'll probably need to return it."

2796,Google,Pixel 6,256 GB,Android 12.0,6.4 Inches,"I have always been a fan of the Google Pixel experience and was very excited for the Pixel 6.  However, I could not get past how big, clunky, and heavy the phone is!  After about 5 minutes of holding/handling the phone I knew there is no way I was keeping it.  Why they didn't make it the perfect size of the pixel 5 is beyond me!  There is certainly no need for the only options to be big phones.  Disappointed to say the least!  Hopefully Google gives it's fans different size options next year!"
2797,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Lo tengo en mis manos desde el 11-10-2022; y hoy 11-11-2022 hago mi reseÃ±a para compartir mi experiencia.Aunque es la primera vez que compro un telÃ©fono con 8GB de RAM, puedo decir que estoy muy complacido con mi compra, ya que mi anterior telÃ©fono tenÃ­a 3GB.En cuanto al espacio de 128GB, me siento bastante bien y conforme, ya que antes tenÃ­a que estar eliminando Apps, Fotos y Videos para tener mÃ¡s espacio disponible.Algo que deseaba tener de un telÃ©fono es el puerto Tipo C, ya que es mucho mÃ¡s cÃ³modo y eficiente; y por suerte, ya lo van a estandarizar, por lo que todos los telÃ©fonos del mundo que salgan a partir de ahÃ­ lo tendrÃ¡n.El tamaÃ±o de la pantalla es excelente, ya que, hace mucho que querÃ­a tener un telÃ©fono con una pantalla de mÃ¡s de 6 pulgadas, ya que asÃ­ todo se ve mucho mejor y ayuda a no forzar tanto la vista.Me encanta la idea de que mantenga las actualizaciones al dÃ­a, asÃ­ podrÃ© sentirme un poco mÃ¡s seguro, ademÃ¡s de la optimizaciÃ³n del equipo, que siempre viene incluida.La cÃ¡mara de 48 MegapÃ­xeles y el excelente Zoom me tienen complacido; solo que a veces pone las fotos como con ambientes que hacen que no tengan la suficiente nitidez y calidad, pero he notado que lo hace cuando el clima exterior no estÃ¡ normal y soleado. La cÃ¡mara frontal tambiÃ©n estÃ¡ muy bien.Ahora puedo jugar mis juegos favoritos con total libertad y movilidad; aunque, hay algunos que siempre exigen mÃ¡s, por lo que, en Ã©se caso, solo me adapto.Se siente bastante bien al agarrarlo, ya que es liviano, suave y fino; y aunque el protector es fino y delicado, le puse un PopSocket para poder agarrarlo con mayor comodidad, ya que se me hace difÃ­cil usar un telÃ©fono sin Ã©se accesorio.Me gusta la idea de que tenga el cristal Gorilla Glass 4; que aunque tengo otros protectores para el telÃ©fono y la pantalla en mi carro de Amazon, me siento un poco confiado de que si se me cae, no se me daÃ±arÃ¡ la pantalla muy fÃ¡cil; ademÃ¡s, me siento tranquilo al poder poner llaves en el bolsillo junto a Ã©l, ya que antes tenÃ­a que tener cuidado y usar un bolsillo exclusivo para el telÃ©fono, para evitar rayones en la pantalla.TambiÃ©n me he adaptado a la nueva forma de usar el telÃ©fono sin botones en la parte de abajo; ya que al tener la opciÃ³n de ""ir atrÃ¡s"" con solo deslizar hacia la izquierda o la derecha en los bordes, es mucho mÃ¡s cÃ³modo, fÃ¡cil y eficiente.Otra opciÃ³n que me encanta muchÃ­simo es la de la ""llave inteligente"", que es el botÃ³n del lado izquierdo, ya que ahÃ­ configurÃ© las capturas de pantalla con un solo toque, ya que hago capturas a cada rato sobre los juegos que voy jugando, entre otras cosas; y la linterna la puse con 2 clics porque al ponerla con 1 se puede activar al meterse el telÃ©fono en el bolsillo o al ser tocado sin interÃ©s de encenderla.Tiene muy buen sonido y se siente bien al escuchar lo que voy viendo y sin problemas de calidad.El sensor de huellas digitales estÃ¡ alucinante, ya que tiene una sensibilidad muy buena.Sin embargo, no uso protecciÃ³n con huella digital por Seguridad, ya que, un PolicÃ­a mal intencionado o un delincuente, pueden obligarte por la fuerza a poner tu dedo o dedos para abrir tu telÃ©fono y robarte dinero o informaciÃ³n que no tienes interÃ©s en compartir; por eso solo uso un patrÃ³n, ya que, aunque alguien intente ver de lejos, es mÃ¡s difÃ­cil seguir la ruta de tus dedos; pero no serÃ­a igual si pones un PIN.Hasta ahora lo Ãºnico que no me ha funcionado de las opciones internas es la del NFC, ya que solo aparece la opciÃ³n de configuraciÃ³n avanzada (en inglÃ©s), pero al tocarla no lleva a ningÃºn sitio; y cuando abro alguna App que permite pagos sin contacto, al buscar la tecnologÃ­a en el telÃ©fono y no encontrarla, se sale.En fin, estoy satisfecho con el telÃ©fono; y con relaciÃ³n al tema de los pagos NFC, deberÃ­an resolver eso con tiempo, ya que hoy en dÃ­a eso es muy necesario e importante y deberÃ­a de estar funcionando con normalidad; aunque, espero que corrijan el error en alguna actualizaciÃ³n.Sin dudas mi compra de otro telÃ©fono mÃ¡s adelante serÃ¡ de la Marca Umidigi, ya que ofrecen dispositivos de alta calidad con garantÃ­a, a muy bajo costo.Gracias por tu tiempo.Gracia y Paz."
2798,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The Umidigi F3 is the perfect mid-range mobile phone for the user who wants a balance of performance and price. This phone has a premium features, more-than-acceptable camera, excellent battery life, and speedy processor.Premium Features: The F3 includes features that you would find in pricier phones.  You can unlock the phone via the front camera or the side button fingerprint reader.  I happen to prefer using the side button over the screen reader on most other phones because of convenience.  The F3 also includes an FM radio receiver built in.  How cool is that!?!  Another capability that you no longer find in most phones is a headset jack.  You have the option to use both wired and wireless headsets.  Although the screen is only 1650 x 720, everything is bright and clear.  Playing non-graphics intensive games has been great with no motion issues.Camera: The F3 triple rear cameras and single front camera are more than acceptable for the regular user.  Selfies turn out sharp and clear and photos with the rear photos have clarity that match more expensive phones like the Samsung S21 (I couldn't believe it either...and my significant other is quite ticked off on how much she spent on her S21...LOL).Battery: The F3 has a 5150 mAh battery, which surpasses almost every other phone out there.  I can easily wait 2 days before having to recharge the phone.  Only negative is that there is no wireless charging.Processor:  This is the biggest surprise for me with the F3.  The MediaTek Helio P70 was fast with no noticeable lagging when navigating apps, playing games, and editing documents.  Granted, the chip cannot handle graphics hogging games, but then, most phones can't either.In general, I would recommend the Umidigi F3 to anyone who wants a phone that provides higher value than the price would indicate.  This would also make a great second phone or one for your younger kids."
2799,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The specs seem good on paper, but it struggles when connected to my car with Google Auto. It's pretty good otherwise, most applications run with no perf issues.The location of the fingerprint reader (part of the on/off button) is uncomfortable - most times I hold it, one of my fingers is there, and the reader tries to decipher it even though I didn't want that.All in all, a mediocre phone that's somewhat disappointing compared to the older S3Pro. The only reason I replaced the S3 Pro is that Umidigi doesn't provide any updates for it, so it's stuck with Android 9."
2800,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Still learning about what all this phone can do but all in all I'm very happy with this purchase. Especially after agonizing for 2 weeks as to what phone to get. I'm glad I chose this
2801,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,First off had a heck of a time getting it to hook up to my wifi.  Kept telling me was connected but no internet. I still tried to open Chrome told me my date and time were wrong so couldn't do a hand off. Here the date was Nov 2004 and was set to somewhere in Mexico. Once corrected that seemed to fix it that!  my old Umidigi was 3 yrs old and the battery was dying. So far so good with getting on US Mobile was a breeze. Will try to update.
2802,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,It's okay.
2803,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The umidigi F3, another umidigi phone entering my household. This has been number 5? So I may be biased, but there's a reason I've identified so well with this brand. They produce quality inexpensive phones. The hardware you get for the price you spend is easily twice as much as other competitors.I know and trust umidigi, they update their software, they support their customers, and they make awesome tech. Trusting a company, especially one that most people haven't heard of, is such an awesome thing.I get a phone with a wonderful camera, good battery life, that's stylish, comes with a case and screen protector, all for less than what most garbage phones in the states ask for.Ask yourself do you actually want to keep buying phones that are overpriced or don't work? No of course not. Umidigis f3 phone works in there U.S they make actually global, global phones.All this on basically stock android too, no horrible software bloat like the major companies I've bought from add into their phones.Give umidigi a try, My house uses them, my uncle uses them, and my friends use them."
2804,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Mil veces mejor que un Samsun o Hawei
2805,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"This is a performance phone for $200. UMIDIGI is a go to phone if you want a cheap phone with high end specs. Well worth the price.. why?Pros:8GB Ram and 128 GB internal storage. Plenty for smooth operation and storageGreat Pictures from Sony Cameras.. my attached pics were taken with the phone. Crisp clear pictures!The short cut button is customizable and really helpful for frequent tasks and quick launch of appsThe humongous battery and fast charging together, they give you a peace of mind for days. Turn off the ""screen on when you pickup"" function from settings if you want to extend batter lifeGlobal 4G network compatibility without loss of speed and reliabilityAudio is loud and clearNo bloatware.. this is very important for meCons:Android 11 - will it ever get to 12?Not a 5G phoneThe finger print scanner is the power button.. it's really sensitive and I accidentally turned the phone off multiple times, while trying to setup fingerprint. I would've also preferred an in screen finger print scannerI'll continue to update this as I use the phone.. overall, I recommend this phone if you are looking for a cheap high performance phone."
2806,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"This phone is a perfect mid-ranger. I believe it's perfect for kids to adults that just want a reliable device that runs without lag. I have been using Umidigi devices for years now. They all still work without issues for all this time. I still use an Umidigi S3 Pro as my Pokefone. This is still a brand that provides a case, a screen protector, and a charger ! The battery lasts all day, the screen is nice and big, and the back looks great. It has a shortcut button that let's you choose whatever app you want to open with a single click. And then you can choose a different app for a double click. I usually pick the flashlight for that. And then a press and hold for a 3rd app. I love that if you choose to navigate with gestures, there is not hint bar like on Pixel devices, yo get a nice full screen. This phone has zero bloat. This phone has 8gb of ram so you won't have any slowdowns. And if you are Android tinkerer like myself, it is very easy to root this device. At this price point this is a no brainer."

Â For 200 bucks ( + taxes if applicable). Umidigi F3 is a great phone for everyday use, with 8 GB memory and 128 Gigs of internal storage, there's no worry of running out of storage because of pics or apps.The battery capacity for Umidigi phones have been at the 5050mAh which gives more than a day of good usage easily too, I have another Umidigi Phone (s3 Pro) for 2+ yrs now which still gives a day plus of usage.Having used this phone for a couple of days now, and haven't experienced any lags or missed touch response.The UX has been kept close to stock and not a ton of default Apps come installed which is great!Easily able to connect to 4G LTE networks ( TMobile and AT&T). Camera quality is good for this price range. The customizable button comes in handy for frequent operations.It also comes with a charger/USB3 charging cable, a screen protector applied and a protector case!!The only thing that I think could have been better was if it came with Android 12, it runs Android 11, I hope that it gets Android 12 upgrade soon.Overall a great value!"
2808,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"If you are looking for ""bang for the buck,"" this is it.  First off, I have to say that I am a bit prejudiced. I've owned a Umidigi F1 Play for several years and it has been faultless.  When I saw this F3 at $161.49 I thought I would try it.  After receiving it I found its large screen, 6.7"", to be bright and exactly the size I wanted.  After starting it up the processor was blazing fast.  Another big plus is the reception.  I have found dead spots with my other phones in my area.  This one pulled in a signal where others could not.  I was disappointed in one area, transferring apps and data from my old phone.  I tried Bluetooth and NFC and I could not connect to my old Umidigi F1 Play.  It may have been me or there was a compatibility issue between the two phones.  What you get with this phone is a good camera, great performance, outstanding connectivity, and an unbeatable price."
2809,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The silver color looks so pretty. Features of camera are powerful and really useful, I like the extrawide angle mode. The screen is big and bright and crisp. Big battery, 8g of memory, 128g of storage, mainstream configuration, smooth operation, clear and bright sound, and importantly no annoying app built in ---- I don't like being forced to cram in a lot of junk. Also commendable is the gift of a beautiful transparent phone case.However, the adapter is always so big due to fast charging.  My power strip is overcrowded  :("
2810,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Iâ€™ve owned several union phones. The phones do not feel cheap or miss essential features. The new f3 actually is a great phone. Is better than the Samsung a series. The photos are quite good, the phone is zippy, the screen is bright and crisp. I am actually impressed. It paired with my watch and no problems with Wi-Fi or lagging in videos. Those phone is actually worth more then theyâ€™re charging. Iâ€™ve given cheaper phones to the kids and they actually prefer this phone and want me to buy one for their birthday."

2813,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I like the phone a lottttt, but the matte silver looks a lot darker than the one advertised in the pictures. I'll be returning it for a black one. My Qlink wireless sim card works good in this phone. Great size and price"
2814,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I must admit it is a very nice looking device.  However I'm not sure if it's a 4g or LTE phone. I tried to get it activated on 3 different service providers and neither could get the phone activated. But looked good,  camera seemed nice,  screen was clear but while using super fast xfinity internet it seemed a little slower than I expected."
2815,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Wow wow wow!!! This is a beautiful phone for a fraction of what phones usually cost. Brand new and packaged beautifully. It works like a charm and I am very proud to call this my phone. The more expensive brands are so overrated and they charge too much. This phone is worth it folks!
2816,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,The phone has a great finish and the battery life is insaneits easy to set up just put my sim in and its up and runningthe headphone jack is a plus
2817,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Phone was locked for Boost, but they have made every reasonable attempt to take care of it."
2818,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Battery life is Great! And the picture quality is Awesome, been watching more of my shows on the go. Umidigi has come up Big!"
2819,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Make sure you read everything
2820,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Unboxed, set up wifi, transfer all stuff from my old phone, man I love this phone, up until I put my Sim in. The Mrs got a text from cell carrier that my number was deleted from the account, phone locked up no internet no text, no calls nothing. Att/cricket text said to immediately put my Sim in my old phone or reactivation fees will be incurred. Switch back Sim to old phone call them up they say its a 3g phone, I said no I made sure it was 4g, check imei numbers it's 3g.best of luck this is my 6th umidigi but the last 2 have been no goes because of being 3g but labeled 4g"
2821,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,The battery lasts all-day! Even with me using the phone the entire day it had 17% charge when I went to bad. I bluetooth music to my bedroom stereo and play it all night. Music was still playing when I woke. The phone works lightning âš¡ fast. The facial recognition is nice. Fingerprint is iffy. I have problems with fingerprint readers on every phone I have owned. The F1 seems to be getting better with the fingerprint reader as I use it more. Great phone for an excellent price.
2822,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"It says unlocked to all carriers but,it's wrong and false advertisement because,I took it to cricket and tried to get this phone on with a new sim card .and they said it's not compatible with cricket service so I'm having to send this phone back before I can even get my 200 back so I'm not very happy,and the seller needs put on here who it is and who it is not compatible with because,it's bull crap when you got unlock to all carriers when's it's not so if you have cricket do not buy this phone bc it won't work...."
2823,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"El equipo en general llegÃ³ en buenas condiciones, la pantalla tiene un pixel muerto pero en general el celular funciona bien"
2824,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Really great for the price, I've heard some iffy reviews of camera, but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. The tones are a tad warm, and you have to take the time to focus correctly in bokeh(portrait) mode, but all in all very satisfied. Quick and powerful. I'd buy it again."
2825,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Muy buen celular justo en cuanto a exigencias de organizaciÃ³n y procesacion de programas muy rÃ¡pido con muy buena baterÃ­a y a un excelente precio no le pide nada a los de gama alta
2826,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I love love love this UMIDIGI Smartphone. This is the perfect size. Response is very fast. The look is streamlined. The color, which is a dreamy color RED is not too bright , just right.  Kind of satin looking. The weight is perfect. I am so happy!!! Just get this exceptionally beautiful high end phone."
2827,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Good phone.. Value for money. Bought it for discount.
2828,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,This is not good at all.
2829,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Hasta aora todo funciona perfectamente
2830,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,The camera on this phone is crap. For 48 and 16 megapixal camera. It's cheaply made. And then to compare it with Samsung camera that's just lie and deceptive. Now the speaker not working. It's I rip off. Not worth the cost.  I wanted a phone because my phone stopped working but this is garbage
2831,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Update July 2020.After having the phone for a few weeks, a few dead pixels show up, in the middle of the screen, only noticeable in black backgrounds. They sent a new one with no problem, and I am in the process to returning the old one. The new one is working great so far, we had to go back to metropcs to activate the sim card in the new one, this time they charge us 25 dlls, we like this phone a lot, the battery is durable, the camera is great. I am planning to order another one for my self, this one is for my boyfriend, he works at construction so that is why the screen protector is already damage in the old phone, for normal use it will be fine for a while. I didn't find any good hard case protector in amazon, but I tried at the store the case for Moto G Stylus and it did fit the phone, the only problem are the buttons in the case, they don't match, but I don't mind, I am planning to make a hole or something, because I really need a good sturdy case before my boyfriend crack the phone.June-2020Arrive on time, despite the seller didn't gave any tracking information. The phone works great and the battery life is good, has 1 slot for 1 SIM only, and the 2nd slot is for a SIM or a SD card. Is working fine with metro-pcs, despite we had to go to different customer service places, because in the 1st one they just say that phone won't work with metropcs, they only switch the SIM from the old phone to the new one, of course that didn't work! american cell phones companies married the SIM with the imei, so the company has to do the process first. in the second place, the lady was really helpful and start the process immediately, took like 5 minutes and cost under 17 dlls. I also tried a mexican SIM from movistar and works really good, I didn't even had to add the configuration for APN, to have 4G, automatically did it, not like other unlock phones I had before. The camera is decent, and the apps run smoothly, comes with one screen protector installed and a simple black case, flexible."
2832,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Pones are nice however they donâ€™t work with tracfone.
2833,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Had the Play F1 for 17 months and very happy with the phone for the price. Easily the best battery life of any phone I have owned. Can get over 10 hours screen on time staying between 10 and 90 percent as do not charge to 100 or deplete under 10 to protect the battery. Call quality is good, speaker is loud enough, screen size and colors are great. Camera is just okay, when you really blow up images, the detail is not there. Although I'm comparing to a Pixel 2, so can't expect it. Performance is fine and never noticed any slow functions. I do not game, so no review on gaming.Phone has many bands and have used it in USA and all over Asia with multiple sims and works very well.  Dual sim feature is nice to have."
2834,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Great camera
2835,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I got this and it don't work.  It won't turn on.  They are sending me another one and ifnit don't work I am done with it.
2836,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Great great
2837,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Nothing bad to say except I wish the case that came with it was a hard case. The case is so flimsy. It won't stop it from being damaged if I drop it.
2838,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I love this phone comparing it to the a13 or a11 this phone is way better specs memory and all the specs are great not quite 90hz but the screen is cinimatic viewing beautiful you will enjoy paying games on this device and watching movies and the colors are beautiful love the camera hdr mode and just the detail all the specs you need. Giving this a 5 stars also seller is fast shipping got mine the next day. I really love this device. Good price too
2839,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I am happy with this phone, it is cheap but very nice and fast, the battery lasts a long time"
2840,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I usually wait a whole month after purchasing a phone to review but I've had this phone for only 4 days and I hate it!! When i saw all of these 5 star reviews i was very skeptical because this brand never gets more than 3 stars and now i see why! First, the sound is horrible, so low that whenever I watched a video or movie i had to bring the phone close to my face to be able to hear correctly! I always used closed caption because the sound is unbelievably low!! While watching videos the images often would become very pixilated. The front camera is terrible too! Also whenever a call comes in while im doing something on my phone, the caller ID isn't displayed and I'm unable to answer the call! There are a few other annoying things but those were the most bothersome for me and because of that I'm not keeping this phone and I'll never purchase this brand again!!"

2847,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"I broke my Samsung while visiting NYC and bought this one as a temporary substitute but I fell in love with its battery life. The camera is amazing for cell phone photography. It is very easy to use and responds promptly. The only problem I had with it was when I returned to Turkey and tried to install a Turk Telekom SIM into it. The phone didn't respond to that. I wonder if it works outside the U.S. If not, my money is wasted because I do not live in the U.S. I took a star out for that :("
2848,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"I just got the phone a couple of days ago but have been using it constantly and putting it to the test a lot in the last 48 hours.  It feels really nice in the hand and has a fairly premium feel to it despite it being very budget friendly.  Love the large screen.  The facial recognition and fingerprint sensor are perfect... they both work really well and i have not had any trouble with either one.  It's got android 12 which is cool and fun to use.  I love that you can take a picture using the fingerprint sensor... excellent idea and makes it so much easier than having to worm your thumb around to hit the button on the screen .. esp. with a large phone like this.  Lots of little extras that you can discover if you spend some time playing around with it. The downside is that it is a bit on the slow side.  It definitely does lag when opening apps .. some apps take longer than others.  Scrolling thru Twitter and Instagram is bumpy at best.  Other applications on the phone like settings, contacts, email, messages, etc, seem to scroll just fine.  But not a super quick phone if that is what you are looking for.  That said, you can get used to pretty much anything and for the money this is a pretty solid device.  I've had two other TCL phones and liked them both very much.  This one is my favorite size-wise, but the other two models had faster processors.  Screen colors are pretty nice.  Photos aren't bad.  The camera seems improved over the TCL 20s which is the other model i own.  Not a point and shoot camera - you have to take at least a couple of shots to get it perfectly clear and focused, in my experience.  All in all fairly pleased with it.  Early days so time will tell but as of right now it's not bad.  Battery life is great.  With moderate use you will definitely get a full day and then some."
2849,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"The phone I was using prior to this one was slowing down a bit and also the battery life seems to be draining faster, as well as charging slower. I bought this phone thinking I'd be getting a bit of an upgrade, but it's not a great phone, honestly. The speakers are awful and the processor is the worst - my two main qualms. Otherwise, it pretty much functions like any other phone. I've been debating just switching my service back to my old phone but then I wouldn't know what to do with this one since I can no longer return it. I mostly bought it because it was slightly bigger than my previous phone but honesty... There's hardly a difference. Major pass on this product.Update: TCL Direct-US reached out and sent me a very kind response per the review I've left stating my disappointment. They offered to provide a full refund for my purchase. I have been using this phone still during this time and I'd say that it's still a functional phone despite my opinion on specifics. I am comparing it to a phone I used to use prior to this one which I found to be comparable, whilst looking for an upgrade without breaking the bank. This phone may not have been what I was looking for, but it could very well be what you are looking for. I think many people would be satisfied with purchasing this phone. Regardless, I find TCL's customer service to be excellent, attentive, and friendly and I am happy with my experience in the end."
2850,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Did I mention ***** AWESOME ***** [My first cell was the original brick phone - yeah I'm that old]  Not much impresses me any more!!  â€¢ This is likely the best phone yet. Hands down, beats Samsung to aPple, (but two cups and a string is better than iCrÂ°p.) I've owned them all. I have not wanted anything that this device did not have. I loaded my favorite launcher, keyboard, and other background OS controls. (Can't do any of that on an iThing - LoL) Did I mention ***** AWESOME *****"
2851,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Cons,The screen is not pure inky black and has poor side viewing.The cameras are not world class.Feels sluggish at times.You need high sensitivity, low impedance headphones to get the most out of the 3.5mm headphone jackPROsThe screen gets BRIGHT, and when looking at the phone head on, it is vivid and clearThe camera app is intuitive, easy to use, and pro mode is a bunch of fun... for me anyway!after 3-4 hours of updates, disabling\removing bloatware and unwanted programs, the phone feels responsive and I'm able to play hill climb racing 2 without any hiccups.As a phone goes, everyone says my voice is clear, not much low end in the ear speaker from the other person, but it goes loud and it is clear, same goes for the stereo speakers at the bottom, speakerphone works well, there is no time warp delay, or hearing yourself when you call.I believe I have actually upgraded my phone, as a phone. My note 20 ultra 5g SUCKED as a phone constantly dropping calls.This phone feels premium in the had and the cameras are protected by the thinnest of phone cases. the clear included case works perfectly fine!______________________________________________________________________________I am very happy with it, overall.10/10 FOR PRICE/PERFORMANCEwould recommend this phone to anyone who does not care if things are INSTANT. I think they used SLOW lpddr, paired with slow mmlc 64GB creating a unique bandwidth problem. The pages scroll much better after things are loaded. (I'm using the phone for texting, conference, and yep, phone calls all are instant with no lag whatsoever, same with home-screen/phone/settings navigation all really smooth)"
2852,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"I had recently bought a new car(Subaru Crosstrek) and I bought this for the primary purpose of using it with Android Auto since my older phone was so spotty with mobile data that it could not keep a constant connection during my trips.My early impressions have been mostly positive with this phone. The phone feels premium in the hand with a nice, large screen and every function that I have tried so far has worked smoothly.Battery life is better than my previous phone but isn't as good as I had expected during actual usage(after about half a day of moderate-heavy usage the battery is already down to about 40%).Overall though I am very pleased with this phone as it operates smoothly and feels nice in the hand but most importantly it works without a hitch with Android Auto."
2853,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"PROS: Fast, 6MB RAM, good battery life, decent display, fingerprint and face recognition, good camera and camera options (50mp and macro options), add'l storage option, earjack plugin, case included, pretty easy setup, great price.CONS: No 5G or some financial app functions, but I don't need it and it's not really that available in many places. Slightly larger than expected, but pretty ergonomic, so no biggie. Telephoto not available in 50mp mode, a minor disappointment.I bought for $151, outstanding camera for the price!"
2854,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,Decent budget phone had a mind of is own like putting itself into braille mode and took a few hours to get it back to normal and the touch screen defenetly had issue more times then not
2855,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Arrived in undamaged box, but screen has damage right from the fact.Purchased new, not refurbished, should not have been sent a detective phone.Did activate it because I needed a phone, and still do!Also, phone reboots randomly and rejects updates.  Phone updated, all updates appeared on screen, but when I reboot the phone, it reverted to original configuration without being reset.Screen damage not caused by me or by abuse. Display is really nice and phone processes quickly, but cannot get around receiving what appears to be a refurb, when I bought direct from Amazon as a full price new phone.Returning for credit, will likely buy a different brand...one with hardened glass screen.I never thought that a manufacturer like TCL would hide the fact the screen is plastic, and flimsy enough that something in the box tapped the screen during shipping (charger?) only to expose that the screen is not hardened glass.The reboot loss of updates issue effects functionality."
2856,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"It's everything that I was looking for. My 6 year old lost his phone and it was time to visit Dad so I purchased the he TCL. It works great for him. He can play games, watch Netflix and call me.I noticed that it runs a little slower than I'd like but for the price who's fussing.It was a great buy for us."
2857,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"I picked this up for Google Fi because I didn't want to spend 500 to 800 dollars on a phone that was only a bit better. This was a fantastic choice. The camera is infinitely better than a phone I got from Motorola for 200 dollars. It runs awesome, the screen looks great, it sounds good. All in all I really like it and hope that it continues to work for me for years to come."
2858,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,You can tell it's not a Samsung the ui is not as fluid perfect for me cuz I don't need to spend big money on phone you will need to restart this phone every couple days I've had for 2 months and it works well I had Samsung a21 from bout 4 years before and it's bout as good as that but in newer model can't find anything this good for less than 300 to 500 in my opinion I'm happy I activated through straight talk if want know how it pretty simple
2859,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Got it for my mom. Almost better than my iPhone. Huge screen with great resolution and colors. Not 5G capable but a great phone that can do as much and even more than my iPhone albeit more slowly because the processor seems weaker. Still, if you get this phone you will be quite impressed for the cost."
2860,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Had to do a return. First phone that I got has a bad memory and I had to do a hard restore to get it to work, and then continued to have issues. Lost some photos that were not backed up.  The replacement phone has had no issues and is working as expected.  Camera is good, could be a little better for nightime shots.  Good size and good speed for good enough (lower powered) graphic games.  Bright and clear display. Audio is good for the price. Used a TMobile reseller for minimal anual amount and should be good for emergency uses and or when primary phone battery dies."
2861,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Don't do it.EDIT 7-14-22:  this afternoon TCL/Amazon combined the 20se with the 30xl page so that suddenly it looks like this unimpressive, laggy, newly released 30XL (with 13 reviews, mainly negative) somehow shot up to 2658 positive reviews in one day. Seems a bit underhanded, doesn't it? Let these actions guide your decision to purchase from this company that wants your data.  END EDITDon't do it.I know the price is tempting. There may even be a 15% off coupon. But this is a really bad choice for a phone. Even setting aside their privacy policy - FWIW the first time that I ever read one that I instinctively thought was more intrusive than Google. Go look it up. They monitor EVERYTHING -the phone itself isn't impressive for too long after you press the power button.I ordered this because my old Moto G from 2020 can't keep the charging cable attached any longer.  I'm a thrifty guy who still enjoys tech, and I thought I'd found a hidden gem in the TCL. The price was right and it was a modern phone from a reputable manufacturer, and overseas reviews were fairly positive, so I thought I'd give it a try.When the 30XL arrived I was excited, and I thought I'd stick with it even after being disturbed by the privacy policy since I needed a new phone immediately. Be sure to read it, though. Wow.I got everything loaded up and... Wait, is something wrong?  Why is this brand new phone slower than my two or three year old $180 Moto G? Maybe it's updating. No, it's just slow. Wow, it's REALLY slow. You'll see if you order one. It lags from the start.Sure enough, I looked up a comparison of the processor in this 30XL (Helio G25) to the outdated but decent snapdragon 655 in my cheapo Moto G, and this 2-years newer phone is humiliated by the old Motorola.TCL? That's not how this is supposed to work, guys.Well, at least the display is better. Oh, wait. Never mind. It's a 720 display. Huh. So it's slower than the old Moto G I'm replacing, and the display looks worse, AND it's already lagging before I've even loaded any programs on it. And all for $200.I sent it back. This is unacceptable, even at this price point, and consumers should reject this silliness lest manufacturers believe it should become their standard for quality.Avoid if it costs more than $100 or so. You'll be disappointed if you've ever had another phone. You've been warned. You're probably better off finding a used Galaxy S10 or 2nd generation IPhone SE or something else in this price range but still capable of adequately performing routine tasks.Again, avoid.EDIT: I don't get anything for free for being a ""top reviewer in men's gloves size L"" or anything like that, but please click the helpful button if you found this helpful so we can get this to the top and save everyone a bunch of time and money. I can't imagine the hours and gas wasted by tens of thousands of people like me who think they've found their Moto G Power replacement but who will end up returning it. Thanks."
2862,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,10/21/22 Update: So far so good.  No other issues and increase to 4 stars.WAS:Reasonable low-cost phone.  Got it working with H2O Wireless reasonably fast! But disappointed there is no WiFi calling.  My older Redmi 6 pro had this function. Device to device requires a USB cable should be documented.  I have to start fresh.
2863,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"For the price of the phone I was stoked for what I was getting out the box.. big screen, big battery, decent stereo sound from the speakers, but what I soon found out was that the battery wasn't quite working with this phone. I reached out to TCL and explained my issue and they immediately sent me out a replacement phone to make things right. When I received the new phone I checked again to make sure all was working correctly and it wasn't. Frustrated and wondering what was going on I reached out to TCL yet again and explained to them that not one but both phones were no good. TCL was super helpful and friendly with their customer service that a manger was spoken to about my problems and a solution was brought to my attention. They upgraded me from the 30 XL to the 20 Pro 5G phone free of charge for the inconveniences I may have encountered. I was truly grateful for this offer and they were super nice about the whole ordeal. Although the 30 XL wasn't working right the fact that TCL not only sent me a second replacement phone but to upgrade me to another phone without hesitation shows how much they care for their customers. So one bad phone doesn't make this a bad company. I'm now happy with my phone and happy with their customer service."
2864,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,So far I have only used the finger print and number code. I haven't used the face recognition yet. The battery life seems to be very good. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't have a call screening feature that I had on my previous cellphone. Maybe they'll look into that. I am happy with everything else.
2865,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"I absolutely love the battery life. It is an all day device absolutely. The thing I do find strange however Is that very little info exists about this model and it looks just like the tcl 30 SE. But had its own unique packaging. Just a weird  qualm I had with it. Also I couldn't find it listed anywhere, could the seller list weather this is a 32 or 64 bit phone. Absolutely worth the price on sale."
2866,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"At first I was apprehensive about the whole phone, took a lil bit to set up the first time but after that, itâ€™s smooth sailing, super user friendly great camera software easy to edit pics,love the screen size fits in pockets very well.I was impressed by the battery my prev droid killed my battery while using Netflix, easy to get use to many options for security with or without face recognition or thumb print."
2867,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Easy to use , big screen and good resolution and convenient price50mp camera and 13mp front camera !"
2868,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"A gift and not fully put to any tests in realtime but as a gift, the receiver is quite happy with everything about it (though if upgrading, there may be a slight learning curve w/features). This previous owner of a Xiaomi smartphone considers the images (graphics) in her minor game-playing excellent on the larger screen."
2869,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,Very nice phone for everyday use such as watching videos reading and sending emails making and receiving phone calls.
2870,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,Great phone with not much bloateware. Stock android with TCL UI. Feels premium and everything just works great. HD and WiFi calling. Happy with this purchase.
2871,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,I'm very pleased with this phone. I upgraded from a previous Android version and I'm glad that I did. Would recommend this to anyone and the price is very easy to live with.
2872,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"this is the phone if one is almost out of a coverage area, while the Cubot X30, Redmi 11 pro, Umidigi A13 pro, A9 pro pulled in my location below 1Mb/sec on mobile data, the TCL went up to 20 Mb/sec !!! also the reception on bluetooth and Wifi is outstanding, what is missing is the 2nd mic for video in stereo, it has 2 speakers but only one mic!!!!, the camera is very good, actually better even than the Redmi 11 Pro with 108 Mpix, The only negative is that it says charger incompatible even with the charger which came with it, but it still charges"
2873,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,What I like: It's a big phone. The finger print sensor works well and it's in the rear. Mine came with a gel case.What I don't like: The Bluetooth doesn't always connect. The Auto light sensor can't seem to make up its mind weather to adjust to the right brightness or not. You can't turn of Google sync. There's no light up dot to let you know there's a message when the screen is locked. Some bloatware you can't uninstall. Very glitchy at times and slow. The TCL 20S is a better phone. Consider buying that before this one.
2874,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,Phone is a little big for my small hands. So far so good no complaints.
2875,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,I reordered and had to pay shipping. It corrupted itself. I reset and it never worked well after. So this is second time around. It's a nice phone. Takes beautiful pics. The size is good for me and light enough. I have arthritis. So if any problems arise again. I will right a new review.
2876,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"I used up 20GB right away from updates, but 40GB is a good amount. The screen size is awesome. The RAM speeds make it really fast and smooth when navigating through things. The only stutters were when I was installing and downloading updates while swiping through a webpage.Only downside is that there aren't that many ""Heavy-duty"" cases for this phone (It's the equivalent of a TCL 20se. The 20se has an extra button on the left side, and the 30XL does not. The case would still fit for the right side power and volume buttons.) A heavy duty case is important because it is essentially a cheaper substitute for a warranty.I bought the phone anyway, and I am pleased so far. I will be putting a 12 month Mint service sim in it because Mint is GSM."
2877,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,Everything I hoped for
2878,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Excellent camera quality, phone reception, large display screen, tons of storage, and easy to use!!!"
2879,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,You get a Ferrari for the price of a Volkswagen.
2880,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,Awesome phone really love it. The battery life is great I listen to podcast all day long (12hrs) I'm YouTube and more then half the battery remains. The image resolution is amazing as well as personal videos and pictures.
2881,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"This 2nd comment on item---Now have brightness and several others corrected (MYfault). Now have it hooked to a MVNO after 1st failed because of complexity (NOT my fault). Phone deserves a good rating now. Large screen, Android up to date and good. With two weeks using it, the only things that reduce it froma five star to a four is speakers/sound. My OPINION on this phone---worth buying."

2888,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"TL is making an amazing set of phones for really good breakthrough prices.  I happened upon the brand when seardhing separately for inexpenive phones with great battery life.  My iphone hand-me-down from my wife, a 7plus, really was poor on battery life and it drove me crazy, which is why I sought something with really good battery life.  In practice, however, thie 30XL battery life, which pretty good, was not as good as advertised.  The battery life, however, generally did fit my needs for sure.  My problems with the phone are several.  I was not able to enable WiFi calling, and now I find that a number of the TCL phones to not permit WiFi calling except with certain carriers.  Bummer.  There were many features I really liked but one problem I couldn't live with.  When texting I had to take extreme care to not hit the lower margin of the space bar or the punctuation boxes.  If I was a bit low it took me completely out of the text screen to one of several others and I had to then search again for the text function and go back and find where I had been.  I found this intolerable and it may well be that somehow it can be overcome with an internal OS adjustment.  I don't have the time or energy to go through all of that, so I was within the return window and I did return it.  Today I ordered the TCL 10L, which appears to have wonderful features and is an upgrade from the 30XL.  I would very much like the 20Pro but didn't want the 300 price tag.  Ii got the bundle with the ear buds so we'll see how all that works.  Sincerely hope this helps someone."
2889,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Actually is a very good phone. I really havent found a downside to it. If youre looking for a very up to date phone, with alot of the newest features, but at a lower cost, this phone is it. I suppose if i had to dig for a fault it would be that its hard to find info about this phone online. Almost like it never existed"

2896,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Update:TCL reached out to me and took steps to right the situation. Their customer service is fantastic. Thank you for helping make things right.The phone is slow and laggy, freezes often and is just underwhelming. I've hade cheaper phones with less ram preform better. Sound quality is poor, even for a budget phone. Had a recent update that seemed to help a little."
2897,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"Those product works well, I'm writing those review on it. Main problem is that the screen isn't as durable as the WP 5. Already has scratches whereas I still have the older model and screen still has no scratches. Fingerprint reader sometimes doesn't read, but works most of the time. Increase of processing speed is nice however"

2899,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I like the size of the screen, the tough exterior, and the overall look of it. But the finger print feature don't work also the face recognition isn't working as well, otherwise it's a nice phone."
2900,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I bought this phone solely because of the advertised battery life. Now I'm not an avid phone user, but I do use my phone for texting a lot, and for light gaming (no graphic intensive titles, mostly word and puzzle games), but this battery has lasted me a full work week (5 days), and more. The most days without charging I've gotten out of this phone is 10 days (mostly on standby, but a bit of texting and a bit of gaming). Performance wise I'm coming from the 6th generation of an iOS device, so the performance of this phone is far and BEYOND my expectations. The phone doesn't lag, and responds very quickly. It also does not come with any bloatware, but the default Goggle set of apps. You definitely will not get a phone with the impressive specs (128GB storage, 8GB RAM, octa-core processor, AND either dual SIM tray, or single SIM and micro SD for EXTRA storage capacity). What iPhone or Galaxy (or other Android flagship phone) can boast those specs for less than $300?? Definitely 100% recommend this phone, but for those people who don't care for a THICK, heavier than normal, simple to use cell phone. If sleek and weightless is what you're seeking, look elsewhere."
2901,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,Best phone for a man that's always outdoors
2902,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"This is only an initial review after about a week's worth of use, but so far so good. First and foremost, it's big. And it's heavy. It makes my old Pixel phone look like a dwarf. But the battery went three days without charging and still had juice. It was easy to transfer everything from my old phone, and it works fine on Verizon."
2903,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I've only been using this phone for a few days, but so far, it's definitely a great phone. It's fast, reliable, and with the 256gb memory card, it's pretty much a flagship quality phone. I usually buy whatever is the newest, most feature packed phone that's currently out, and I've owned more than 1 flagship model. I've got to say that this phone will keep up with any of them, and it has night vision too! I'll update as time passes, but so far, as long as you don't mind carrying a big, heavy phone, then this could be the phone you're looking for. Can't fault the size or weight because of the crazy big battery, so for now I have nothing negative to say about it."
2904,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,This phone is amazing it has a little of everything. If your a camper it's got tools for you a student it's got you covered to..a contractor yep you too. It even has those pesky picture hanging nightmares taken care of. And so much memory it's unbelievable. I absolutely recommend this phone if you are tired of buying a new one all the time cause your screen breaks this bad boy holds up.
2905,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"tl;Dr: great phone for the price, not rugged, extremely bass-y over BluetoothI upgraded to this phone from the wp5 of the same product line (still working great, just slow). At first it seemed better in every way but with use I found 2 major issues. The first one is that the Bluetooth turns the bass well past 11 which means I still carried the wp5 around if I wanted music, podcasts or whatever.  The second(and deal breaker for me) is that the durability has significantly dropped off since the wp5.  Keeping this in my back pocket just like I still do with the wp5 caused the corner of the screen to pop out of the frame.  To be fair it still works and I can probably disassemble it and get it popped back in to place, but any faith I had in this phone reliably surving my work environment is completely gone and I've already gone back to using the wp5 at work until I find a different replacement. If you are fine with slow I'd still recommend the wp5 but for someone like me who looks for durability first the wp16 is no good."
2906,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"My kid had an earlier model that didn't have infrared and only about half the memory. He loved that phone and loved this one even more. It's heavy AF and I wonder whether he'll get carpal tunnel and if I'll have to reinforce his pockets, but he's in absolute love with this phone.These phones are damn near indestructible, but he managed to shatter the screen of his previous Oukitel to the point that the front facing camera component showed. I hope this one fares better ğŸ¤·."

2910,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"The usb-c connection for charging didn't last even a year. I've been careful with all my phones. Its loose, so I have to have it connected a certain way in order for it to charge. I used to like it a lot until that issue came upon."
2911,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,its a really good phone for the price runs most games i try the only reason i gave it a 4 is minor glitches like hard to click top of screen sound only coming from front speaker and don't receive messages from Facebook messenger until i unlock phone but all of this stuff barely happens
2912,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,I liked all the features it had and the long battery life. However it didn't work with Comcast my phone carrier.
2913,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"The Ouketil WP 16 seems to be a great phone, I live out in the country and and I get 5 bars.

This is supposed to be IP69K dust resistant... I have engaged support on their website and included my amazon order number, and they GHOSTed me/no response. This is a cheap Chinese knock off with no support behind the actual product. Buyer beware."

RETURNING! Even the keyboard is STUPID no caps lock or options to change it to a keyboard that doesn't suck!Almost forgot, there's this stupid Google search and a day and date on the middle of my home screen that CANNOT BE REMOVED, THAT IS GOING TO FORCE ME TO RETURN THIS SUPER STUPID PHONE I HATE HATE HATE THAT THE MOST!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2917,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,I got the phone wet and the screen is fried. It works well for a light. The screen is black. So not as waterproof as it says. Be careful of what you read

2923,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"Overall is wrong from not fast enough but just a job done and we'll get you out of being stranded pretty quickly at least the stranding is because of a low battery. Seems to have an older version of Android that doesn't work particularly well but it's functional and you can use it pretty much as fast as you would a phone from 3 or 4 years ago. The extra features are nice but I rarely use them but having been in the forest in the middle of the night having the camera with the infrared light does help see wherever you need to see. I keep this phone as a second phone because I never know when my first phone a brand new pixel pro 6 will run out of battery and leave me stranded, it does that job well and even works really good Wi-Fi hotspot not particularly fast but it has enough battery that it will work for about 6 hours of that. Does not charge fast expect when you get down to zero battery to take about 8 to 16 hours to fully charge with even a high-powered charger. Max is about 10 watts charging. But most the time I'm charging from 50 to 60% and it takes about 6 hours. Screen has a protector on it from the factory and that scratched up pretty quick I've left it on until I get a new screen protector but the screen is taking plenty of abuse and never had any sort of problem"

2926,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"After the first one was stolen in the shipping process, the Oukitel distributor sent me another one. I really like the phone. Well made. Just received it today, so it hasn't been put to the test yet. However, the speed of the operating system is great. The only thing I would change is the power button location. It sits right where my thumb rest, causing me to accidently close the screen if I'm not paying attention. I wish it was placed higher up on the phone. That bugs me because I always use long passwords instead of the fingerprint, facial recognition, or number code. The speaker on this phone blows my last phone and several other previous phones outta the water too. I'm not a gamer so can't comment on gaming abilities for the phone."
2927,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I am very pleased with this seletion of tuff phone..! It is heavy, so if you need a phone for just the every day jog or just that important tie to the office's need to reach you, this phone is much to qualified for any of that sort of thing.. This is by all means a tuff cellphone.. The discription surrounding this cell phone does not do it any justice, because this phone is what you would want out in the field where normal cell phones would not stand a chance.. It has to be the best cell phone if by chance you find your self in a battle field and in a position where this phone's dependability is what you are betting on to save yourself.. I love it if you can't tell by now..! I don't care where I am, I can depend on this phone to get me in touch with anyone and everyone.. It has a lot of great apps and it is capable of expansion with added memory cards if you are planning to use it's cameras for a lot of photos on the go.. I have not had the moment yet to try it's nite photography but if it's like everything else this phone is, I'm sure it will be just as great or more than I will maybe ever need... I rate it a ten. Oh yea the battery life is just as awesome as well, it seems to never need a charge ..."

2929,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I have had this just over a week now and I am impressed. I usually go with contract phones and pay way too much.This is dual sim with space for an sd card too. Transerring data and apps from old to new phone was fairly painless but always takes longer that you expect and can be stressful if you have not done it before. But got there in the endNow about the phone it comes with a clear silicon sleeve which fits well and feels good in the hand. The phone is light as it is predominalty plastic but does not feel cheap.The battery life is excellent and the finger print recognition is best I have ever used. I have also ativated facial recognition which is great for me when the phone is picked up it comes to life and facial recognition is almost instant. (Covid face mask not with standing). There are menus and features on this phone that I have never come across before which makes navigating down into them somewhat labourious not helped by the usual lack of a manual (so far not been able to get one) hence the four stars.The processor is fast and it will be interesting to see if it remains so once all the usual app paraphernalia are loaded.The camera is good and takes excellent pictures and video, it is possible to remove the oukitel branding from photos but as stated above finding this in the depthe of the menus took most of the week. The upside is any photo you send say in whatsapp does not have the branding attached to it. The is no gallery icon for photos (or not found it yet) all photos are held under an icon called files where most things sit. I use google photos so not a major issue. I have given four stars instead of five because of the lack of information manual nad the large number of menus and sub menus associated with this phone. I promise to master all of it before I die."
2930,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"This is my second Oukitel 'phone having previously purchased the K3 around 30 months ago which I did find a little heavy in weight, although again a very good product.  The Y4800 is much lighter in weight and perfect for a jacket pocket even in a secondary case.  The improved operating system using android 9 is very useful.  I managed to copy all my data from my old device using Google Drive without any problems.The Y4800 has 6 GB of RAM which is excellent as well as the 128 GB of internal storage there is also the facility for an SD card as well as the two nano SIM cards which I make use of. However, it does not have NFC which I would have liked, but, when you consider the price of the device I am pleased with the purchase.  Camera quality is acceptable.  I use the Y4800 for streaming music, making 'phone calls, messaging and everyday internet use, including using gmail with little problem via both WiFi and data connection over 4G.  With it's LTE facility I have little problem getting a connection.  Again set up of my data connection was extremely easy copying all relevant settings via the blue tooth facility from the K3.A very good 'phone excellent value for money with all the benefits of Android 9.  Light in and on the 'pocket' (or in hand of course) at 176 grams with nifty operating speed at around 2 ghz. with quad cores. My home Wifi 'pulls' at circa 55 meg and 'pushes' at just over 20meg with this product.  A great device when you just need to check something quickly without having to strain your eyes by courtesy of it's 6.3 inch screen or spending time performing the 'admin' tasks that modern life now seems to throw at us increasingly.  The thickness of the phone is 8.1mm which is 'up there' with other well known brands that cost considerably more money.  I cannot find fault with the Y4800 and would recommend the product."

Ohne groÃŸe Erwartungen entdeckte ich unter Blitzangebote dieses Teil, dazu noch ein Rabattgutschein um 20â‚¬, da habe ich ""zugeschlagen"". 2 Tage spÃ¤ter traf das GerÃ¤t bereits bei mir ein. Es beeindruckte mich sofort, keine MÃ¤ngel festzustellen, alles eingestellt, alle Apps heruntergeladen, alles funktioniert zu meiner vollsten Zufriedenheit und das superschnell. Die Kamera macht ausgezeichnete Bilder und Videos, der Akku reicht mindestens 1 Woche bei fÃ¼r mich bei normaler Nutzung (ich bin kein Freak!) meiner 30 Apps. Noch habe ich keinen einzigen Bug gefunden, Android 10 lÃ¤uft ohne eine Macke, sogar ein Sicherheitsupdate war gleich abrufbar. Voll kompatibel mit Google Play Store.

Toller WLAN-Empfang. Eine Projektion des gesamten Handybildschirms auf meinen riesigen TV-Apparat funktioniert mit einem Klick, einfach super. Einziger kleiner Nachteil ist das Ladekabel, denn alle meine alten Kabel passen da nicht mehr! Leider ist auch keine versprochene Displayschutzfolie angebracht oder dabei, was mich schon etwas Ã¤rgert! Aber der Kundendienst hat mir geschrieben, dass mir eine Folie nachgeschickt wird?

The Huawei 1gb RAM  had stopped receiving updates and some apps were hard to get operating with a lot of jiggery. I couldn't add new apps without deleting others due to RAM space.Pleased with this item as it has a large RAM at 6gb and 128 gb storage.  Easy enough to use although I somehow couldn't find they keypad to dial out, I may have deleted it along with the google dross I was ditching. Anyway found a dialer in the play store and all sorted.Not too much bloatware pre installed , that's good.I only have a couple of minor gripes, I miss the little flashing LEDs the Huawei had telling me I had a message or email etc. without having to pick the phone up and pin in to see.Also , I really miss instructions. I couldn't even find an online manual. Never mind though, a great product . Super large screen stacks of memory.  Why would anyone bother with an Apple?"

Very good value for money, easily on par with all the current leading phone manufacturers for less than half the price the only 2 negatives i have about the Y8001: is although still a very reasonable camera it isn't quite the 48MP as claimed but again for a mobile phone camera is plenty sufficient..2: the camera lenses and LED flash light section of the device sits proud from the rest of the device, so when putting the phone down over time gradually scratches the lenses which then obviously degrades the actual picture quality, but this luckily can be avoided buy purchasing the phone case dedicated for this model which is fitted with a very practical 360Â° swivel stand & car air vent mount which then illiminates this from happening so id highly recommend this is purchased along with the device which is also a very reasonable price. All in all id give this device a well deserved 9\10. ğŸ‘"
2936,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"This is a pretty good smartphone. The screen is bright and clear with this amount of memory and storage apps run quickly.I am impressed by how well it picks up 4G - I am getting 59mbps download speed on Giffgaff in a city centre location which is better than my previous phone..No problems hooking up to WiFi and the location stuff works great with Google maps and Sygic.Overall, I am very impressed.--Edit--I forgot to mention the camera.. The main camera in this phone is pretty good. The standard camera app includes some nice bits like slow-motion video and settings for night, panorama, portrait and others - for getting a bit more serious I popped the Lightroom app on and use the camera in that.Images are sharp, colours are rendered well and there is very little lag between pressing the shutter button and the photo being taken.I didn't bother taking my camera on holiday last week and relied on the camera in this phone - I got some fairly decent pictures.."
2937,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,I cannot fault this phone for the price you pay it is fast 6 GB Ram it has lots of storage 128 GB and it supports all the APPS i need like Facebook Instagram etc.It looks and feels like a more expensive phone and for a tenth of the price of the latest Samsung i cannot see why you would not buy this phone.One thing to be aware of is that i could not get 4G at first you need to go into settings and find ACCESS POINT NAMES(ATP) under advanced settings and manually put in your service provider details. I just googled Virgin Media ATP and it came up with all the settings to manually enter i saved these and works perfectly. Some providers will automatically load into ATP on your phone but for some reason Virgin did not.
2938,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"It's a great great phone! I was pleasantly surprised by it - though it's a larger phone than my old one it's quite light which is perfect as I have small hands. The RAM is impressive, nothing freezes and it works really well and quick. The quality of the camera and video is also really great -much better than my old Samsung phone. The best feature for me was the huge capacity of the memory, I don't need to agonise over how many apps I can keep or choosing which family pictures and videos I need to delete because of the extremely limited storage. I was a little skeptic about sourcing my phone from a company that wasn't Samsung, IPhone or Sony but I can say with full confidence that I do not regret switching and the purchase I have made."
2939,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"GiÃ  avuto 3 Oukitel l'ultimo il K8. In merito al C21 come agli altri posseduti precedentemente non posso che esprimermi positivamente in merito al rapporto qualitÃ  prezzo sono telefoni affidabili e duraturi(li cambio solo per aggiornarmi con le nuove tecnologie) riguardo il C21 ottima fluiditÃ  con il nuovo OS buono il fingerprint e il riconoscimento faciale anche in oscuritÃ (si accende il display illuminando il volto) devo ora valutare con calma le funzionalitÃ  della video camera che appare comunque molto migliorata anche se nei notturni(vista la fascia medio/bassa) lascia a desiderare ma per poco piÃ¹ di 100â‚¬ cosa si puÃ² chiedere?? E un grazie ad Amazon che in un pugno di giorni consegna con tutte le garanzie legali UE, considerando che la casa madre offre dal 11 novembre c.a. il C21 a poco piÃ¹ di 90â‚¬(aliexpress) ma arriva dalla cina quindi tempi lunghi, incognita garanzia e non trascurabile dogane Italy(vedi dazi) quindi se interessati al C21 acquistate al volo su Amazon."
2940,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I've had the phone for a good couple of months and I have no complaints, I wish I could purchase a really rugged case for it but there isn't much available, but the screen is amazing and it's faster than most phones I have owned, don't be put off by the make, it's specifications are high for the price and I'm happy with the purchase"
2941,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I am a bit of a fan of these Chinese phones, I had an Oukitel K7000 Pro for a couple of years which never caused any problems and to be honest if I hadn't cracked the screen I would still be using it. To replace that I bought  CUBOT phone which to be honest was more than a bit 'average' but I managed to loose it over Christmas so I went back to OUKITEL.So far so great, latest Android release, easy setup, good camera, responsive, and pretty slick in all round operation. You can get better phones yes but you'll struggle to get close to this for Â£170!You aren't going to impress any teenagers but meh, well worth a go however in the value for money arena."
2942,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I refuse to spend several hundred pounds on a smartphone or get a contract that costs Â£50 a month just to get one. This phone has been great as far as i'm concerned. Calls ok, texts and messages absolutely fine. Quick connection when i need Uber or to check train times. 128Gb storage so i doubt i'll ever need any more. Battery life is good too but i don't stream a lot of videos/music.  Had this for a few months and had no problems at all. In my experience there's always going to be someone who has problems with smartphones no matter what the make - this one's been fine."
2943,OUKITEL,WP16,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I've been using this phone for a good few months and I'm really impressed. I was a lifelong apple user but the price tags are absurd now so after struggling through other android brands to find something decent I've finally found one and I'll never go back. It's easy to use, it's fast, runs games and multiple apps with no problem .Built in call recorder , WiFi and Bluetooth settings very simple for connecting various smart devices speakers etcNO NASTY POP UPS FROM MANUFACTURERSCamera quality is good, probably not as good as the very expensive phones but it's more than adequate"

Fotos sind bei guter Beleuchtung auch gut (siehe Foto vom Gartenzwerg).Was man hier fÃ¼r um die Hundert Euro bekommt, ist der reine Wahnsinn. Echt!Einzig das KunststoffgehÃ¤use muss sich im Alltag noch bewÃ¤hren, was die StabilitÃ¤t betrifft.Eine SchutzhÃ¼lle ist allerdings schon dabei.Und man muss bedenken, dass hier ein komplett neues Smartphone weniger kostet, als eine Display-Reperatur beim XR.

2947,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,"I thought I had the original My Flip before being handed a company iPhone at a news agency I worked. In any case, I had one that was very similar, and it was from Alcatel. I missed that little phone the whole time I had the iPhone, which I never warmed to because it I knew I'd have to give it back one day.That day came, and I knew I wanted a pre-paid Tracfone and Googled ""Tracfone."" This was one of the first things I saw, and I was like ""My old phone!"" I didn't even look at anything else. I read a lot of reviews that mention difficulty with setting it up. I had no trouble. In fact, it all felt so familiar. But I had an advantage. I bought it a whole week before I had to give up the iPhone, so I had plenty of time to set it up the way I wanted before registering it.I guess this would be classified as a dumb phone, but I'd call it more of a hybrid smart/dumb phone. It does have some smartphone capabilities, like talk-to-text using Google Assistant. It also comes preloaded with some decent apps. I'm on Facebook a lot, and there's an app for that, which I appreciate. There's also a little suite of Google apps, including Google Maps, Google Assistant, the Google search engine, and YouTube. Browsing the internet is a pain because you have to use the number pad to navigate. But some of the preloaded, apps as well as some that I downloaded from the KaiOS app store, provide a slightly more user-friendly experience and are designed for small screens.When I think about the iPhone, I know I didn't tap into half of what it was capable of. But everything I did with it I can also do with the My Flip 2: make calls, send texts, send and receive pics and videos, check my mail, and surf the net. If texting with the number pad was the only option, that would be frustrating, but I'm used to it and use it for quick texts and responses. But Google Assistant is super easy to use and convenient. When you're in the text field, press and hold the center OK button until Google Assistant comes on. Say exactly what you want the text to say, then hit send.As part of my daily routine now, I turn on the activity tracker I downloaded from the app store so I can log the number of miles I walk per day, turn on the phone's FM radio, tune into my favorite local jazz station, and head out the door. The activity tracker gives me updates on my progress about every 20 minutes or so. Pretty cool. I love this quirky little phone, perhaps more than I should."
2948,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,"Much like a flip-phone I had many years ago, but with more cool stuff. So, about $20.00 with sim card. I bought this as a backup/secondary device. Charged the device and installed a 32GB  SD card with music. Not a bad music player. (+). Connected to my home wifi (+). Meh camera and video, but at this price point; not terrible.A lot of handy features for $20 flip-phone. Navigation is pretty straightforward given the limited inputs.Online activation did not go well for me. I had to call to activate the phone and get the basic talk/text plan. Then, as a new Tracfone customer I had one heck of a time  creating  an accessible Tracfone account. Still hasn't happened. Talked with John regarding not being able to enter my password multiple times (min. 8 characters). Thanks to Ella and John for trying their best to help me. Phone works well in making calls and texts...and as a music player. I may end up just calling Tracfone to add minutes. Your experience may be different."
2949,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,"does what you need it to do, talk and text. Fairly easy to set up EXCEPT when it come to ""importing"" your contacts from another phone. Can't use Bluetooth or Memory card as I thought would be the case and is mentioned in the instruction booklet. When you have a lot of numbers, adding each one is painstakingly slow and tedious. Other than that, the phone is okay."
2950,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,"As far as cheap phones are concerned where the main goal is cheapness, this one seems pretty good. KaiOS still tries to support a bunch of internet stuff, but I just wanted the cheapest phone I could find so I could set it up without a carrier for a family member to use as a 911-only backup phone.I configured the ""SOS"" button on the front to dial 911 (and it is not at all obvious how to do this because KaiOS configuration is horribly confusing and disorganized) and it just sits around as an emergency backup phone."
2951,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,does not receive texts other than ok
2952,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,"Tracfones have a come a long way and now have features that you would see on an Android phone. But ive NEVER in my life received so many spam calls daily in my life. Its a good backup phone but if this is your primary phone, you will not have a good time"
2953,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,"I ordered this basic flip phone for my 74 year old father. I liked that the phone is affordable and it has bigger buttons. I also like the SOS button on the exterior of the flip phone. I was able to fully customize it to accommodate my father's needs and set it up to be easier to use for him and more user-friendly. It wasn't exactly user-friendly at first until I changed half of the settings on it. The instructions that came with the phone are not that well-written to understand if you aren't good with setting up cellphones, but fortunately I set up my entire family's smartphones and flip phones so I would say that I am an expert at it. This is the third flip phone from tracfone that I have had to set up for my father so I knew what I needed to do regardless of the poor instructions. His 1st flip phone from Tracfone was discontinued, his 2nd flip was a little complicated for him to use well, and this 3rd flip phone is way better than his LG class flip phone. Typing the alphabet on this Alcatel phone is a little complicated (took me 5 minutes to realize it's new typing style) until I went into Settings and changed it to the old typing style of older flip phones. Once you change it to the older typing style, it is easier to setup his contacts and to use text messaging. If you only want to make calls, it is perfect...just type in the number and hit the green button to call or hit to the red button to hang up. I set it up to automatically answer calls when he flips his phone open and hang up when he closes the flip. I like how it tells you on the exterior display of the phone who is calling you. You can change the text to larger text in settings to make it easier to read for the visually impaired. I had to set up his entire contact list which is easier to type his contacts if you mess with the typing/keyboard in Settings first like I already mentioned. It was easy to change the display, volume, brightness, ring tones, and notification tones. You can set it to ""read aloud"" but I disabled it because I found it to be annoying but it may be useful if you are hard of hearing. I like the SOS button on the outside which I programmed it to my phone number. You have to press the SOS button 3 times in order to make the SOS call. You have to press it 4 times if the phone is currently sleeping. The 1st press is to wake the phone up, then hit it 3 times until you see the green dot which means it is calling your emergency contact. I suggest getting your phone set up by someone technologically savvy with phones who can make it as simple as possible for you to use. Overall, I like this flip phone after changing its settings. It is better than the previous 2 flip phones that he owned."
2954,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,"Getting this little TracFone activated is a pain in the wazoo.  I called the number that came with the phone and after jumping through all the hoops and giving them the serial number and Sim card number, was told it didn't go through.  I went online then, and tried doing it that way.  I have spent hours and lots of frustration, and have no idea even yet if it is activated.  Very confusing and upsetting.  There has to be an easier way!Update:  Still have not been able to activate this phone.  Have been online with TracFone again today, and they tell me the serial number that I rec'd with the phone isn't legit.  What the heck?  Sooo, returning the phone to Amazon and will have to figure out an alternative solution...  I'd already bought a ""plan"" for days/minutes from TracFone, so just hope they don't try to use my credit card number to fill that worthless phone...  Not a happy ex-customer--never again!"
2955,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,"This is a very solid, dependable phone.  The battery life is amazing for the price.  I just wish there were more apps, but you get what you pay for."
2956,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,"At less than $20, this phone is a big deal! Works great, easy to use and set up. like NO Brainer..make a call flip it open an dial number...when done close it..also has some smart phone features which are ALSO easy to access. $20 for a 30 day activation and comes with roll over mins if you do a month auto purchase. It's also small an easy to carry. SO why all the crying and blubbering negatives over it from some??? Because of the 20-30 min learning curve?? Or is it the instruction sheet that comes with it which i agree is spartan? However, super easy to find clear user instruction in comments, just take the time to read.  Did I mention the clear sound connections for calls...? just did.  I'm an old guy 76 and even I can figure out how to operate it an thats saying something. So if you like big payments for a big smart phone every month be my guest but if you want to keep some cash in your bank acct then check out this terrific deal of a phone."
2957,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,Still a nice small fone that fits in your sock while riding a bike 10 miles a day
2958,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,"I started my phone history with a TracFone flip. There is definitely a learning curve. For that predictive word query, you can adjust that in settings.Now it's easy for me and I can just move the Sim into a new phone.I find the call quality to be great. I have other smartphones and call quality is bad. I will only use a flip TracFone for calls.The battery is not long lasting. It's weak to start with. You have to be careful opening it. The pictures are pretty low quality. You can Bluetooth them out. The charger is cheap. I toss it and use my own.It can connect to the net but it's no fun on a T9 keyboard. You can put your email on it, just to read updates. You can get messages, but you wouldn't want to send them cause of the keyboard.They also have some cute games in their store. I put a checkers and a sock monster one on mine.I own 5 TracFone flips. For my friend and I. And 3 spare."
2959,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,"I got the phone for less than $20 and for another $20 it is charged for 3 months.  Now, I only use it on local calls and everyone in my contact list are family members.  But that's all I need it for, local calls.  I can't justify paying $40 to $60 a month for a cell phone."
2960,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,"I like the phone.  It has somewhat easy to use call features and lots of sophisticatedprograms to choose from like news, weather, notepad, camera, photo gallery, and typical utilities."
2961,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,This phone cannot used by any SIM card plans so you have to buy a new plan from Tracfone. Overall itâ€™s great choice for elderly people or someone who looking for something simple to use.

2968,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,"Tracfone was able to migrate my 3G LG flip-cellphone to this Alcatel 4G/LTE flip-cellphone. Tracfone patiently received my request for cellphone activation, where they completed the request in a few hours. I only use the flip-cellphone to make calls and receive texts on rare occasions, so I turned-off all other apps on the flip-cellphone to keep from wasting purchased Tracfone ""data"" units for frivolous activities. Also, I created a contact on the flip-cellphone called Customer Service with the cellphone number 611611. Then, I texted 611611 the word Balance to verify my balance and renewal date updated to the new flip-cellphone. In addition, you have an option of storing contacts on the SIM card or on the device and I chose to store them on the device, since I doubt if my 4G SIM card will fit in an upgraded 5G, 6G, etc., cellphone in the future.This Alcatel 4G/LTE cellphone could connect by Wi-FI to my 2.5 Ghz cable modem, but it did not see my 5.0 Ghz cable modem Wi-Fi broadcast. We tested the Alcatel 4G/LTE flip-cellphone and it will automatically switch from using my Wi-Fi cable modem to using 4G/LTE when traveling outside the range of the Wi-Fi cable modem, which is approximately 100 feet. -- I like the Alcatel 4G/LTE cellphone.Enjoy :-)"
2969,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,"The reason for purchase was that T-Mobile informed me they were dropping 3G and my phone would no longer access their Network.  Such phones as they had were expensive, as well as being far more than I required.  After some research I chose Tracphone because this paricular phone is a 4G phone not 5G, and because their plans are very reasonable.  This cellphone can access the Internet, either directly with a router or via the Tracphone Network but my reason fo purchase was simply to be able to make calls outside of the home and to receive texts which are rapidly becoming a second verification to access essential sites.  It takes a bit of work to familiarize with  Thee manuals are either out of date or not a;ways very helpful, but it is worth the effort."

This phone is not good for texting but it can be done. I do not know about the Smart technology that might be in it. I know that it is not tracking me. Just turn the Wifi off and don't set up all of the nonsense. Don't plan on searching the Interwebs with this phone. Make calls, which is what a phone is for. I purchased this for $20.

Under the ""Compare with similar items"" the OS is listed as ""Android"" but it's not like any Android OS I have ever seen; instead when you power up, the phone says it is ""Enabled by KaiOS"", some OS I have never heard of.The interace and user guide were both terrible.  After 3 hours of trying to do basic set up (enter WiFi network, select Bluetooth, etc), I still could not reliably get back to the Settings menu--the little cogwheel was buried deep in the obscure navigation system.All I wanted was a cheap simple phone to make and receive phone calls.  This is not it.  I didn't even try to activate Tracfone, but wonder if that was even possible since the phone did not include a SIM.I am returning the phone as soon as I can figure out the best way to do so with Amazon's closed locker locations and distant UPS drop off sites;  Amazon did not offer a way to return the phone to the Amazon return site in my nearby Whole Foods.Instead of this phone, for only another $32 I bought a very nice Moto G Pure smartphone (locked for Tracfone) at a famous big box store whose name begins with ""W"".

2988,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,"I work night shift and when i go to worm my teenagers are on the phone uptp around 2am yet they have school the following day. Well the phones did not come with sim cards, so i had to go to Walmart and buy the sim cards and airtime. Am yet to put the sim card and will comeback for an update."
2989,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,As with everything else cell providers are increasing prices which sucks because weâ€™re already tight on economic issues.These phones are simple to use as you pay only for the time you use.Definitely recommend buying a couple if youâ€™re tired of having a computer in your pocket all the time.
2990,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,No Directions what so ever on How To Turn The phone On!  It's the RED BUTTON ...Ok Button Or Green Button where what I would have THOUGHT should be used.. red was my LAST CHOICE !  It's a LEARN as You Go
2991,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,"Great price for a 4G phone but surprised there is no voicemail. WIFI a little sketchy but works. Nice alternative to a Smartphone.Update: I have a 2018 Toyota Highlander and have tried to connect to phone with Bluetooth. I works for a while and then cause my radio to go into a shutdown loop. What I means is the radio will come on initialize and then shut off and just keeps doing it.. Once I disconnect the phone, the radio stops the shutting down. I believe it is using a different Bluetooth protocol."
2992,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,This flip phone comes with numerous application icons on the Home screen that will confuse the elderly and they cannot be removed.  This has led to untold frustration with my elderly mother who needs things as simple as possible.  She keeps accidentally pressing the icons and that takes her into applications where she gets totally lost and can't use the phone.  I called Tracfone and their support team confirmed they cannot be removed.
2993,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,"I like a flip phone because it is small enough to fit inside my front pocket. This phone has the features I need and takes good pictures  too but I wish I could download them to my comp. All in all this phone is the best value for me, ( $20.00 bucks vs $600.00 for a "" smart"" phone?"
2994,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,Ordered for my elderly mother who only uses a flip phone. Easy to set up as all trac fones are. Packaged nicely and everything was good.
2995,TracFone,My Flip 2,4 GB,Android,2.8 Inches,this phone way too complicated for 2 83 year olds-  dealing with trac fone on the phone a disaster as has been the case in the past-  cant understand their sales reps half the time-  too many features we will never use-  bought a jitter bug flip 2 and what a difference-  good bye trac fone

2997,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"This phone is like a well-designed pocket knife.. it has many tools and all of them are easily accessible and execute well.. the phone is incredibly fast and smooth.. something that my V60 was getting harder at day in and day out... When Amazon listed this device at 549, I ran out of excuses not to pick it up...The cameras on the phone are more than adequate and I consider myself a fairly competent photographer.. 4K and 8K video is stunning... Battery charging is insanely fast.. better than anything I've ever seen before obviously.. 15 minutes at an airport kiosk will get you up to speed with the supplied 65 watt charger.. just make sure you use the cable that comes with it.. some skinny little cheese cable from the 99 cent store is not going to cut it..The phone is also just the right size.. much lighter and smaller than my v60.. it's a wolf in sheep's clothing and the price is great!You're definitely going to want to purchase a phone case and screen protector.. remember to redo your fingerprint scan or not even set it up until after you get the screen protector on.. many have complained about the fingerprint reader AFTER they have applied a screen protector.. that's not the phone's fault... Just delete the old fingerprint and rescan it with the screen protector in place! It's not that hard"
2998,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,I bought the one plus 9 pro and returned it because it had terrible signal and terrible Bluetooth. This 10 pro has zero issues for me. I can be down in the lower level at work and through block walls. I still have signal. The battery life is amazing. And the fast charger gets me to full in 15 minutes. It's amazing. I am a long time gooe phone user from every nexus to every pixel. My last phone was a pixel xl 3. I loved it until I started having service issue.  I may never return to pixel now that I have experienced the one plus. You won't be disappointed. Being able to get a 10 pro at 500 is amazing.
2999,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,Tiene problemas no llega la actualizaciÃ³n de Android 13 u es problema de los 10 pro que no se puede actualizar ğŸ˜¡
3000,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"It's just like any other one plus phones but better. If you have used one plus phones before. You'll know.Clean os, awesome display, fast operations, one of the fasted charging options out there. Just 2nd to 10T version. Over all a great Android phone experience."
3001,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"Honestly, I was prepared to be disappointed based on how much bad light OnePlus has received lately. But I loved my 9 Pro and just wished it had a more competitive camera and battery life. The 10 Pro is a solid improvement worth trying despite sacrificing RAM and storage. I managed to move ~50GB to the cloud and am okay with the change, now I can fit plenty within the 128GB given. The RAM decrease has had no noticeable effect on me at all yet.The SuperVOOC charging is neat, but not really that impressive compared to the 9 Pro. I was already happy with that speed, and this does shorten the time a bit more, but the real winner here is the 50w wireless charging. I haven't bought a corresponding charger yet, but due to the speed improvement I definitely will be. On that note, the battery size increase is also felt, and much appreciated. I feel confident in going a full day without needing to charge until at least bedtime - usually the 9 Pro needed a boost sometime around the early evening. The fast charging really cancels out the inconveniences of a smaller battery, though. You can't really complain much if you can give it more than enough power for the rest of your night within a few minutes.I went with Volcanic Black despite my 9 Pro being green, but I got a much better deal on the price by doing so. The build quality, in my opinion, is also a slight improvement over the 9 Pro. The all-black looks sleek with the shiny metal frame and matte back. The black glass is also just really addicting to look and and feel. The pictures make it look a bit sandpaper-ish but it's very, very smooth.I don't use my camera near as much I used to, but when I do I can still get picky over my picture quality and the 9 Pro left me wanting a bit more most of the time. The colors and sharpness on the 10 Pro are noticeably better than the 9 and I feel it was a worthwhile upgrade for this alone. I'd post some comparison shots if I hadn't already sold my old phone.All in all, I do wish OnePlus would give us back a 256GB model, or a microSD slot, and having the RAM in case we do need it eventually would be cool, but I understand the chip shortage affects everyone. I was really trying to wait until they brought a 256GB model to the US, but no idea if that's happening, so I thought I'd go ahead and try this out. Glad I did!EDIT: I have happily replaced my 128GB model with a 256GB now that OnePlus has released those in the US. Still just as happy with this phone as day 1."
3002,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"I am very pleased with my OnePlus 10 Pro.  I was originally trying to decide between it vs a flagship Pixel or iPhone.  I listed out the pros and cons of each.  I was concerned about the Pixel's modem/connectivity issues.  I was concerned about paying a premium to Apple to be part of their proprietary world.  The OnePlus is everything I could ask for.  It is a real powerhouse.  It did take me a bit of effort to customize it to my personal tastes, but now it is exactly the way I prefer.  The battery life and camera, though not quite as good as those of the iPhone Pro Max, are nevertheless outstanding and more than adequate for my needs."
3003,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"I've owned the phone for a few months now. Here is my honest review. Battery is a all day battery, I have no problems answering phone calls and texting all day and even watching TikTok and browsing social media. The camera itself is really nice, however the camera tends to get blurry the farther you zoom in to take photos which I understand it doesn't have a long range camera which is OK. The selfie camera in front of the unit is awesome, not many phones have great selfie cameras and it's actually surprising. Now for people claiming it comes with color OS. It does not. It comes with Oxygen OS 12 (Android 12), Color OS is only non US Models. Now I'm a T-Mobile customer, I know TMobile has MMWave Technology, and this phone does not have it. The one thing that really makes up for that is that it can do 5G Support or 4G LTE Support, now 90% of areas I'm in have the 5g support down here in South West Florida. When I'm in towns or busy business areas, doing speed tests on the T-Mobile network, I've gotten between 40 Mbps download to 700 Mbps in select areas and 30 upload to 80 upload which is more then enough and even faster then Xfinity internet...... That I'm paying for in my house..... Honestly going from 4G Support to 5G support on the T-Mobile network really shocked me in coverage and speeds. This phone does support lots of 5g bands and even 4g bands. Now besides network connectivity, battery and the camera this is one solid phone. I came from a Samsung S10+. Now before buying this phone I got the pleasure to play around with the S22 and the One Plus 10 Pro, depending on the deals going on value per dollar will vary. I ended up going with the One Plus 10 Pro since the price, the battery is comparable to the S22 Ultra and is a solid phone. I will give it 4.5 stars due to the zoom features being alittle lack luster. Everything else is solid on the phone. Please note that the One Plus 10 Pro US Model only has one sim card slot, and only supports 65 Watts. At the time of purchase it said 85 watts which is not true. Only the non US Model at this time has 85 Watts and dual sim capabilities.A newer one plus 10 is coming out featuring more ram and more storage so keep an eye out for that too. It may also have more features."
3004,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"Nice smooth screen. VERY fast battery charging. Decent performance. Good cameras, except for the wide angle that got a downgrade from the previous version.Even after adjusting the screen settings to reduce power, it still runs down a bit faster than expected. Bluetooth connectivity is a bit spotty, as every now and then it cuts out from devices that are consistent performers on my Samsung, and laptop. I would say Bluetooth performance and slightly lower than expected volume settings (Samsung and LG are oddly louder) the biggest issues for me. The amount of RAM is good (8GB), but not up to newer standards (12GB)... which shouldn't matter, but oddly I've found some apps are closed aggressively. Maybe the power and the apps closing quickly are issues with the software optimization that Samsung figured out, as my S10e seems to do a better job of reducing background activity from apps that I don't often use. In fact the 10 Pro keeps bugging me about my anti-virus which needs to run unhindered in the background, but it ignores the settings to leave it alone.Overall, a good phone with some really good features. I believe a few software tweaks to handling background usage could probably extend battery use seamlessly, but even without it is still a great performer. Maybe adding in expandable storage, or e-sim, or something a little more would make this a GREAT phone."
3005,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,I have been using this line of OnePlus phones for 7 years ... excellent products !!!!
3006,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"This phone only works on T-Mobile. Wasn't happy that I had to switch but worked just fine afterwards.Super fast, great features. Battery life is excellent compared to my previous device. Screen is awesome. Haven't had a chance to really try the cameras but I'm expecting good things.4/5 only since I haven't gotten a true feel for it yet."

3010,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"I'm a few weeks into my 10 pro ownership, after breaking my 9 pro.In spite of people looking for problems and critiques of Oneplus, this phone continues to be rock solid and reliable.I have 0 regrets and would definitely recommend this to anyone."
3011,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"Good phone but nothing special, the OnePlus 7pro felt like a world above other phones at the price range it was at while the OnePlus 10 pro it just feels like anyother phone. Cameras average, battery life is average, resolution is average, compared to other phones in it's price range while phone speed and charging speed are both quite good."
3012,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"I liked the performance of the phone. Connectivity is solid without any issues. Awesome battery life, i sometime get done with 2 days of use without charging as I am not a heavy phone user.Fast Charging is awesome as well. There is nothing bad in the phone. Since I switched from pixel to oneplus perhaps the camera is not it's strongest point. But it's pretty close and is good enough for my day to day use. Highly recommend the phone"

3014,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,Product did not live upto expectations. Wasted over $900 as it is unusable in Colombia. How can I get my refund? It was purchased in June 2022
3015,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,Coming from a long time on and off OnePlus user there is now better value on the market. OnePlus used to have really high end specs for their never settle price. Now they have pretty much the same specs as most flagships at the same price. After trying some other devices I feel you can save a few hundred dollars elsewhere and get almost the same thing.
3016,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,My favorite I like about this phone is the fact that it has the rapid charging. I had the Flagship Pixel phone and it was horrible. I love the color and the camera.

3018,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"Surprisingly phone hanged in 1st hour, but no complaint till now. Its good bit inwas expecting more from OnePlus with this launch.Quality and price are not justifiable."
3019,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"Fast, powerful, minimal bloatware, really good cameras, 65 watt quick charger is great. Flashlight could be brighter is my only complaint after 2 months. Love the Vibrate/Sound slider button, easy to quickly change without waking the phone."
3020,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"This page explicitly advertises the OnePlus 10 Pro model NE2215 USA.After opening the package and checking the serial number, I realized that the phone I was shipped was instead model NE2210. The two models look and feel the same, except the NE2210 does not work with ATT, does not support all the US bands, and the software it runs is different! Make sure to check the serial number before using the phone."
3021,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"Love the size of the device as well as the beautiful screen and 120hz refresh rate. The amazing battery life and speakers are another plus. Itâ€™s not too heavy even though it has a 5,000 mAh cell. Itâ€™s a nice upgrade from my 7 Pro."
3022,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,El telÃ©fono tiene muy buena memoria. Trabaja muy rÃ¡pido el procesador.  Me encanta.
3023,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,The one plus line is amazing. Very underrated phones.
3024,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,My only must have is long battery life and sadly no phone I have ever had has fit the need.  That being said it's camera quality and ease of use are exceptional!
3025,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"Has been waiting for it's release and hands on right away. The screen is big with high resolution. Display is vivid and beautiful. System is smooth and fast with new OS. There is no delay opening apps and gaming experience is satisfying. Camera is upgraded and I enjoy taking pictures very much. Overall, this is a solid masterpiece and you will not regret."
3026,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"The camara quality is superior to all my previous cell phones. The quality of the picturea, and the easy to switch between modes and videos is simply amazing."
3027,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"I know that it has less ram and less memory, but it has an awesome optimization of resources. PLUS there are phones that are 18gb ram, and they don't use even a third of it. Same with this, you won't ever use those 8gb... And 128gb is more than enough, everything is in the cloud nowadays!"

3029,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"Love the sleek design and color. I get a lot of complements bc no one recognizes this phone. Stove top camera design is really eye-catching. Clean UI, and all the great features you'd expect from a big name flagship."
3030,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"I have only had this phone for 1 hr.  Just arrived. Upon opening the box, I discovered that there is no case and no sim ejector.  Watched an unboxing video last night and there was a case in the video. Transferred all of my data and the phone is blazing hot to the touch.  I let it set for about 30 minutes after the transfer and it is still very hot.  I am not sitting outside or in my car, I am in the house with AC on and its burning up.  Siiiiigh...I want to remain a OnePlus fan but this has broken my heart.  I leave for a trip in 5 days and desperately need another phone.  I am tempted to just get a Samsung from Tmobile"
3031,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"I want to start off and say I loved my 8 pro it was such a great phone that I recommend my friend get the 9 pro. But, sadly the 10 pro feels like buggy garbage the screen orientation is off with images on most sites and HDMI to USB+c will freeze your phone until you do a reboot. Oneplus used to be amazing at the price it was but, sadly I'm going to recommend the pixel for the price conscious."
3032,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"*Edit at bottom*I got my device before the release date! Super excited. This is definitely the best one yet, SOOOOOOOO FAST!!! The camera is amazing, crisp clear vibrant images. It even came with a nice screen protective film pre-installed (THANK YOU!). I have never see a phone charge this fast in my life. Came with a feature to transfer all my old device data via the charging cable, very nice touch. Literally everything about this device is just awesome. I definitely recommend getting the Pro version, the 12GB of RAM is just incredible. Coming from the OnePlus 6T and this really a very nice upgrade. Thank you OnePlus! You've outdone yourselves once again!*Edit* This phone software is very buggy, the VPN shows active and still leaks internet traffic, certain apps don't even launch. I am beyond disappointed. Will be returning. I used to be the biggest OnePlus fan before this device."
3033,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"The phone came with 0% battery. Charged it for 10 hours only to get 81%. Ask Amazon for a replacement and they said to get a refund instead, because most of the customers are returning it for one issue or another."

Broke the back glass one week and the week after that it stopped charging and won't turn on. Their support process is a nightmare. The last 3 phones from one plus have been an utter disappointment. After 2 months a bought a pixel 6 pro, and I'm still waiting on the repair return label for my one plus."
3044,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,"It's getting hard to buy OnePlus, prices are going up and customer service going down. Bought the phone, next day a promotion was available giving a free watch, asked to get the watch and they just denied, doesn't seen fair at all. The device itself is overpriced and delivers less memory and storage than my old one, still works well but this is something that made me think many times before deciding to buy, doesn't make sense to get a new flagship with workt specs than older models."
3045,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,The phone works but when I got it it was broken it had horrible signal and it just didn't work that well don't buy it save your money
3046,OnePlus,OP 10 Pro,8 GB,Android 12,6.7 Inches,Buggy overall. Double-tap to wake inconsistent. Switching between apps erratic. I am currently running its latest update and have owned this device for 6 months. These annoying issues have not been fixed.
3047,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"I broke my Samsung while visiting NYC and bought this one as a temporary substitute but I fell in love with its battery life. The camera is amazing for cell phone photography. It is very easy to use and responds promptly. The only problem I had with it was when I returned to Turkey and tried to install a Turk Telekom SIM into it. The phone didn't respond to that. I wonder if it works outside the U.S. If not, my money is wasted because I do not live in the U.S. I took a star out for that :("
3048,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"I just got the phone a couple of days ago but have been using it constantly and putting it to the test a lot in the last 48 hours.  It feels really nice in the hand and has a fairly premium feel to it despite it being very budget friendly.  Love the large screen.  The facial recognition and fingerprint sensor are perfect... they both work really well and i have not had any trouble with either one.  It's got android 12 which is cool and fun to use.  I love that you can take a picture using the fingerprint sensor... excellent idea and makes it so much easier than having to worm your thumb around to hit the button on the screen .. esp. with a large phone like this.  Lots of little extras that you can discover if you spend some time playing around with it. The downside is that it is a bit on the slow side.  It definitely does lag when opening apps .. some apps take longer than others.  Scrolling thru Twitter and Instagram is bumpy at best.  Other applications on the phone like settings, contacts, email, messages, etc, seem to scroll just fine.  But not a super quick phone if that is what you are looking for.  That said, you can get used to pretty much anything and for the money this is a pretty solid device.  I've had two other TCL phones and liked them both very much.  This one is my favorite size-wise, but the other two models had faster processors.  Screen colors are pretty nice.  Photos aren't bad.  The camera seems improved over the TCL 20s which is the other model i own.  Not a point and shoot camera - you have to take at least a couple of shots to get it perfectly clear and focused, in my experience.  All in all fairly pleased with it.  Early days so time will tell but as of right now it's not bad.  Battery life is great.  With moderate use you will definitely get a full day and then some."
3049,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"The phone I was using prior to this one was slowing down a bit and also the battery life seems to be draining faster, as well as charging slower. I bought this phone thinking I'd be getting a bit of an upgrade, but it's not a great phone, honestly. The speakers are awful and the processor is the worst - my two main qualms. Otherwise, it pretty much functions like any other phone. I've been debating just switching my service back to my old phone but then I wouldn't know what to do with this one since I can no longer return it. I mostly bought it because it was slightly bigger than my previous phone but honesty... There's hardly a difference. Major pass on this product.Update: TCL Direct-US reached out and sent me a very kind response per the review I've left stating my disappointment. They offered to provide a full refund for my purchase. I have been using this phone still during this time and I'd say that it's still a functional phone despite my opinion on specifics. I am comparing it to a phone I used to use prior to this one which I found to be comparable, whilst looking for an upgrade without breaking the bank. This phone may not have been what I was looking for, but it could very well be what you are looking for. I think many people would be satisfied with purchasing this phone. Regardless, I find TCL's customer service to be excellent, attentive, and friendly and I am happy with my experience in the end."

3051,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Cons,The screen is not pure inky black and has poor side viewing.The cameras are not world class.Feels sluggish at times.You need high sensitivity, low impedance headphones to get the most out of the 3.5mm headphone jackPROsThe screen gets BRIGHT, and when looking at the phone head on, it is vivid and clearThe camera app is intuitive, easy to use, and pro mode is a bunch of fun... for me anyway!after 3-4 hours of updates, disabling\removing bloatware and unwanted programs, the phone feels responsive and I'm able to play hill climb racing 2 without any hiccups.As a phone goes, everyone says my voice is clear, not much low end in the ear speaker from the other person, but it goes loud and it is clear, same goes for the stereo speakers at the bottom, speakerphone works well, there is no time warp delay, or hearing yourself when you call.I believe I have actually upgraded my phone, as a phone. My note 20 ultra 5g SUCKED as a phone constantly dropping calls.This phone feels premium in the had and the cameras are protected by the thinnest of phone cases. the clear included case works perfectly fine!______________________________________________________________________________I am very happy with it, overall.10/10 FOR PRICE/PERFORMANCEwould recommend this phone to anyone who does not care if things are INSTANT. I think they used SLOW lpddr, paired with slow mmlc 64GB creating a unique bandwidth problem. The pages scroll much better after things are loaded. (I'm using the phone for texting, conference, and yep, phone calls all are instant with no lag whatsoever, same with home-screen/phone/settings navigation all really smooth)"
3052,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"I had recently bought a new car(Subaru Crosstrek) and I bought this for the primary purpose of using it with Android Auto since my older phone was so spotty with mobile data that it could not keep a constant connection during my trips.My early impressions have been mostly positive with this phone. The phone feels premium in the hand with a nice, large screen and every function that I have tried so far has worked smoothly.Battery life is better than my previous phone but isn't as good as I had expected during actual usage(after about half a day of moderate-heavy usage the battery is already down to about 40%).Overall though I am very pleased with this phone as it operates smoothly and feels nice in the hand but most importantly it works without a hitch with Android Auto."
3053,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"PROS: Fast, 6MB RAM, good battery life, decent display, fingerprint and face recognition, good camera and camera options (50mp and macro options), add'l storage option, earjack plugin, case included, pretty easy setup, great price.CONS: No 5G or some financial app functions, but I don't need it and it's not really that available in many places. Slightly larger than expected, but pretty ergonomic, so no biggie. Telephoto not available in 50mp mode, a minor disappointment.I bought for $151, outstanding camera for the price!"
3054,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,Decent budget phone had a mind of is own like putting itself into braille mode and took a few hours to get it back to normal and the touch screen defenetly had issue more times then not
3055,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Arrived in undamaged box, but screen has damage right from the fact.Purchased new, not refurbished, should not have been sent a detective phone.Did activate it because I needed a phone, and still do!Also, phone reboots randomly and rejects updates.  Phone updated, all updates appeared on screen, but when I reboot the phone, it reverted to original configuration without being reset.Screen damage not caused by me or by abuse. Display is really nice and phone processes quickly, but cannot get around receiving what appears to be a refurb, when I bought direct from Amazon as a full price new phone.Returning for credit, will likely buy a different brand...one with hardened glass screen.I never thought that a manufacturer like TCL would hide the fact the screen is plastic, and flimsy enough that something in the box tapped the screen during shipping (charger?) only to expose that the screen is not hardened glass.The reboot loss of updates issue effects functionality."
3056,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"It's everything that I was looking for. My 6 year old lost his phone and it was time to visit Dad so I purchased the he TCL. It works great for him. He can play games, watch Netflix and call me.I noticed that it runs a little slower than I'd like but for the price who's fussing.It was a great buy for us."
3057,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"I picked this up for Google Fi because I didn't want to spend 500 to 800 dollars on a phone that was only a bit better. This was a fantastic choice. The camera is infinitely better than a phone I got from Motorola for 200 dollars. It runs awesome, the screen looks great, it sounds good. All in all I really like it and hope that it continues to work for me for years to come."
3058,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,You can tell it's not a Samsung the ui is not as fluid perfect for me cuz I don't need to spend big money on phone you will need to restart this phone every couple days I've had for 2 months and it works well I had Samsung a21 from bout 4 years before and it's bout as good as that but in newer model can't find anything this good for less than 300 to 500 in my opinion I'm happy I activated through straight talk if want know how it pretty simple
3059,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Got it for my mom. Almost better than my iPhone. Huge screen with great resolution and colors. Not 5G capable but a great phone that can do as much and even more than my iPhone albeit more slowly because the processor seems weaker. Still, if you get this phone you will be quite impressed for the cost."
3060,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Had to do a return. First phone that I got has a bad memory and I had to do a hard restore to get it to work, and then continued to have issues. Lost some photos that were not backed up.  The replacement phone has had no issues and is working as expected.  Camera is good, could be a little better for nightime shots.  Good size and good speed for good enough (lower powered) graphic games.  Bright and clear display. Audio is good for the price. Used a TMobile reseller for minimal anual amount and should be good for emergency uses and or when primary phone battery dies."
3061,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Don't do it.EDIT 7-14-22:  this afternoon TCL/Amazon combined the 20se with the 30xl page so that suddenly it looks like this unimpressive, laggy, newly released 30XL (with 13 reviews, mainly negative) somehow shot up to 2658 positive reviews in one day. Seems a bit underhanded, doesn't it? Let these actions guide your decision to purchase from this company that wants your data.  END EDITDon't do it.I know the price is tempting. There may even be a 15% off coupon. But this is a really bad choice for a phone. Even setting aside their privacy policy - FWIW the first time that I ever read one that I instinctively thought was more intrusive than Google. Go look it up. They monitor EVERYTHING -the phone itself isn't impressive for too long after you press the power button.I ordered this because my old Moto G from 2020 can't keep the charging cable attached any longer.  I'm a thrifty guy who still enjoys tech, and I thought I'd found a hidden gem in the TCL. The price was right and it was a modern phone from a reputable manufacturer, and overseas reviews were fairly positive, so I thought I'd give it a try.When the 30XL arrived I was excited, and I thought I'd stick with it even after being disturbed by the privacy policy since I needed a new phone immediately. Be sure to read it, though. Wow.I got everything loaded up and... Wait, is something wrong?  Why is this brand new phone slower than my two or three year old $180 Moto G? Maybe it's updating. No, it's just slow. Wow, it's REALLY slow. You'll see if you order one. It lags from the start.Sure enough, I looked up a comparison of the processor in this 30XL (Helio G25) to the outdated but decent snapdragon 655 in my cheapo Moto G, and this 2-years newer phone is humiliated by the old Motorola.TCL? That's not how this is supposed to work, guys.Well, at least the display is better. Oh, wait. Never mind. It's a 720 display. Huh. So it's slower than the old Moto G I'm replacing, and the display looks worse, AND it's already lagging before I've even loaded any programs on it. And all for $200.I sent it back. This is unacceptable, even at this price point, and consumers should reject this silliness lest manufacturers believe it should become their standard for quality.Avoid if it costs more than $100 or so. You'll be disappointed if you've ever had another phone. You've been warned. You're probably better off finding a used Galaxy S10 or 2nd generation IPhone SE or something else in this price range but still capable of adequately performing routine tasks.Again, avoid.EDIT: I don't get anything for free for being a ""top reviewer in men's gloves size L"" or anything like that, but please click the helpful button if you found this helpful so we can get this to the top and save everyone a bunch of time and money. I can't imagine the hours and gas wasted by tens of thousands of people like me who think they've found their Moto G Power replacement but who will end up returning it. Thanks."
3062,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,10/21/22 Update: So far so good.  No other issues and increase to 4 stars.WAS:Reasonable low-cost phone.  Got it working with H2O Wireless reasonably fast! But disappointed there is no WiFi calling.  My older Redmi 6 pro had this function. Device to device requires a USB cable should be documented.  I have to start fresh.
3063,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"For the price of the phone I was stoked for what I was getting out the box.. big screen, big battery, decent stereo sound from the speakers, but what I soon found out was that the battery wasn't quite working with this phone. I reached out to TCL and explained my issue and they immediately sent me out a replacement phone to make things right. When I received the new phone I checked again to make sure all was working correctly and it wasn't. Frustrated and wondering what was going on I reached out to TCL yet again and explained to them that not one but both phones were no good. TCL was super helpful and friendly with their customer service that a manger was spoken to about my problems and a solution was brought to my attention. They upgraded me from the 30 XL to the 20 Pro 5G phone free of charge for the inconveniences I may have encountered. I was truly grateful for this offer and they were super nice about the whole ordeal. Although the 30 XL wasn't working right the fact that TCL not only sent me a second replacement phone but to upgrade me to another phone without hesitation shows how much they care for their customers. So one bad phone doesn't make this a bad company. I'm now happy with my phone and happy with their customer service."
3064,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,So far I have only used the finger print and number code. I haven't used the face recognition yet. The battery life seems to be very good. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't have a call screening feature that I had on my previous cellphone. Maybe they'll look into that. I am happy with everything else.
3065,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"I absolutely love the battery life. It is an all day device absolutely. The thing I do find strange however Is that very little info exists about this model and it looks just like the tcl 30 SE. But had its own unique packaging. Just a weird  qualm I had with it. Also I couldn't find it listed anywhere, could the seller list weather this is a 32 or 64 bit phone. Absolutely worth the price on sale."
3066,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"At first I was apprehensive about the whole phone, took a lil bit to set up the first time but after that, itâ€™s smooth sailing, super user friendly great camera software easy to edit pics,love the screen size fits in pockets very well.I was impressed by the battery my prev droid killed my battery while using Netflix, easy to get use to many options for security with or without face recognition or thumb print."

3071,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,I'm very pleased with this phone. I upgraded from a previous Android version and I'm glad that I did. Would recommend this to anyone and the price is very easy to live with.
3072,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"this is the phone if one is almost out of a coverage area, while the Cubot X30, Redmi 11 pro, Umidigi A13 pro, A9 pro pulled in my location below 1Mb/sec on mobile data, the TCL went up to 20 Mb/sec !!! also the reception on bluetooth and Wifi is outstanding, what is missing is the 2nd mic for video in stereo, it has 2 speakers but only one mic!!!!, the camera is very good, actually better even than the Redmi 11 Pro with 108 Mpix, The only negative is that it says charger incompatible even with the charger which came with it, but it still charges"
3073,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,What I like: It's a big phone. The finger print sensor works well and it's in the rear. Mine came with a gel case.What I don't like: The Bluetooth doesn't always connect. The Auto light sensor can't seem to make up its mind weather to adjust to the right brightness or not. You can't turn of Google sync. There's no light up dot to let you know there's a message when the screen is locked. Some bloatware you can't uninstall. Very glitchy at times and slow. The TCL 20S is a better phone. Consider buying that before this one.
3074,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,Phone is a little big for my small hands. So far so good no complaints.
3075,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,I reordered and had to pay shipping. It corrupted itself. I reset and it never worked well after. So this is second time around. It's a nice phone. Takes beautiful pics. The size is good for me and light enough. I have arthritis. So if any problems arise again. I will right a new review.
3076,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"I used up 20GB right away from updates, but 40GB is a good amount. The screen size is awesome. The RAM speeds make it really fast and smooth when navigating through things. The only stutters were when I was installing and downloading updates while swiping through a webpage.Only downside is that there aren't that many ""Heavy-duty"" cases for this phone (It's the equivalent of a TCL 20se. The 20se has an extra button on the left side, and the 30XL does not. The case would still fit for the right side power and volume buttons.) A heavy duty case is important because it is essentially a cheaper substitute for a warranty.I bought the phone anyway, and I am pleased so far. I will be putting a 12 month Mint service sim in it because Mint is GSM."

Now have it hooked to a MVNO after 1st failed because of complexity (NOT my fault). Phone deserves a good rating now. Large screen, Android up to date and good. With two weeks using it, the only things that reduce it froma five star to a four is speakers/sound. My OPINION on this phone---worth buying."

My eyes have not hurt since I purchased and used my tcl 30xl and I absolutely love it and picked it up at the 151.99 and is worth every penny and has given me lots of gaming surfing the internet enjoyment. This is a very snappy phone I keep all my pics screen shots in the cloud so I don't keep things on my phone.this phone has been a real surprise at how fast and smooth it is to me.

3088,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"TL is making an amazing set of phones for really good breakthrough prices.  I happened upon the brand when seardhing separately for inexpenive phones with great battery life.  My iphone hand-me-down from my wife, a 7plus, really was poor on battery life and it drove me crazy, which is why I sought something with really good battery life.  In practice, however, thie 30XL battery life, which pretty good, was not as good as advertised.  The battery life, however, generally did fit my needs for sure.  My problems with the phone are several.  I was not able to enable WiFi calling, and now I find that a number of the TCL phones to not permit WiFi calling except with certain carriers.  Bummer.  There were many features I really liked but one problem I couldn't live with.  When texting I had to take extreme care to not hit the lower margin of the space bar or the punctuation boxes.  If I was a bit low it took me completely out of the text screen to one of several others and I had to then search again for the text function and go back and find where I had been.  I found this intolerable and it may well be that somehow it can be overcome with an internal OS adjustment.  I don't have the time or energy to go through all of that, so I was within the return window and I did return it.  Today I ordered the TCL 10L, which appears to have wonderful features and is an upgrade from the 30XL.  I would very much like the 20Pro but didn't want the 300 price tag.  Ii got the bundle with the ear buds so we'll see how all that works.  Sincerely hope this helps someone."
3089,TCL,TCL 30XL NIGHT MIST,64 GB,Android 12.0,6.82 Inches,"Actually is a very good phone. I really havent found a downside to it. If youre looking for a very up to date phone, with alot of the newest features, but at a lower cost, this phone is it. I suppose if i had to dig for a fault it would be that its hard to find info about this phone online. Almost like it never existed"

I can't turn off the voicemail notifications all they are is advertising and I can't turn off the voicemail notifications. I want my voicemail I do not want the notifications Android has not been my favorite phone. If I keep finding new features that I can't disable when I want to my reading on it will probably drop.

I wasnt expecting much. Its got a gig of RAM and 16 gb of storage. It's compatible with TextNow and that's what I needed. Battery life is solid. Performance isnt the best but again, this isnt my Samsung Galaxy and I expected that. The camera isnt good either, except for posting pictures of goods to sell online for stuff like Amazon or Ebay.

3105,Alcatel,Alcatel 1,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,"I am a connoisseur of cheap, unlocked cell phones. It has been years since I have had a phone plan tethered to a specific device. I say this upfront to make clear to everyone reading that I know what a good cheap phone looks like, feels like, how it operates. This is not a good cheap phone.  I have used the cheap versions of Nokia, Motorola, and Blu to varying degrees of satisfaction in the past, and, depending on your budget, would recommend each of those brands to this one.What is specifically wrong with this device? For one, it is sensitive and slow. These two defects go together frequently. You will make a phone call, your ear will hit an app on the screen, and you will be moments away from accidentally ordering an Uber to your location. Or you will call up Google Maps, it will take eons to load, and you will accidentally hit the wrong location on the sensitive screen, which will take another few eons to clear away to restart your search proper.I have more bad things to say about this phone, but I will not belabor the point. For cheapest of the cheap, Blu is better. If you can scrounge a bit more money together, the unlocked Nokias and Motorolas are better. I cannot speak to any other brand, but I would guess they are all better than the Alcatel. Do not purchase unless you want constant headaches.Update (October 2022): After five months of struggling with this phone, I have finally called it quits and ordered a different unlocked brand. It became impossible to have phone conversations of any length, because the oversensitive touch screen would start activating all of the apps while on your call, start recording the call, turn down the volume, or, in one frustrating but hilarious instance, all of these things at once.I downgraded this phone from ""2 stars"" to ""1 star."" It is just not worth it. Any other brand is better."
3106,Alcatel,Alcatel 1,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,"At first blush and high ratings, it seemed OK.  On day 30 the battery would not charge so I did what most ordinary customers do... tried another charging cable that I knew worked and another charging source I also knew it to be operable.  Alas, it did not charge.  So I called Amazon Customer Service (you know the new customer-centric service!!!)n they would not budge.  THE POLICY IS 30 DAYS UPON RECEIPT....NOT WHEN IT IS SHIPPED 30 DAYS.  i AM AN OLD 72yrs and disabled with all the carnage of 3 Purple Hearts, 2 Navy Cross's and The Medal of Honor presented to me by the President of the Republic of S. Vietnam and a host of others besides being captured by the Khmer Rough.  I do not lie nor attempt to get something for nothing... it is simply an oath I learned at the Naval Academy.I was treated like a wounded dog.  Amazon said they would not honor my request due to their policy of sticking to 30 day product warranty policy.  So now I have to buy the 3rd phone within a year and buy the 2 year warranty for another $14 on a cheap phone.  Go figure.  Yep, sure feels like Customer-centric service.  I have a limited budget and am tired of it all so we can buy more Chinese stuff.  Finally, after an hour with this clown and sorry excuse for customer service, I finally asked for a 2-tier up manager who had to read the entire thread from the beginning.  My hands are totally numb and I suffer from Associative Disorder which causes me to look at one key and type another (too many concussions).  The guy even questioned the spelling of my words!!  I think he thought he could wear me out like a dishcloth.  Nope, didn't happen.  After a very long hour, the manager finally gave me my money back.  I really was uncomfortable and asked for an apology for treating a disabled Vet with such disrespect and disdain for the elderly.  A major fubar and a sad day for Amazon.  Shame shame shame.  Disgusting corporate customer-centrics for my money and they did not apologize.  Lt. Commander, U.S.N.  name witheld"
3107,Alcatel,Alcatel 1,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,This phone is not horrible but itâ€™s not good either itâ€™s not for elderly people so if your looking for a cell for an older person this is not it!
3108,Alcatel,Alcatel 1,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,"The battery would only last a bit over 4 hours. It didn't have good reception, but then again, it was a very inexpensive phone."

3111,Alcatel,Alcatel 1,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,"I'm using this phone while AT&T replaces my phone which was rendered inoperative with the latest %G system upgrade.  I bought a Mint Mobile at Best Buy but it was incompatible with the phone. I got lucky, however, because the burner phone accepted my old sim card and can make calls since they are not on AT&T.The guy who sold me the sim card said my dual sim card Alitel One (burner phone) was a foreign phone and might not be compatible with some sim cards.Well, it works with AT&T.I was easily able to port my data from one Android phone to another."
3112,Alcatel,Alcatel 1,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,"Just popped in my Tmobile SIM card from the iphone I dropped and worked perfectly!  Love blue background and tactile feel of backbody - quality appearance and excellent pocket-fitting size.  Surprisingly good YouTube video music sound - esp. with headphones.  I need to fix Android GO to stop over-correcting my text, though onscreen keyboard works well.  Install visual voice mail for Tmobile.  Nothing else really needed.  Easy options. Serves my basic needs. Battery life seems better, though drained faster the first day.  I keep it plugged in overnight. Auto screen shutoff after 1 minute. At first, or if completely power down - which I don't do much, the alcatel enjoy.life load logo will drive you nuts waiting for it to warm up - so use sparingly."

3127,Alcatel,Alcatel 1,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,The battery doesn't last long like newer cellphones that come with the lithium battery and texting on it is hard at times the keypad is so small that the spacebar and the menu button are close to each other that sometimes when texting I accidentally hit the menu button. Other than that it's an ok phone. Ordered another Alcatel phone with a bigger screen and that's more advanced. I'll keep this one as a backup phone.
3128,Alcatel,Alcatel 1,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,Ps lo que casi no me agradÃ³ es que la carga disminuye un poco rÃ¡pido pero a comparaciÃ³n del precio estÃ¡ muy bien la verdad lo recomendarÃ­a mucho y lo volverÃ­a a comprar la cÃ¡mara frontal en video llamadas es excelente â¤ï¸

3138,Alcatel,Alcatel 1,16 GB,Android 8.1,5 Inches,"Bought this phone to use in Kenya and I wished I had just spent the money to buy a local phone.

I expected a 3/10 but this phone is a 7.5/10.You don't get what you pay for. You'll get way more than that!Good about this phone:- Fast shipping.- A lot of phone for your money.- High resolution screen. Way higher than I expected.- Okay camera, nothing special, but perfect for the low price.- Supports Android apps.- Easy to install.- Easy to set up a number (it took minutes).- Good touch screen.- Cheap prepaid calling and internet browsing. Good plans.- Allows you to import iPhone or Android contacts.- Bright flashlight.- Good online customer's service.What is not good about this phone:- Slow booting.- Installing takes long.- Sounds quality is not that great (but very acceptable).If you are in doubt, I recommend you to watch Youtube videos with reviews."
3148,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,Really like this purchase our son is 9 and we are not ready for him to have a cell phone hooked up to call but he uses it for games.  It is worth the money and he loves it.
3149,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"Tracfone is a terrible company. It has awful customer service and most of the website links are broken when you need help. The phone, however, is pretty good for being so inexpensive. I haven't had an issue with it yet."
3150,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,I get zero cell coverage at work with T-Mobile so I needed a phone just for emergencies and getting texts while there. Iâ€™m blown away by the quality of this phone for the price. I use an iPhone normally but yeah this one isnâ€™t bad at all. Runs my apps and even has facial recognition.
3151,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"it's alr, it's a good trap phone tho, def better  then nothing."
3152,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"This is the best budget phone for under $50 in 2022 right now. The only thing I wish they didnâ€™t do was include android 11. The cpu struggles with android 11. They should have put android 8 or 9 on it instead. Second thing is the display. Yes it does have ghosting when scrolling, but itâ€™s 1440p and looks really nice when watching videos on it. Overall it is the best. Better than Samsungs j3 for the same price."
3153,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"I'll give it a solid 4 star, it's the budget phone of all budget phones, if you need a burner phone or just something in a pinch, it'll get the job done. But don't expect it to be super fast and snappy and able to handle more than a couple apps. Also, the screen is rather dim even on full brightness. If you use it in bright sunlight a lot, may want to consider a different phone.-I'm not currently using the phone as a phone so I can't rate based on phone clarity or signal strength. I'm just using two of these as digital signage. I'm an Uber driver and I run the signage while I drive passengers around. Has become a hit."
3154,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"love the body of the phone indoors the screen is good but for out side your going to what to put you brightness up, the noise is good for the money, is can run all my fav games and in my opinion good for the money."
3155,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,The only negative comment I have is that the screen is so small.  That makes it difficult for old folks like me to see the screen
3156,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"I bought two of these and Phones for my kids to watch YouTube, itâ€™s perfect and very durable, sometimes if freezes up but I think itâ€™s because they have a few games on it that maybe too updated for the phone but otherwise the phone is great so far!!"
3157,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"I bought this phone to use as a gaming device for my kids. It works great as a cheap gaming device option. We do not use it as an actual phone, so can't speak to that though."
3158,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,I haven't opened it yet  it's for a gift.But super fast shipping. Definitely recommend
3159,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,Use this like an MP3 player. I love the fact that it has an SD slot.However the sound is a little tiny.
3160,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"This one is good! The volume can get  loud,  The sound is good.  The screen isn't too sensitive. It's simple and straight forward to use. It does have some features that more expensive phones have....face recognition, abilty to split screens, flip over to mute incoming calls.  The battery life is average.  I think this is going to be a reliable phone for me. It's not a dumb phone.I had an LG Rebel. The price was similar. The Rebel performed like a cheap phone, but was reliable in making and keeping calls. This is better quality  and has better sound quality. I had a Moto G pure. The Moto was very unreliable when trying to make a call.  It dropped calls a lot. Super sensitive screen,  but I loved the ""hello Moto"" ringtone."
3161,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"I used use tablet for music player or game but tablet is too slow, and it's also too expensive for faster one. This one is fast enough other expensive phone."
3162,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,Short life and then they freeze. Seem like a good deal but for my adjusted grandson to use for games around the house. The entire thing froze up wouldnâ€™t turn off turn on or anything nothing works and you couldnâ€™t open it up and take the battery out to reset it because the batteries wired up and totally trashed it wouldnâ€™t recommend it unless you just need something to throw away
3163,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,This phone would be a great phone if the battery didn't drain so quickly and it takes forever to charge. I don't care about anything fancy and just want a simple phone and for that it works great. I just wish it didn't take so long to charge it.
3164,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"I had the TCL A2 phone also purchased on Amazon a year ago and it worked beautifully for the price yet this model, the A3, seems to drain the battery within hours! Not good!"
3165,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"Just got this phone as an upgrade for my husband's older 3G phone, and it is okay, no problems, but compared to my  LG Rebel 4 it really lacks in some areas. Battery life for example is really bad with this TCL A3. For my husband's sporadic usage (emergency only), the battery will last several days, but with regular use (phone gets used for hours a day) I doubt the battery would even last one full day. So if you plan to use the phone a lot, I would get a different one. It's also pretty heavy (compared to LG Rebel 4) and it also seems to have less options for the user regarding adjusting/settings. Many options (again compared to Rebel 4) are not available (power saving for example), and I just would not purchase this phone (or any TCL at this point, really) again. It does function, however, no problems so far. It's just not what I would consider ideal."
3166,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"It's not a bad phone. Clear screen. Screenshots are easy but it can be slow to catch up and when you barely touch the screen, it jumps around and gets out of what you are doing. Photo sorting is not user friendly either. All in all, it's a decent phone."
3167,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"Came in factory package and in great condition. Does its job since I just do basic stuff like calls and text, some games. Not a bad buy."
3168,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,Nothing
3169,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,This phone is better than I had expected for such a low price. Bought it for my daughter to play games on since all the tablets I've bought her over the years have been trash. She's been able to download/play a really surprising amount on this phone with no problems. I'm definitely satisfied. Not sure I could find much better in this price range.
3170,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,U actually bought the phone for someone else.  The phone cut off and they had to call company and they said that they was sorry it was out of range they would fix. They went 2 days without a phone. And on top ok f that the data ran out over 2 hers.
3171,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,I couldn't beat the price to get a phone running Android 11 to strictly run various apps to run off of home Wi-Fi.
3172,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"My Granddaughter love this gift,"
3173,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,This is a great little phone - easy to use - in fact i got a second one to give to a family member.
3174,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"WARNING âš ï¸,  I dislike the fact that when I purchased this phone ...... I specifically asked if it was ""New"", got two messages from TracFone Guaranteeing that it was new..  that would mean it has a one-year warranty on parts and accessories as advertised on all TracFone packages,  Some of the rudest customer service reps I have ever dealt with.. lieing, hanging up, transferring to other dept's. ...telling me I only have a 90-day warranty and to go buy my own cord and plug,, and that accessories are not included???  LOL, Well you can't charge a phone if you don't have a cord and a charger... Also you better have good hearing because this phone is not loud even with speaker on. I have purchased and had accounts with TracFone since 2009 ..Goodbye TracFone,, You will be on the phone for hours so make sure you do not use your minute phone unless you have unlimited minutes.... I do think I got a refurbished phone and not a new one as advertised there are other issues with this phone,,,,BE CAREFUL PEOPLE!!!"
3175,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"This phone is not expensive. Bought 2 so far for the grandkids. So far, they are still working."
3176,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,I bought this phone to replace the seven or so year old phone I had and I like it. I can't speak on the face recognition or fingerprint reader since I don't use them but if you don't want an expensive phone I think this is an good way to go.
3177,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"Tracfone could not transfer my land line to my tracfone - wasted hours and days of my life.Tracfone could not make my phone work for calls, internet only - wasted hours and days of my life.I smashed it with a sledge hammer today - it cant hurt me anymore.Whats good is that Tracfone is a successful capitalist and more importantly saboteurs .They sabotaged me, my time, my money and the state of Kentucky and Uncle Sam out of tax dollars they would have collected from my buying time and data cards.When Americans sabotage one another they weaken the country - thank you Tracfone for being successful saboteurs or grotesquely successful capitalist - either way, America pays the price. More power to you Tracfone , lots of people hate America and Americans - I hope you had fun....live forever."
3178,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,Great phone. Replac3d an old phone
3179,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,Took a while to get used to it.
3180,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"This has been a nightmare trying to set it up, also we were unable to get it open to remove the SIM card, we had to drive to Walmart to have a tech open it. It still wonâ€™t make phone calls. Iâ€™m so disappointed in it. Unfortunately I canâ€™t return it because the time was only a month. I was unable to set it up and had to wait for help, but she couldnâ€™t do it either."
3181,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"I liked the price I brought the phone for a friend of mine because I over charged his, but by the time I got it his phone started working again"
3182,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,Nice phone for the money
3183,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,Got this for the grandkid and she loves it.
3184,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"When I received the phone the sim card wasn't inserted correctly so I had issues transferring my existing number to this phone. It took a few hours working with support but I was able to finally activate the phone. Two weeks later I added minutes or a plan to my phone. It's the same plan I've been purchasing for years now. Once I added the plan I received a message stating the plan was added. Once the plan was added my phone wouldn't make any calls or send any messages other than to support. I called and chatted with support many times over a 48 hour period because my phone wasn't working anymore. I was hung up on, laughed at, told to wait over 24 hours for the plan to appear, and the list goes on. If I realized what a hassle this would be I obviously would not have purchased it. I am debating whether I should return the phone now because what happens next month when I try to add another plan? Is it going to be another 48 hours without a phone and many hours working with a terrible support team. I don't know how many times support told me that they didn't have the tools necessary to resolve my problem. If they don't have the tools who does?"
3185,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,It may work in Usa but not oversees.
3186,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"A phone for my son, thank you"
3187,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,Bought for toddlers was cheaper than replacing tablets. No issues works great had no problems connecting to wifi. No compliants
3188,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,3-GB of ram. Takes 3 seconds to turn it into a dumb phone. Got the most bang for the buck.Can't beat that with a stick.
3189,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,Battery is ok lasts about 6 to 10 hrs depending on usage its a cheap phone good for business use disposable i never have them long enough to try biometrics
3190,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,All i can say is you get what you pay for. Very low quality phone.
3191,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,This was the exact phone my daughter wanted and it met all of her expectations
3192,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,I brought this phone for my granddaughter.  The phone has no settings you have to reboot the phone and start all over in my case the voice kept talking it could not be turn off unless you reboot the phone and then the phone would not even reboot . Worse phone ever
3193,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"A fine upgrade to any older modest cellphone.Adequate ram, screen, storage, and Android OS level for any basic or mid-range user.Continues to function after some resent RF band shutdowns which many older phones can't do.Does the basics well.  Not 5G."
3194,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,no sim card
3195,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"Works out of the box with wi-fi, which was it's intended use."
3196,TracFone,TCL A3,32 GB,Android,5.5 Inches,"The power charger sucks; loose, and always disconnecting and reconnecting. This is just another crappy phone from Alcatel TCL; save your money and not buy from Alcatel TCL; dealt with overheating battery, touch screen glitches and update crashes. Will never recommend Alcatel TCL phones."
3197,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"I don't use face recognition so I can't say how well it works, but for the first week at any rate, the on-screen fingerprint reader has been amazingly easy to use.  I don't use my phone super heavy and it's not uncommon to have 70% or more battery when I put it on the wireless charger at night, and it's *significantly* less picky about placement on the wireless charger than the old phone (note 8).  The car has wireless charging and it's also much better charging there; the old one would often not be in the right place and not get any electrons, where this never fails to juice up.I got the Note 20 because it's the last Note (currently) that has an SD card slot; I'm absolutely against some company gouging me hundreds of dollars extra for a 256GB phone when a 512GB SD card is under 50 bucks.  The drawback to that is this phone came with pretty much nothing at all but a charging cable, which isn't really adding any value.  It took me some time to find a way to get the SD card slot open, without their custom tool, because on this phone at least the hole is waaayyyy too small for a paper clip.  I finally unwound the spring from an ink pen, which was small enough and stiff enough to release it.  Seriously leave out the cable that probably everyone in the world has by now and put that tool in!  It's needed for the SIM even without an SD card.Speaking of SIM, moving my line to this phone was trivially simple.  The phone was apparently on T-Mobile previouisly and I'm on Verizon, and everything worked flawlessly right from the phone.  Put the SIM in, turned it on, and followed the instructions.  Done.I got a Note because, well, I've been a Note fanboy since the 4, when my old Droid with the hardware keyboard gave up the ghost, because of the S-Pen.  It's not something I use every day, but when I do use it, there is literally no alternative that works like the S-Pen.  If Samsung ever stops putting that on their phone I'll probably move on to something more affordable.This is my first ever refurb, and this one at least is exactly what one would hope; it physically indistinguishable from a brand new phone.  Even close observation in the light reveals no scratches or blemishes, it hasn't crashed or exhibited any wonky behaviour (knocks on head), and it's significantly snappier than the old one.  That's not just because it has more resources, I think it's because the UI has been tweaked.  For example when scrolling a long list this phone's ""inertia"", how long it scrolls untouched after a flick up or down, is much higher than the old phone, so it's considerably faster to browse by scrolling.  I'm sure other improvements have been made as well, and together they translate into a much more responsive feel.The OS itself is similar to the Note 8, really, but it has even more bloat and unremovable cruft in it.  For exampe there's ""AR"" functionality now, but even though I have nothing AR, and if I do it's highly unlikely I'll use this phone in conjunction with it.  There's an ""AR Zone"" that can't be disabled, can't be removed, can't be told not to nag me with notifications, can't be managed in the slightest.  Seriously Samsung, get off your high horse.  You don't know what I want my phone to do; fine if you want to have that enabled by default, why do I care?  But can't disable it or remove all the massively huge list of permissions?  Want to rub some salt in there for me?  It's also considerably more in-your-face nagging about things; like I haven't figured out how to get it to stop nagging me to save passwords for web sites, as if the last fifteen times I'd change my mind.  Stuff like that isn't helpful, it's obtuse and rude.Migration was a PitA, but that's normal, so I mention it anecdotally.  Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" does make it less than heinously atrocious, but ""Everything"" isn't (everything), and it still took me days to get all my appointments and other things loaded in.  Once I find my browser bookmarks and get them in I'll finally be done.  Least favorite part of getting a new phone is setting the @*% up.  I can back up and restore a computer with trivial ease but no phone maker yet is smart enough to do that with a phone.  Pathetic.I considered only four stars because of the missing SD card tool.  Not sure how many folks would be able to figure out how to open it with the hole being about 2/3 the diameter of a paper clip, which is by the way what Verizon recommends using if one can't find the tool.  I have no straight pins so I don't know if they work, but if I did I'd still want to file the point off to be sure I didn't damage anything.But overall a VERY happy camper.  If you like Android it's likely you'll be satisfied with this phone, and if you've never had an S-pen you'll probably be hooked.  lol"
3198,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"Noticed that the center of the screen has almost like screen burn damage. I would return it but am not sure if the replacement will be as in good state as this phone. It has virtually no cosmetic issue, other than a scrape on the S pen. The Finger print reader is also a little hit or miss. I think that it might be the screen protector. Not sure. The batter is telling me it is in good condition. Not sure what the highest is but so far lasts me 1.5 days and thats of constant use like playing games, watching videos, scrolling through SNS. So far satisfied with the purchase but am a little dissapointed about the faint screen burn when looking at dark images or when a video is loading. It looks like a faint blurry thick ""H"" or two rectangles. No issues so far though. Happy with my purchase"
3199,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"I know they discontinued the note line an went to the S22 ultra phone. My heart was really set on the Ultra S22, but my budget said I can't afford $1100.00 and I didn't want to be locked in a contract. I did the next best thing and that was  purchasing a refurbished note 20 ultra. I was really skeptical since it said it was unlocked for all carriers. When I got the phone I really felt disappointed because it wasn't the phone I wanted. Also it was from a Verizon carrier, which that didnt matter since I have Verizon which made it easy to get the phone turned on. I was really shocked with the features the phone has. It didn't come with a sim card, but it's duel Sim capable, which means it has a virtual Sim so I didn't have to wait to get a sim card. After playing around with the phone, I really love how nice it is. The camera isn't as good as the ultra S22, but it's very nice and probably can't really tell the difference.  It may be slightly slower, but it's faster than any phone I ever had and I probably wouldn't know any different between the phones.  I'm just touching the surface of what it's capable of doing and for around $450.00 plus a warranty, I believe I made the right choice for me and if your having budget issues and having the same issues then just get the note 20 ultra. You can always return it if it's not for you."
3200,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"Bought the Note 20 ultra to replace my old and cracked Note 8. I looked at the new S22 and even a refurbished S21, but they were too pricey for me. My maximum price was $500, not $1,000+. My fiance bought a Note 20 Ultra new last year and she pays monthly for it with a total cost of like $1,300. I have been around technology for many years and it is worse than cars. Technology depreciates fast and I refuse to throw money away like that. I buy used for that reason.Anyway, this phone is fast and looks brand new. Battery life is amazing on it. Not much more to say really, Samsung makes quality products. I will say there is less bloatware provided compared to what Samsung used to ship.One thing to note regarding buying an unlocked phone not tied to a carrier. There are no carrier specific apps on the phone, you get the stock apps. This is a problem with the Visual Voicemail app, at least with AT&T. That app does not work with AT&T voicemail service (at least on the Note 20 Ultra). AT&T apparently provides a voicemail app, but it cannot be downloaded from the play store. This means you will have to check voicemail the old fashion way by holding 1 in the phone keypad and dialing into the service. It is kind of a pain in the a$$. If someone else found an app that works or a way to get the AT&T app, please comment for me and others."
3201,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"Wow!!! all I can say is I am shocked I was very hesitant on buying a renewed phone it took me a few days to pull the trigger and I'm glad I did. Seller stated excellent condition it shipped and arrived in 3 days very well packed (box in a box)I took it out of the box and it is flawless absolutely mint I put it under a lamp with my glasses on couldn't find a single blemish, mark, or scratch nothing. I would give 20 stars if I could, I have been using it for 3 days now if anything changes I will update, very happy with my purchase."
3202,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"After years of owning frustrating phones that had serious problems, I have finally stumbled upon a winner.  I read consumer reviews about the S22 Ultra and decided to give it a try.  It is far and away the best phone I've had yet.  It is slender and easy to hold.  It's screen clarity is amazing.  And so far, absolutely no bugs at all.  I had to smile when I went to have this phone's SIM card installed by my phone provider, because the technician owns this phone, too.  He said it was his best phone as well, and told me that the old one I was giving up (A53) was pretty junky."
3203,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"I ordered the factory unlocked bronze 128GB in excellent pre-owned/refurb condition. I am replacing my Verizon Note9 and jumping ship to Google Fi. The phone was factory unlocked and no carrier popped up when booting up the device. Loaded up my new sim and I was good to go. The phone was in great condition, except for a small, noticeable scratch on the power button. A little wear on the charging port, but the phone almost looked new to an extent. 12GB RAM. Camera works well. Battery is OK enough. Screen was perfect. Bronze color is matte, not glossy. I purchased a soft screen protector and it fits with an OtterBox. It came with a usb-c cord and charging brick. The charging brick was a havEarly brand, not Samsung, and would get so hot it burnt my hand. I tossed it out after a few charges out of fear it would cause a fire. The tiny scratch and the defective charging brick are very frustrating. That said, I am a Note guy. I started with the Note3 and I am sad to see this line go. I will use this bad boy for a few years and put it on backup for the next one. Very happy I went this route as the Note series is iconic.Update: Phone fell on ground and S-Pen came out and snapped in half from fall. This is the first time this has happened with any Note I've owned. I ordered a factory replacement on Amazon for $20 to replace, but not happy. The broken S-Pen looked pretty cheaply made. I hadn't really used it much yet, but my luck."
3204,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"When buying a refurbrished phone u expect it to be brand new right? Well it varies but usually some ""excellent"" quality for phones usually have some small scratches or dents but other than that the phone works as intended and was definitely worth the upgrade but i kinda prefer the way the fingerprint thing works on my older phone(lg stylo 5) but hey at least the stulus is top notch and feels good to use to draw if ur an artist."
3205,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"I was skeptical to buy a 'renewed' phone when I was used to buying new phones. I didn't want to spend the crazy price tag of new phones so I opted for this. When I received the phone via the faster than expected shipping, I noticed there were a few scratches on the top of the phone but I had to remind myself that this was not a brand new device. Despite that, so far, the device works perfect and the battery life is excellent. The minor buffs and scratches are covered by my case anyway so I guess it's ok. The phone screen had zero scratches and looks fine. I'm happy with the purchase. Thank you."
3206,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,I highly recommend buying from this seller. This phone came to me in complete 100% condition. It has absolutely no scratches or cracks or blemishes anywhere at all. It's seriously brand new condition. It came with a high-speed charger as well. Everything works extremely great as it should and I have had no problems at all with it. This is the absolute best and nicest phone I've ever owned and I will always be buying from the Amazon renewed phone program instead of buying brand new. I got a brand new phone for over half the price. You cannot beat that at all. And Amazon guarantees these phones and if you don't like it you can send it back for your money back or a different one. I highly suggest buying from this seller though because his phones are 100% brand new looking. I looked hard and could not find a single blemish on this phone. It's absolutely perfect and I will be buying from this seller everytime I need a new phone.
3207,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"So far this cell meets all of my expectations. The arrival box wasn't pretty but the products inside are truly like new. The screen is always on and the clarity incredible, the battery lasts about 1 1/2 days and charging is quick. I'm about 3 weeks into my Note 20 and so far I'm very happy. If that changes I will append this review."
3208,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"Bought this off Amazon as a refurb unlocked phone.  It arrived and looks great.  But it started up saying verizon and didn't want to use my TMobile sim.  Ugh.  I rebooted and as it stated up that time it asked if I wanted to switch to TMobile.  I said yes,  and after a moment it started right up with the TMobile splash screen and has been working perfectly.  Still getting to know this phone,  I had to replace my S21+ that was stepped on by horses.What I've noticed so far -  the photos are amazing.  Much better than the S21.  The screen is much brighter,  I have to leave it as half or less.  Battery time seems to last longer,  but I haven't tested that much as this is only day 2 with this one.Very pleased so far."
3209,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,I bought a renewed cellphone that was described as unlocked. Also said it would be compatible with my provider. Phone was not unlocked. Esim and sim card number were still registered in phone. My cell provider could do nothing with it. They tried everything and said the previous company would have to do it. They were from a different location. Who knows who that is. Hope I have good luck returning it. Phone itself seems great.
3210,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,Got this to replace a Note 9 I dropped.  Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G is a very nice phone.  Very fast.  Good build quality.  Needed a little optimization to slow down the battery discharge rate.  Got a 1TB SSD at the same time.  Not using my PC so much these days 'cause the phone pretty much does it all except for software that needs a regular computer to run.  Voice Recog is much better than typing although souther accent is sometimes problematic.  Now I need to find a non-bulky case so this phone won't break if I drop it...
3211,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"Purchased a S20 Note Ultra, the phone came on time, the phone looked great,the screen has no scratches, the back had no scratches, Only blemish is on the top boarder where the Sim slot is. Who ever had this phone first kept it in the case. The phone wasn't unlocked though, it was still attached to someone's account. Once I found out that it was locked to AT&T ( By calling Samsung and them telling me it was locked to AT&T)THEN I CALLED AT&T and they unlocked it with really no issues. Be on the lockout for if you have this issue there'd a site that says you can unlock your AT&T phone for $107 DONT DO IT IF YOU RUN INTO THAT. Phone feels new, and operates like new. Like me, you may get mad at first, but if you have to get it unlocked just call Samsung first to see who it's locked to."
3212,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"Bought this from seller: Last Of The Loot. Phone looks completely new. I believe it was labeled as ""Excellent condtion"". Can't argue with that. Great buying experience, phone came unlocked and had zero issues activating it. As for the Note 20 Ultra; great phone in nearly every aspect. The screen though is noticeably dimmer and lest vibrant than the note 10 or even 9. This is most obvious when held side by side. Otherwise no complaints."
3213,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"I had a Note 20 Ultra for a year. When it got damaged the repair facility damaged it more so I got a Galaxy S22 Ultra. The quality, feel and look of the Note Ultra are so much better I'm still debating getting this phone and returning the S22. The photo quality is nearly identical too."
3214,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"Realmente este equipo viene prÃ¡cticamente nuevo, llego sin ningÃºn rasguÃ±o y sin ningÃºn defecto, lo Ãºnico que note es que el S Pen dura demasiado tiempo en reaccionar y viene un poco quebrado"
3215,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"Love this phone! I received it in the mystic bronze color. Works wonderfully and looks so beautiful! Fingerprint reader not recognizing my entire thumb print to set it up, maybe due to screen protector? Using password security instead. So I am happy. ğŸ˜Š  Screen looks awesome ğŸ’–  Purchased mine as renewed and unlocked.  Worth every penny."
3216,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"Branded as the best phone ever made by Samsung when it debuted in August 2020. Whilst discontinued in December 2021, it is still a great phone. I bought mine refurbished and it was nearly-new condition. The face recognition generally works well although for the fingerprint scanner, I sometimes have to press it twice or for a few seconds before it recognises my thumb, not deal breakers. Whilst the camera is good, it takes a little getting used to. Whereas before you switched to macro mode to take a close up, now the lens recognises what you are trying to do and automatically adjusts. That doesn't always work well but you do end up getting the shot. The curved edges, while looking cool, gets in the way when I'm using the S pen too close to the edge and often find that the back button kicks in - rather annoying but I can fix that in gestures. Overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase."
3217,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"Love this phone! I had an old samsung s7 and about time I got a new phone. This is beautiful, functional,  intuitive, easily transferred everything from my old phone without any issues. Battery life is great. I charge when it gets around 15% and in settings, I make sure it does not charge past the 85% mark to ensure long lasting battery life in the future. I do not plug in at night, the fast charger charges  super quick so no need. The only complaint is that it rocks when set on its back, due to camera."
3218,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"I was worried about this unlocked phone.  It came in great condition.  There was one tiny speck issue on the glass of the back camera, not in the camera range so I'm not worried about it.  It is a good value."
3219,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"This phone is really great.  It has excellent sound quality and the camera is the best.  I also love the fact that it has great battery life.  Great purchase, Iâ€™m very satisfied."
3220,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"My Note 20 Ultra in black came from the seller ASAJ Wireless and it's indeed in excellent condition. The only cosmetic defects I can see/feel are two small nicks on the bottom below the screen and maybe some wear around the charge port, but everything else looks brand new. It works flawlessly as far as I can tell.For the phone itself it's pretty nice. I finally upgraded from a Note 8 I've had for 4 years and one thing I love about Samsung phones is how easy it is to get apps, data, layout, etc moved over between phones so everything is where i want it and there's not much to get used to. Then I just switched my sim card and I was good to go."
3221,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,The phone worked great and after some time i stopped working. When I contacted the seller  they were able to resolve the issue and repaired it within a few days.
3222,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,So far very good.
3223,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,Pues la verdad Llo e comprado ymedalen buenÃ­simos muy bien funcionamiento estoy encantada
3224,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,The best phone I ever had was the Note 3 and I still have it.  I was going to purchase the flip but I decided to get the Note 20 ultra 5g and I'm not disappointed in any way. When my phone came the s pen wasn't working so I contacted the seller they apologized and sent another one right away.....overall a great experience with the  seller and a great phone
3225,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,The phone arrived as described and have had no issues at all. Shipping was as described and fast.
3226,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,Note series always good. But this refurbished set battery life is not good. Very quocm to finished and need to power bank.
3227,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"Very small (insignificant) scratches in screen, small wear to camara, and the three months of return coverage was certainly good incentive to give it a try. I am satisfied with my purchase, so much so I'm unsure if I'll ever by new again."
3228,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"Overall the phone look like new, the screen saver was not great but it will be replaced, I use the phone to check my diabetes with  the Dexcom G6 cGM system,  it works just great for this use, he phone works great, looks new  came in factory box,I will buy reworked phone again."
3229,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"I actually ended up purchasing 2, one for my daughter and myself. Both look great, work great, and are worth every penny.The fingerprint sensor can get a little finicky at times but no worse than later model Samsung models.I highly recommend this phone."
3230,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,Like new and good for the price.
3231,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"First I want to mention that the phone came in like new condition. The note 20 ultra has everything you need plus features you no longer get in many current phones, i.e expandable storage and a 6.9 premium display. I love everything about it."
3232,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"I upgraded from the Note 10+, and this phone is better in every way...size, feel, speed, battery life, looks, accessories, and superb camera quality.The only possible downside for some may be that there's no way to comfortably use this phone without a case."
3233,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"Purchased from the seller CPOMobile since I couldn't find a complaint on their sellers home page. And needless to say I myself have absolutely no complaints. The phone literally looks and works as if it was brand new, with absolutely no scratches on the screen nor body. They system is working smoothly, and the camera works Great! I couldn't find this phone anywhere else even close for the price of $465!! Maybe I got lucky but the seller definately deserves a review for the price and quality of there product.-Also I have Verizon and I just popped my Sim card in and nothing else, didn't have to call Verizon or anything."
3234,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"After a solid month of use its still holding up great with no complaint, came as expected, the only damage on mine is only visible if you can really close"
3235,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"I've gotten a renewed phone before and it came in messed up and I was never able to get it fixed, so I was kinda worried about purchasing this one, thinking the same thing would happen, but it came in and once I tested out the speakers/sounds/calls/camera/charger/connectivity/sims card, etc.., I realized this is perfect and I haven't came across any errors! My Sims connected easily (I have Mint Mobile) and WiFi connected just fine. I think I actually have a really ""win"" here!! I'm so relieved that I didn't get scammed!"
3236,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"I received a well preserved renewed Galaxy Nore 20 ultra 5G today. After I set it up, it works very well. Pretty close to the new one I bought 20 months ago when the model came out first. I have bought about 80% new and 20% renewed of all my electronics especially smartphones. I was very satisfied with my purchases. But this one was filthy, physically....front and rear screen have so much human residue filth material on it, I tried baby wipes, cotton towels with water, (I don't want to use bleach or soap), I tried anything I could think to NOT damage the hardware. It's has been impossible to clean. Very sad bc the phone works like new. I put it aside. It makes me wanna vomit when I touch it."

3244,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.9 Inches,"For a refurbished phone it was just about flawless.

3247,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"This review comes from the perspective of a person who has never owned a Samsung or Apple device. If you're reading this and it's not on sale, and you don't mind the big guys... Keep it moving. This phone isn't worth the asking price on build quality alone. But if you see this anywhere under 8 hundos, and you're ready to buy the optional 68 watt charger (moto made, and verified compatible) then read on my friend, and let tell you about this hidden gem.Build quality: Looks good, but can feel a bit cheap with the plastic frame. Buy a case and forget about it ( I got a Poetic case). The volume buttons are above the power button, you get used to it but still not the best configuration. The phone does heat up while gaming, charging the battery, and taking pictures. HOWEVER, after having done a throttle test, I can tell you that the heat management is very good, and the performance loss never dipped under 80% over half an hour, nor did temperatures pass 50c.Hardware:Screen is accurate but not bright, with slightly cooler tones out of the box. There are limited adjustment options available in settings. Direct sunlight visibility is just OK, definitely functional. The auto frame rate adjust is great and saves battery... But that 144 frame rate is buttery smooth.Signal : I'm on At&t, and initially assumed that I would be stuck on 4g. First I installed the sim, then At&t sent an update a day later and after resetting the phone 5G was available!!! No dropped or missed calls at all.Speakers are loud but a bit tinny until adjusted. Dolby equaliser should be set to film (surround sound) and pick the treble boost Sub option. Bass boost sub options are available as well. If you leave Dolby on automatic, they focus more on voices than music, so it's great for non music target.Battery life is pretty good on a heavy day, excellent for everyday use. Easily getting over 6 - 7 SoT, even with heavy use ( ex. hours of YouTube playback, Genshin Impact, taking pictures, and making calls) I haven't dipped anywhere near the 5's. The optional 68 watt charger has me topped off in a little less than an hour. Buy it, it makes the phone into a certified beast. This phone can also charge other devices when they are connected via USB c cable.Camera : physically very cool design, motorala's photo app is not so cool. Strange colour science they chose to roll with for photos. It is the phone's greatest weakness. Xda forums has a working version of Gcam alongside the. Xml config file. It changes everything! All of a sudden, you're in the big boy camera game too. And you can even change Gcam to the default camera for your moto gestures!gcam-for-edge-x30-edge-30-pro-edge-plus-2022-working-night-mode-face-retouch-config-file.4391919/#post-86297887..... This is a clue how you get there. Research how to use the xml file and where to put it. Good luck.Software :Its stock android with moto mods mixed in. The unlocked version doesn't come with a lot of useless apps. If you're obsessed with security updates then you won't like it.  You can use whichever launcher you want, but I think stock does a pretty good job.The software excitement comes with Ready For (aka Motorola Dex) Trust me guys n gals, it's legitimate and not a gimmick. I've played emulators on big screens, checked my emails with portable monitors, and basically made my laptop obsolete. It's that dang good. Plus it can recognise the display output of the device it's connected to and adjust. Get yourself a Bluetooth keyboard, a Usbc to hdmi cable, and a Bluetooth video game remote. The all in one experience is finally here, there, and anywhere a compatible device can be connected or cast to.Pro tips: Apt-X is a Bluetooth audio codec, and it makes compatible headphones sound truly amazing. I've found that Apt-X Adaptable can be a bit laggy on this phone, and honestly didn't change much more than normal Apt-X. Trust me, if you don't know anything about Bluetooth codecs and wonder if it's worth the hassle, just try it once for comparison and thank me later.The Motorola Edge+2022 has less available resources under this name as compared to Motorola Edge 30 pro. They're the same phone and can share the same resources. This will double the amount of advice and information you can find.Even though it looks like the sim tray can accept two cards... It can't. I tried.Developer mode . Change the animation speed to x.5, change the default Bluetooth codec, change the World. Don't play around too much or you'll brick your phone. Every time you connect a new device you'll have to check the Bluetooth codec option to change it. The phone should do it automatically after the first time.If you've made it this far.. Thank you for taking the time. If you do decide to buy this phone, I'd like to welcome you to a very small and exclusive group of people. We found our diamond in the rough, and with any luck it's going to carry us (with 2 major updates and 3 years of security support) into a whole new world of productivity and awesome. Hello ğŸ‘‹ Moto... LET'S GO!!!"
3248,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"The phone's screen is bright and amazing. I haven't really done anything to push the limit of the refresh rate but it cruises at 60fps. The sound from it is equally great as it has Dolby Atmos. You may not fully notice it's affects untill you stream your audio. The battery last and charges fast too. The only hiccup I've had is that the screen will receive touch inputs from from the slight touch, which is noticable when holding the phone with one hand. Overall, it's a great phone currently at it's sale price."
3249,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"The Motorola Edge Plus seems like a good phone with the top of the line Processor, a good amount of storage and memory, however once you start using the Motorola Edge Plus, you'll soon realize that it is overpriced.Again with Android 12, phones are so bland and the Motorola Edge Plus is no exception. All Google apps for the services (Phone, Keyboard, contacts, gallery, files, Messages) with very little personality for the phone itself.The file system is fairly responsive even with a ton of pictures, the screen resolution is good, however the cameras are about right for a $300 phone. No external storage nor a headphone jack.The worst part is the touch screen inaccuracies, so many times the phone thinks I am scrolling horizontal when I was scrolling vertical. That is the most annoying part. Again, very little customization due to Android 12 and phone manufacturers giving up on adding any personality to the phone that makes it stand out from any other phone.I really don't understand the joint effect with Phone manufacturers and Android on making all phones exactly the same as any other phone on the market. Bland and boring OS layouts matching any other phone with few features and customization. It's sad.In short, if you need a phone for voice conversations, checking Facebook and uploading video to TicToc, this phone will work for you."
3250,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,Get it instead of the ultra expensive guys.  They're phone 6 with perks. This one is worth it.
3251,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"Very unhappy with sound quality after all the bragging by Motorola on the Dolby speakers, doesn't sound any better than my LG stylo5"
3252,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"great device, awesome visuals, kick ass performance, great speakers, just slippery as all hell, and the screen is make with 2018 gorilla glass, the back glass is stronger then the front, as I've discovered.Arrived on the 5th, first drop on the 13th, yesterday, and dispite having a ""tempered glass 9 hardness"" screen protector installed, the display shattered on the first drop when a corner impacted the floor inside, and the gap on the crappy screen protector did not cover the glass.The case? Yes, I bought a case with the phone, delivered by Amazon, delayed until who knows when, it's missed it's delivery twice.Becareful, the display is hella delicate."
3253,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"Horrible battery life even when not in use.  I'm now going to try running it in battery saver mode all the time just to see if that helps.  I had gone from a full charge to zero in less than 8 hours without the battery saver on and I was not running anything.  Also, I had to adjust the screen sensitivity because I have to constantly tap on something in order for it to work. That still didn't accomplish anything. I still have to tap screen multiple times. The sensitivity issue isn't constant.  Sometimes I'll tap on something and that app will work on the first tap while other times I'll tap and it doesn't work. You almost think you're going insane as you tap harder and harder trying to resist the urge to throw your phone against the wall."
3254,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"phone has lots tutorials for non techies like myself Has same features as an I phone with out the cost. Great screen size,color is gorgeous, very intuitive & fun. has an Alexa, tons of other features I haven't set up yet.  Haven't tried facial recognition or fingerprint, so I can't comment Overall I think it's a great buy, for the technology & price"
3255,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"Only one speaker on bottom, sounds no good. Battery life not so good but charging time fast. Low light photo not as good as my 3 years old 1+7 pro. I like only its cpu and 512 gb memory, otherwise I won't buy it."
3256,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"I have been using Motorola phones since the Droid Turbo, and since I've trusted the brand for so long, I figured I'd go with it again.Pros:Great Gaming Performance (Tested Dolphin and AetherSX2, and it is almost perfect)Boost Up to 10 GB RAMFast loading times144hz screenCons:Small Volume buttonsMediocre battery life (at least at 144hz, it's just fine at 60hz)Mediocre CameraI feel most people would go more towards a Samsung, Google Pixel, or One Plus phone when going for Android, but if you don't feel like moving off of a brand that youve trusted for years like me, this is a great alternative and I do not regret my purchase in the slightest."
3257,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"I love that this phone is bigger than most. Easier to see! I haven't tried the fingerprint reader yet. It has a great battery life. And the super fast charger is amazing! The only thing I don't like about it so far is how the camera lenses on the back of the phone, cause it to wobble when it is laid flat and you use your touch screen. I am in the process of getting a case for it. I hope that takes care of the problem. I also love the silvery white color of the phone. Takes awesome photos too. Great sound quality."

3260,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"We have had much success with Motorola phones and this one did not disappoint.  As with any new phone, it does take a while to get use to how it operates.  Overall it works well and has been the best phone we have had from Motorola."
3261,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"The phone is great. Amazon service is not. The item description says ""Smart stylus for pinpoint precision.

3264,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,This Seller S & G Trading is dishonest and mispresents what he sells.  i asked him was this phone used refurbished or repiared in any way. He said New. No the phone was not new within 1 1/2 weeks I started to have numerous problems to point it was not working properly failing. I had to buy another phone from Amazon the same Motorola Edge+ which is working perfectly.  I reported all this to Amazon asking for a return label from seller & full refund of money. Seller delayed subiting a return label for weeks & I never heard from him until after weeks of aggravation Amazon got him to send a return label. Did S & G Trading give me a full refund NO.  Buyer BEWARE do NOT Deal with. BTW seller hides his bad feednack & grays it out so it is not seen by customers this was verfied also.
3265,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"S22 ultra or the moto edge +2022 I think the edge factor is a best bet. It's cheaper, has a 512 gb of storage, and last longer. I prefer the flat poled over the curve screen ambled."

3269,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"I've had many Motorola phones, and 2 of the last 3 have had the screen shattered by a short fall. The glass goes to the edge which looks nice but shatters at the slightest contact with a hard surface. The phone itself is very good. The screen is bright enough to be seen in sunlight. The stereo speakers have decent volume and sound quality. If you buy one (definitely worth it for a good sale price) order at least a bumper edge case and a screen protector and you will probably be very pleased with the Edge+ 2022."
3270,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,Slid off my lap and screen broke. Had the phone for 2 days
3271,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"It's a beautiful and very responsive phone.  Battery screen life is only 2-3 hours despite my best efforts and 2 consultations with Motorola tech support.  If you don't use the screen then it's still only 5 hours before it dies.  The super fast charging (I purchased the 64 watt charger) makes up for it unless of course I'm away from an electric outlet which I am most of the time.  Out in the woods and the phone dies. VERY BAD!For my own safety as well as mental health I returned the phone and got a refund within 7 days as promised.  My next step is I ordered last year's model with an LCD screen and it is almost as fast but has a 2-day battery life!Don't get this phone for $700 (List price $1,000) .Get the Motorola Edge 2021 for brand new for $329."
3272,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"I got this phone on sale. Basically it was free. Otherwise I would feel cheated on the quality of this phone compared to my other Motorola phones.Pros1. Durable, I have a cheap case and have dropped many times with no problems.2. Fast internet service3.Plenty of memory4.Fast rechargeCons1) Battery life is one day with moderate use at best. Probably the worst battery life of the phones I have owned. Do not see this phone lasting 2years.2)Needs to restart every few days due to freezing up.3) Zoom Pic quality is very poor. Avg camera at bestI will more than likely pay off phone early and may switch to the new Samsung.  If you get the phone super cheap it's worth it, if not I would not recommend this phone."
3273,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"Was looking at phones for a while and got a decent deal on this one. Never had a Moto phone. Coming from an aging LG Thinq and Pixel.Yes they cut a few corners with not giving it ip68 and a true zoom cam, but Motorola offers something no other phone makers can: Ready for.""Ready for"" is a dumb name for great software that allows you to instantly turn your phone into a desktop, media box, or com-center by simply connecting it to a screen with a USBC to display (HDMI) cable (or USBc hub).I read some reviews of ""Ready for"", but it outperformed my expectations. It's intuitive and mostly seemless. Just plug in and boom.I hooked mine up through a USBc hub and even plugged in a USB keyboard and USB mouse and it worked flawlessly. I had a full dekstop environment from my phone, in 4k 60hz no less.I later plugged in a wireless controller via the same hub and boom, Android gaming full screen.On the surface maybe this phone appears mediocre: The processing power is great (best in class), the camera is good (but not best in class), and they went cheap on a few materials...But if you look past the hardware into what the software on this phone is capable of (paired with it's processing power) it's fantastic and untouched by competitors.A note on Samsungs Dex and why it's not as good: It's not as intuitive or seemless, and you need Samsung interfaces to do certain things... Whereas ""Ready for"" just works,and works better."
3274,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"Just search ""motorola edge black spots screen"".Even that I bought my edge at motorola oficial store in Argentina it does not have any scratch or damage, they claim that their know issue on motorola edge screen was because I vandalize the phone.This was my second  motorla phone (My first was a quench one of the first phone and it got useless only after a few months because they never relized android update)MOTOROLA NEVER AGAIN!"
3275,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,This phone is faster than the Edge 2021. I have a Pixel 6 pro and the Moto moves faster and has more storage and I love the Moto actions. The camera is great but not as good as the Pixel 6 pro. I love the qi wireless charging they added. The battery lasts me a good 15 hours with heavy usage. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great phone.
3276,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"Have the pixel 6, then I got this and wow this is what the pixel 6 should have been for performance with the cameras of the pixel 6 this would be an absolute amazing phone. The cameras are good but not as nice as the 6, but the phone performance and moto software is amazing!!!"
3277,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,8gb of ram(2gb of ram extra in setting) +512 gb of storage. That's a nice deal. Tested the s22u and this phone. The thermals is better with this phone for playing games and video calls
3278,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"I use to be a big fan of Motorola. I had the moto edge 2020, that came with a nice aluminum frame, sd slot, headphone jack and underscreen finger print scanner and was looking forward to upgrading, this was a $700 phone when new. Now for being almost $1000, you get a cheap plastic frame and plastic back on this phone, No metal. Iv had a number of moto phones with the same build and after a year or two you will see significant wear marks on it and that's even with a good case on it. Add to the fact they have removed the sd card slot, head phone jack and went to a side mount fingure print sensor, and it's not even waterproof.  It's just not worth it imo. One other thing to note, that iv come to notice from Motorola is that there software support is TERRIBLE. This phone may get 1 major os update, MAYBE 2 if your really lucky.  Compared to Samsung and Google that's provided up to 4 major os updates to there phones."
3279,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"My last phone had an echo and drove everyone nuts, I upgraded to this.  So far good phone, no complaints."
3280,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"This has been one of the most responsive and quick device I've ever owned. I've been a galaxy user for many years, but the thought of spending a grand on a flagship these days is just to much for me. When the Motorola went on sale I decided to take a chance on there deeply discounted flagship phone. I'm very pleased with my decision and my new phone."
3281,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,Great value and great performance. Comes with the same software thats on the pixel 6 and it comes with 12 gb of ram that I can boost to 15! Amazing phone.Another review gave it 1 star because it fell and broke. I suggest using a case and screen protector because mine has fallen a few times and it is fine.
3282,Motorola,Motorola Edge+,512 GB,Android 12,6 Inches,"This phone has a big, beautiful screen. It is very sharp and bright enough even in full sunlight. It has a fast, powerful processor with lots of RAM and storage. It is an elegant and powerful machine and it fits my hand perfectly. Face unlock works well. The fingerprint sensor is on the power button. I see absolutely no advantage to moving the fingerprint sensor from the back but it is better to be on the power button than that awful in screen sensor other phones are using. The placement of the sensor makes a case  very awkward, I don't use the Motorola case I bought for this phone because it is hard to reach the fingerprint sensor.The blue glass back is very attractive but it has scratches already, after just a couple of weeks.The camera is quite nice but has no optical zoom and does not perform very well in low light situations.The phone is splash resistant but likely will not survive being dropped in water.ReadyFor is a cool feature. I've used it several ways and at the very least it turns this phone into an outstanding web cam that follows me as I move around my office.Motorola is promising two major updates, to Android 14, and Motorola is glacially slow with the updates.Its performance is flawless and bug free so far but the Pixel 7 Pro was released last week with a generous trade in for my Pixel 3xl that makes it essentially the same price as this phone.My Pixel should arrive this week.One of these phones, the Pixel 7 Pro or the Motorola Edge + 2022 will have to be returned."
3283,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"Bought this phone to replace a Samsung. Very happy with the price, having 128 GB.I'm not real tech savvy, but watched a video on google, and it helped a lot.  Only thing I am not happy with is the gifs in the text messaging. Once I send them, gifs are blurry. Ones I receive from others are clear. Can't seem to get help to fix problem.  Contacted phone provider. They said just have to live with the Message app on phone. Some gifs are ok. Majority are blurry, so guess won't be sending many to my friends anymore.  Camera takes great photos. Love setting to take photo if lighting is dark.  It is only a little taller than my Samsung, but still fits in my small purse. And fit perfect in the wallet case I bought. So, happy so far.  Except for the lousy gifs."
3284,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"So far I really like this phone. It took me a bit to get used to using it and it is different than my last phone. It was fairly easy to set up and has plenty of storage for me. I have always had Tracfone as a cell phone carrier and have no issues with them so it didn't bother me to get a phone that was from them even though I bought it on Amazon. It got here a lot faster than it was scheduled to and that was really nice. I do put it on charge every night so I think the battery could be better, but other than that I find that I'm liking this phone."
3285,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"I got this phone because of the price for the features but I prefer my old phone despite this one being slightly more advanced. The finger recognition is in the WORST spot. Why put it on the on button? Every time I press it I end up unlocking my phone when I just want to see the time and it gets confused when I want to turn it off because it thinks I am trying to use my finger. It also comes on too often. I press the off button to turn it off and when it finally does it comes back on at the slightest touch. My old phone allowed you to double tap the screen in order to turn it on or off, but this one makes it stay off unless you press the dreaded power button. The battery life sucks. It charges way too slowly and drain fast. I just got this so this shouldn't be the case and my last phone lasted longer despite all the time I had it. I think the front camera could be better, but it is an android. The feature that tells the weather is not accurate by any means. The screenshot feature is not convenient and I am not sure what it's called but that feature that allows you to look at the recently used apps and swipe them is not convenient either. You have to be in another app to use and not not the home screen. Not sure why that is a thing. I could probably think of more things that annoy me about this, but all that was off the top of my head. It has good features like the audio, but it lacks so much that I had to focus on them."
3286,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,I absolutely love this upgrade for this phone. The battery life is lengthy. It was a great value for the money. Pictures and images are awesome
3287,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,Great phone at a great price! I bought 2 of them! For the money it is a Deal!
3288,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,So far I love this phone.  It was as always with tracfone super easy to set up and transfer service to the new device.  It copies over all my old information from my old phone with ease.  It took less than 15 minutes for service to switch over and start working.  For me so far the best feature is how easy it is to take clear pictures.  The last 2 phones I had through tracfone (none have been moto) it was a pain to get clear pictures of my cats.  This phone I takes great pictures even with small movements from both me and the cats.  Such a relief.  I have had slight adjustment to the stylus as I have never used one with a cell phone before so thats not the best in the world but that is not the feature I bought the phone for.  The pictures and the internal memory are the important parts for me as I don't like dealing with external memory so the 128GB is a life saver.  There was not as much bloat ware on this one as on the last phone I had but I still went through and deleted a bunch of the extras before setting my stuff up.
3289,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"I have this same phone only mine is a 2020, while this is a 2021. This phone is a little larger than mine, which caught us off guard. The battery has super long life. The camera is so crisp! It took quite a bit of a beating when my daughter first got it, which is amazing because it should have been demolished. Now to go buy the case and screen protectors!!"
3290,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,EstÃ¡ buenÃ­simo
3291,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,The only issue I have with this phone is once you put a case on it.( Have tried two different ones) the power/ fingerprint sensor because so shallow most times you can't get it to.pick up your print corectly
3292,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,Playing games
3293,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,good phone especially at $94.00. On prime day.  Highly recommended if found under $200.00
3294,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"I love my phone! It's got plenty of space for my apps and videos. The battery life isn't the best. I charge it up all night and in the morning (6am) it's 100%. I check email, do a little Google News reading, play a game for about 45 minutes and then it's in need of a charge at like 28% so definitely could use a better battery. But it's processor is pretty fast and switches between apps without issues (no freezing etc). ButI charge my phone about 2-3 times a day. It does charge pretty quickly. It's got a 'rapid charging' so that's a plus.. I do love the phone and would definitely buy it again!!!"
3295,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"This phone is exactly what you'd expect in this price range, good storage, camera, and battery life with some very nice features and a big screen."
3296,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"I love this phone.  I would give it a 5 if the battery life wasn't so horrible.  The camera is amazing.  The set up was easy (from a Moto G Optimo Maxx which i unfortunately drowned!).  This phone is very large.  Was a little concerned at first but I do like it now.  I have taken to shutting off at night and still battery life is short.  Very disappointed in that for sure.  My Moto g maxx had much longer life. I won't return the phone because it really is a great phone.Update:  After researching what to delete, change etc.  battery life is much better.  Much happier."
3297,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,So far really good product battery runs out fast but still learning the settings. But Love the size of screen and storage space.and the stylus is wonderful I have to say that I'm glad what I heard about Motorola g stylus was wrong. I have no regrets with it other than battery. Oh and it does get a little Hot when I play my game over an hour. But it good for us older people who need a little bit more screen.
3298,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,Great resolution. Fantastic camera. Huge storage. But you need a battery bank in your pocket at all  times. And the battery life is seems to get worse every day. Almost...
3299,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"Like many have said, the battery life on this phone is less than desired but it is a nice phone.  It was a little hard to transfer texts with their pictures attached but I found a program via YouTube that did the trick.  I was transferring from a Galaxy phone to this Motorola Moto G Stylus via Google and the pictures didn't accompany the texts.  It took awhile to figure a way.  Other than that, this phone has been nice."
3300,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"Overall, a nice phone. It malfunctions more than I like. When it's all working, less frequent than when it's not, it's a really good phone. But, it could be a lot better with some fixes to the phone and text app included. My phone will not recognize that it's been pulled away from my face and stays blanked. I'd say 90/95% of the all calls this happens. It makes in call menu/number selection(s) a huge pain. I press power button to illuminate and must press a keypad menu/number at the same time, or the screen blanks back out. It's annoying and less functional than the phone it replaced. Text app sends 1 out of 3, or 4, on the first try. What? My 2000 Nokia had a better send rate than that. It's always with the ""message not sent"", ""waiting for connection"" notification. I get that reception will vary on texts but, this again, is less functional than what it replaced and is on the same network connection. Camera quality is a whole other thread topic. Not bad, but not that good in certain light/environmental conditions."
3301,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"I love my new phone and it worked because it was locked into my carrier.  The only problem I'm having is with the google assistant I can't seem to get it to work for me how I want it to will keep trying to get it to work for me, but otherwise it's a great phone."
3302,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,It is easier for me to see details on the screen
3303,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"l always got Samsung android phones until they put Bixby on there, which I don't like and it takes up a lot of space. So l got my first Moto and now this one which is a little bigger, has more space and a built in stylus. Also l am writing this on my phone screen in cursive with my finger. Pretty cool huh? And it cost so much less than my Samsungs, I will have Moto from now on!"
3304,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,Great Phone.. Absolutely satisfied with my purchase...Delivery was well before it's due day. Well package..!!
3305,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"This is a great phone.  It has so many features, it will take me some time to experience many of them.  The capacity of 128GB is fantastic, now I have room for lots of apps as well as stored data.  Getting it registered on my existing Tracfone account was a breeze, as was data transfer using Google."
3306,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"The box of my phone was sealed but after opening it I found that the phone is missing the stylus. I paid full price for an incomplete item and do not want to send this thing back as I've already set it up and connected it to my tracfone acct.**EDIT** After using Amazon's chat help function, I got a replacement phone for free. Don't have to send the original one back.The phone is a lot bigger than I suspected. Really long phone. The operation of it can take a little getting used to but it works well. Bright clear screen looks great"
3307,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"i'm a person that finds something I like and then hang to it. This phone does everything I need and cost doesn't break the bank. If I damage it, I can buy another one without sending an arm and a leg. It's got a big screen. I've got big hands and even I had trouble holding it until I got a protective case with a finger ring on the back. I'm rough on phones so this is prefect for me."
3308,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,This is a great phone for the money.  It takes awesome pictures.
3309,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"I've had this phone for about four months now and I'm very happy with it.  The storage is good although I don't have hundreds of pictures on it.  The phone is very clear, the pictures are good and it's very user friendly.  I've used the stylus on occasions and it works well.  I'm sure there are many other features that I haven't even used yet.  I like that you can ask the Moto assistant questions and the answers pop up rather  quickly.  It's also helpful when you don't have time to type something in.I highly recommend this phone."

3311,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"This phone is a great value for the money. It takes GREAT pictures, and is a perfect size. The step by step tutorial on how to use it is super easy. The fingerprint feature works great too. However, it says in the description that it is blue, but mine almost looks like a dark green. If not shined in the light is looks black. Other then that, its a great phone and the Tracfone plan I got is great!  10/10 recommend"
3312,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,Battery would never last as long as promised and has had some issues with screenshots tooğŸ¤”
3313,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,It was my cell phone it was different I was use to Samsung Galaxy the moto was hard to get used to
3314,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"Fast. great for taking pics and having lots of apps.  Bought it for my daughter at work.  Her phone essentially serves her for everything and she loves it!  the blue color is over-the-top beautiful.  She added a clear case and a beach pop socket.  So nice, works wonderful.  Total value for a reasonable phone!"
3315,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"Lots of space (128GB). Super fast, love stylus.  There are quite a few pre loaded apps that I'll never use is the only thing I don't like. After adding my apps, I still have tons of space. I don't think I will have to use a sd card at all. This is my first Moto and I love it. Transferring from my old phone was very easy. No problem"
3316,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,Works great! It has a headphone jack which is very important to me. Battery is great! Lasts a day with 30% extra typically.  Photos look pretty good. I really like this! Switched from a Samsung... Much better!
3317,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,I really don't think you could find a better phone for the price . only had it for a few days but it freaking nice $129.00. I have seen phones in that price range and they are junk. Its a tracphone so for $27.00 a month unlimited talk & Text with 3 gb of data. And its verizon towers. Im good !
3318,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,The camera is worse than my iPhone 7
3319,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"Haven't had this phone for very long, but it seems to be fairly standard. Appreciate the 128gb. However, battery life is dismal, about 9 hrs with light use. Camera quality certainly seems to be above that of the Moto G Power, which was terrible. Will update."
3320,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,I got this phone because my friend Bwandon got on.  My fiend Bwandon gets lots of phones because he breaks them all the time.  My friend Bwandon showed me how things work.  I will take pictures of my friend Bwandon's mom with it.
3321,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,When I first activated my phone it wouldn't work. The next day it started to work better. Battery life is 2 hrs. Instead of days.
3322,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"Friend of mine cracked her screen, so ordered herself this phone. She is happy with the purchase, received it quickly!"
3323,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"Bought this for my mom. She loves it! Expandable memory, great camera and the tactile feedback is excellent."
3324,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,Very happy with phone A+
3325,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"Love this phone, had a Moto G6 which was getting too slow and running out of memory. Replaced it with this one. This is so much faster and has a lot of memory, (128 GB I believe) Love Motorola phones."
3326,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"Have been trying over 2 weeks to log on to Tracfone ""My Account"" and even the customer service techs with Tracfone have been unable to do it . Tracfone is being taken over by Verizon. Tracfone said the problem we all have been having with Tracfone site is due to system upgrade, maintenance, and (most likely) being absorbed by Verizon. Tracfone says service plan costs will not change ""right now"".  If you do not wish to have Verizon or have to pay their plan cost, which is higher than Tracfone, I need to notify you to not get Tracfone, atleast until you've talked with them directly. Due to these ongoing issues and my inability to get into my account, am returning this phone. IF you don't want Verizon, don't get this phone. And don't get Tracfone. Agree with all the others...their system is messed up and you get no help"
3327,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"I was drawn to this phone based on the price and features, including the larger screen. Getting my plan switched over was not too difficult, but then the problems began. About half of the files transferred over became corrupt, making me have to delete them and try again, sometimes multiple times. Pictures taken would occasionally suffer the same problem too. The best I can tell is the storage for the device is the problem. I used to be a fan of Motorola after seeing what the horrific damage a Moto E could suffer and still manage to activate enough to recover the data (it was folded 90-degrees in a car crash). Now, I am leery about getting another Motorola phone. Further cementing in my mind of avoidance is the battery. The advert touted a long multi-day battery life but it had used up 10% of the battery in a very short period of time. My older LG Aristo does not consume the battery as quickly, even after some five years of use. As cool as an idea this phone is, the sample I got as a lesson in poorer quality control to cuts costs."
3328,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,Great camera and I like the stylus and note app.
3329,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,Phone quality is considerably decrease from prior Motorola models. Slow charging. Websites hang or freeze. Bluetooth is unreliable. I should have purchased the 5G version.
3330,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"Loved the phone despite the short battery life... But have had difficulties with getting it to charge- tried several charging cords, including a brand new one and then last night shut down without any warning. It's dead after only 6 months -VERY upset. Will never buy another Motorola."
3331,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,"UNPREDICTABLE,, UNRELIABLE AND UNUSABLE"
3332,TracFone,Moto g Stylus,128 GB,Android,6.8 Inches,it will not pick up wifi or data most places. useless
3333,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Phone was, in excellent condition and updated to the latest OS which saved a bunch of time. No marks, battery appears fine, and everything works. Could not be happier. As stated, it did not come with the 18W Power Delivery charger (had a cheap Samsung type) or the audio and transfer cables. No big deal since I already have all that stuff. This was cheaper than a new battery in the phone I am replacing."
3334,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Update to below review -I'm updating the rating to 3 star:  although the seller doesnt work weekends - they did reach back on Sunday through an Amazon email**NOTE Amazon sends you all kinds of emails in your regular email but of course they dont send you important one's like a seller response - so you have to login into AMAzon to find if/when a seller responds (this is a DING against amazon).Getting back to the seller who i ended up speaking in person over the phone - she immediately sent me a shipping postage receipt to send back the default phone and has indicated once rec'd she will expedite the shipment of the replacement phone.. I voiced to her my concern if this replacement phone does the same thing even 6 months down the road and it sounds that she will back me up.I understand that i bought a renewed electronic (ive had them before- w/o major issues) and sometimes things may go awry, so for the customer service from the customer end i'm currently updating rating to a 3.  I will update review again based on the phone replacement but I will wait a few months to do so.Original review below__________________________I was LOVING this phone (great memory, battery life, light to hold, small, good sppeds, good pics) then LESS THEN 30 days of its purchase it STOPPED TURNING ON.. tried to reset.. its weekend and cant get a hold of seller (which is ludicrous), there is no damage to the phone ..  So i have reached out to the seller through Amazon and will see what happens.. I will update this review based upon the response.. so far being i have to wait 2 days for something like a cell phone.. which we is used daily and for business the 2 day wait for customer service on this is unacceptable.. I had good hopes and was optimistic at first but now I'm thinking i should have listened to the pessimistic side that you cant trust 3rd party sellershere's my msg sent thru amazon to the sellerI rec'd my pixel 4a 1/29/22.. today 2/26/22 it stopped turning on, there is no damage to the phone. I've tried taking out sim card, putting on charger nothing is working. I'm pretty upset that this is happening this was not a cheap purchase.. and now i'm very leary of your company . I need this fixed_replaced ASAP.  I'm willing to get a replacement ASAP but if this happens with the replacement I'm definitely asking for a refund even if it stops working 6 months out.. There is absolutely no reason why this should be happening on top of that being its Saturday no one at electronic wireless is answering the phone.. it says to send an email but no email address is given super upset.  I need to be contacted asap and this situation needs to be addressed ASAP with a replacement sent out and expedited"
3335,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"This phone was purchased as a replacement for my 4 year old Samsung Galaxy. It took a bit of getting used to in terms of the gestures and interface it uses, but I've had no problems with it and the battery life is miles ahead of what I had before. I can literally go more than a day without needing to put it on the charger."
3336,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"The phone is realy good for second phoneBest camera for this price, but it is used, so there is no effect of a new phone"
3337,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,simple mobile phone. compact size. Good battery life and Google's perfection is everywhere in phone. Different kind of android experience
3338,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"I only have had it for a couple of days, but battery life, camera, and the responsiveness of the softwares are working great. Hard to tell apart from another new phone"
3339,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Great fingerprint reader (that's why I sent back my new 6a after a week of horrible screen finger reader). Replacing my old 4a.
3340,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,The phone is OK but this seller chose to not include the Quick Switch Adapter that makes transfer of data from old phone to new phone easy. New Pixel phones all include this small item. I would have happily paid more to have this included & avoided some hours of problems & anxiety moving into my new phone.
3341,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"No complain, other than the battery... not bad though but should be better. However, this is a wonderful phone. The weight is what i love most. I will buy again if need for another arises"
3342,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,I am so pleased with this phone. Especially for the price. It is up to date with the current Android tech even though it is over 3 years old.
3343,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"I think most people can agree that the Pixel 4a is a decent phone. My beef is with this particular seller, ""bayshine Trading,"" listing the device condition as ""New"" and then sending phones that have noticeable, sometimes major, flaws in their hardware.The first one I received, in the ""barely blue"" color, had a large dead-zone in the touchscreen, making the phone very difficult to use, bordering on unusable. After returning that device and ordering another one, the new device, in the ""just black"" color, had no obvious flaws, other than a large build-up of what appeared to be dust in the front-facing camera. This turned out to significantly degrade the quality of selfies and severely inhibit applications that rely on it.With that said, the phone is largely usable, and $150 for a Pixel 4a is still quite good value-wise. I'm not sure if it's worth the hassle to return it at this point, given that I went ahead and activated it before noticing the issue with the front-facing camera, but I can certainly say I wish I'd gone with a different seller and avoided this mess to begin with."
3344,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"I bought the refurbished Pixel 4a back around December 2020.  It was about $35 less than brand new price.  I heard alot of good reviews as it being a great budget compact Android phone, the Apple competition was an IPhone SE 2020, but that was $150 more and less storage space.  Right out of the box I noticed there were noticeable scratches along the bottom rear of the phone.  It was probably only cosmetic damages and nothing to affect the performance, but being the OCD I am, I decided to return it and get a brand new one from a carrier since they were doing a $100 off promo.I've had the phone for about 8 months now and it's been a great phone, I have no problems. However, if I was going to get nit-picky, I'd say the phone has 1-2 second delays/hiccups occasionally.  I've learned to live with it, this is not a top of the line phone.  I don't play games on this phone so I can't say in the graphics hardware department, but YouTube has been great.  The battery life feels a bit lackluster as under moderate to heavy usage I have to recharge the phone at least twice a day, but this is understandable for a small compact size and price.  Overall I think it's a good phone for the pricePros:Great Price for what you getAmazing photos, amazing colors, and it has night photosCompact size!!  Alot of phones recently are getting larger than 6inches+.  I wanted something small I can leave in my pockets and not feel bulky all dayCons:Occasional lags, it's Very Very minor, but it's still thereFinger print reader requires a few triesMediocre battery life"
3345,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"For the low price I paid, I'm satisfied. Even though it's an older phone without the niche features that more expensive phones have, I don't mind. There's no facial recognition, no wireless charging, and it isn't water resistant. These are all gimmicky features that I don't mind missing out on. It's an excellent phone if you're coming from a Pixel 3a or similar phone."
3346,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"I do No gaming , I'm rarely on social media.  I had made only two -(Not over 2 minute videos). The battery never lasted only about  half of a day. The screen time displayed to charge the battery until full never worked right comparing it to my actual home clock. It was a refurbished phone .  The phone doesn't come with a user manual I saw a few things on information on the phone itself and I watched YouTube videos on tips & tricks on the phone so I figured out a few things about the Google Pixel 4 A phone so it is a mixed bag of ""good & bad"" for me I keep it charged but for anyone not being near a charging area or port it may NOT be a good phone to buy this phone."
3347,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Amazing bang for your buck and the camera for the price of this phone is unbeatable. Combine this with the Google-Fi plan and you've got a perfect travel companion to take with you around the world
3348,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"I've only had this phone for a couple days. I got it used but it said it was new. It's probably a little early to write a review and I typically wait some time before writing reviews so that I get a full feel for the quality. The battery life on this phone is atrocious.It was fully charged when I went to bed. When I woke up, it was at 96%. I started actually using it - the battery life went down so fast it was as if it were running away from something (from 96% to 74% in less than an hour with light usage)I put it on the charger. This is not a fast charge cable or a Google cable which historically charges pixels faster than other cables. This is just a run of the mill 10' data/charge cable and typically takes some time to get things charged.It's been plugged in for about a half hour and it's gained 20%What all of that tells me it's that it has a very small battery. I suggest getting a power bank along with this. Aside from the battery though, the phone is fine, average really. Not really excellent but not terrible."
3349,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"The OEM Unlocking feature was greyed out on the one I ordered for my husband.  So, we have to send it back.  Otherwise, the phone is clean and looks like new!  If you don't need the OEM Unlocking feature turned on (to unlock the bootloader) you should have no issues with this phone.  However, I don't like when I'm told something is unlocked and you find that it's not necessarily true."
3350,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"My major issues with the phone are related to network connectivity. The two days I tried to make it work, I drained my data usage because it kept dropping my wifi connection or it was INCREDIBLY slow when other devices on my wifi were fine. It also refused to reconnect to the data network after I lost service (driving through a canyon) and got it back again. Even restarting didn't help that issue. Besides connectivity, the phone arrived dirty. There was a pet hair lodged under the camera lens, dirt and grime in the ports (easy for me to blow out with canned air, but why wasn't such an easy clean up done by the seller/renewer??), and obvious markings where an old case had been."
3351,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Broke my original 4a that I bought from Google. Got this one from Amazon Refurbished. Good price & handset is in excellent condition. Works perfectly.
3352,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"I've had this phone for over 6 months now and I have relatively zero complaints. My family has always run on Moto (Motorola) phones but I when my three year old G5 started giving out on me, I decided to buy my next phone with my own money so I could get exactly what I want.My parents initially scoffed at my $400 phone (they've never spent more than $160 on a smartphone) but over the past year I've seen them grow more and more jealous. I'm the first to get every android update, sometimes months ahead of other phones. The camera is great, and I will never run out of storage. I'd like it if the battery lasted a little longer, but it's better than my last phone and I'm not to upset about it.I was anxious about getting a refurbished phone, but it was in perfect condition when I got it. I never would have been able to tell that it had been used before."
3353,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"My refurbished phone arrived in the original box, tape shut again, with a usb-c cable and wall charger along with the device. It had warranty information as well as some of the origninal documentation as well.The phone booted up no problem, activated with my SIM card, the cameras work (front and back) and the microphone and speakers both work, and it takes a charge. In terms of the device working out of the box everything looks good.However I'm a little concerned that my phone and the provided accessories had a heavy mildew smell to them, almost like a water container that's been left out for too long. The phone was pungent enough that I could smell the swampy smell from a couple of feet away while setting the device up. I'm hoping that this dissipates over time and also does not indicate water damage to a returned device that might be an issue down the line."
3354,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Really great refurbished phone that was guaranteed to work and so far, after 2 weeks, it is still working wonderfully."
3355,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Phone looks like it is new.  No visible scratches.  Battery life is good.  Everything works so far.
3356,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"The unit I received shows absolutly no sign of use. Battery seems good, and because this is not a waterproof model battery replacement might not be too hard.A note on battery life. Batteries fail, typically, after too many recharge cycles. So, if convenient, you should allow charge to fall to maybe 15% and then charge to 95%."
3357,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Received my phone yesterday, battery life is good so far.  Fingerprint reader is great and the phone is a good deal for the price."
3358,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"the phone was in decent shape, but the battery had some huge drain jumps, the wifi constantly disconnected (no problems with other devices), and oem unlocking would not work, which is my main reason for even buying these garbage pixel phones in the first place.the real nightmare? the return. seems like lately, the new fad is to send the phone to your house (as expected) and make you return it with ups drop-off. i have no drop-off site for miles, and miles and ups won't pick it up for free. maybe you can drive around town and flag down a truck. i'm so tired of this nonsense."
3359,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Marked renewed but it looked brand new. Not a mark or scuff and the screen is bright. Perfect renewal.
3360,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"For those times when I don't want to lug around one of my larger high-end phones I like to have a compact phone to use and I have missed my 4a since I traded so I bought this one on Amazon.I keep all of my phones pristine even the ones that are several years old so when I saw the Pixel 4a advertised as ""Like New"" I couldn't resist. It arrived today and it definitely doesn't look Like New as shown in the pictures. The back of the phone is covered with scratches and there is also a scrape on the top speaker grill so there is a silver scrape going through the black paint and there is also a dent in the trim next to the power button at the edge of the screen.I am in the process of setting it up now and will update my review later if I decide to keep it. If you are expecting a Like New phone, this is probably not the place to buy it especially at this price."
3361,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"I sure miss the back button. I've been using the back button since it was a real button, back in V1.3 I'm sure eventually I'll get used to swiping left, but at almost a month in, I still find myself hitting the imaginary back button that's not there anymore. Why did they take away my back button? Was it really taking up that much space? Change should add value. It should never just be, change for change's sake! Did I mention I miss my back button? Maybe they could make the back button an option in a future update... I can only hope."
3362,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,This is my second Pixel 4a. Great phone easy to set up and use. As advertised condition is great it is in excellent condition. If you are looking for a good phone this is it.
3363,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"The phone came with some minor scratches and wear that shows the previous owner did not use any protection. The charger cable did not work, had to buy another cable. Am not in the states and really needed a phone so I did not return it."
3364,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Got my order ahead of time and the phone was in excellent condition. I had a pixel 3 and went to the 4 and just love it. No issues with any hardware or software.  Finger print reader also works, and that was a worry for me. Love that I got this at the price I did and the battery life is 100x better than my last one."
3365,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Bought this phone to replace a one year old Pixel 4a (dropped overboard :(  ). It appears brand new and works great. Been using it for a week and no problems and great battery life (I can get 2 days from it if I'm not searching for a single). I would recommend it to anyone.
3366,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Received the refurbished Google Pixel 4a phone a couple of days delayed from the seller. Setup the phone and made a test phone call. The person on other end can hear me only when I was on speaker. There is no way to fix this issue and I am very disappointed.Also like another reviewer has mentioned, the phone in no way looks in excellent condition. I could see scratches and blemishes all over the back side of the phone that could be seen even if held far away. The front screen was ok though.But the mic issue I experienced renders it non functional for all practical purposes.Returning it.I trusted Amazon's refurbished excellent condition guarantee and believed that the products get tested and go through a thorough quality check. The fact that this phone has the mic that works only when I am on speaker mode tells me that they didn't even do a basic quality check. So the quality check they claim is only on paper, but not a real check. What a disappointment :-("
3367,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"I received the phone and when I turned it on there was a damaged in the screen. I sent it back immediately but I only got 50% of the money back. When I called Amazon customer service, they claimed this was issued by a third client and the only thing they could do was to write them an e-mail which resulted in nothing. I kept calling back for 3 months, but nothing was done. After 3 months they told me that the phone was no longer under warantee and that they coudn't do much.  Only after telling them that I was recording the call and that I needed the full name of the person talking, they changed their mind and refund me the full amount.I would not recomend buying second hand Amazon products that come from third sellers (which was not even specified in the item- this phone is). It will be likely that they are damaged and Amazon does not take the responsability for it."
3368,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"The charger that came with this renewed phone is NOT as advertised. It is 14.4 Watt instead of 18 Watt (which means your phone will charge 20% slower than it is supposed to unless you buy a 3rd party charger). Seller won't send the charger they advertised or discount the amount such a charger costs - poor service and false advertising. I will be leaving seller feedback for that.Despite the above, the Phone is fantastic. Battery life and screen great. Fingerprint scanner is snappy. No stuttering - google assistant call screening is amazing. Aside from the packaging, I couldn't tell it wasn't new."
3369,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,
3370,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Phone looks great and works great.
3371,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Everything was great about it, up until yesterday, when a couple blue splotches appeared on the screen. I got concerned but went to bed. I wake up, and check the phone, and it's screen is covered in dark blue spots! I have never once dropped it and it has a screen protector on it. Yet still it's developed damage!In all likelyhood it will be a brick in the next 24 hours. I do not recommend."
3372,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,My last Pixel decided to fry itself and I needed a quick replacement. This phone arrived the day after I ordered it! Worked perfectly fine setting up with T-mobile and runs great.
3373,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Love this phone! I know some reviews complained about the finger print scanner, but I found that my fingers just need to be dry. No prob after I figured that out. Before this phone I never liked them enough to keep them charged. I can't live without this phone. Now I'm like my kids, someone would have to kill me and pry it from my dead cold fingers."
3374,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"""Renewed"" and ""refurbished"" just mean someone else's return. I spent hours setting this d*mn phone up, only to ultimately discover that the camera wouldn't focus. You would think that the 'renewers' might have verified the camera's operation, given that it is one of the bigger selling points of this phone. Returning it for an identical exchange, and will review the exchange phone when it arrives."
3375,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"I don't know who programs the OS for these things but this phone -- the Google Pixel 4a --  has so many useless features it's impossible to itemize them all.It's as if 50 teenage programmers were sitting in cubicles all day for 5 years and they had absolutely nothing to do but smoke weed and write stupid useless, code that no sane person needs.So buy this phone if you want to wade through endless menus with endless meaningless, overly-differentiated choices.  Buy this phone if you want pop-ups thrown in your face every 5 minutes to ""alert"" you to something you could care less about.  Buy this phone if you want to get lost in a wilderness of complexity and menu design that is as far away from intuitive as it could be.This phone sucks and the manufacturers of phones like this -- basically the Android OS -- need to get a life and start making phones that actual human beings can use.  Not technical monstrosities that are desperately trying to ""prove"" they are ""smart.""P.S. My first review of this phone was actually rejected by Amazon's minions.  This is therefore a watered-down review as the Google Pixel 4a is so bad it can't be described without a few expletives.  So thanks for censoring my review Amazon.  Because of your stupid ""community standards.""  I will now include you in my review as an apologist for the horrible Google ""dumbphone"" you see fit to sell."
3376,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"First off, it was promised by Friday but arrived Wednesday. The seller shipped it out the day I ordered it. I have been without a phone for several days so it's quite a relief to get it so soon.The phone is very high quality. Probably the best phone I've ever used. Setup took 10 minutes and was very easy to accomplish.Despite being ""renewed,"" the phone basically feels like it's brand new. It runs perfectly, and there aren't even any scratches or dents anywhere on the device. The seller did a phenomenal job of restoring this device."
3377,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,I'm told this is a hardware issue. There is no option in settings for fingerprint reader. It exists on the phone body but no functional option.Very disappointed.
3378,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,OK. This is a refurb phone. Pixel 4a. I paid less for it but the headphone jack doesn't work and the operating system is sluggish. I am using Google Fi as my cell phone provider at $20 per month (so new to it that my 1st bill isn't due yet) and it has dropped ONE call over 22 min while driving so far. Short 10 min calls are fine. I think I should have bought a brand new Pixel 3 after this experience. I bought a Bluetooth headset to bypass the headphone jack. This has better coverage than my former T-Mobile so I will deal with these 1st world problems rather than send it back.
3379,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"One star for getting the damaged product to me quickly!The description stated that the phone is in excellent condition. Amazon defines excellent condition as, ""Cosmetic condition: Excellent (Screen: no scratches. Body: no signs of cosmetic damage (scratches, dents, etc.) will be visible when the product is held 12 inches away).""Well I can see damage to the exterior of the phone when it is more than 12 inches away. It appears that the phone was dropped onto concrete and landed on the top and bottom of the phone. I guess no case was used by the previous owner?!?If the exterior has this kind of damage, it makes me wonder what condition the interior components are in."
3380,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Camera lens was badly scratched even after they mentioned it â€œlike newâ€. Scratches were visible very clear
3381,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,I got this for my son and he was really happy about this one. Long battery life. Great camera ans reasonably snappy. He is also a MTB and BMX biker  and rough on phones. Uses the phone for tons of action videos. Really no complains and my daughters iPhone 11 is not that much better camera wise.  No crap software and adware. and when we where  hiking it was the only one that had a signal. Plus this thing still has a headphone jack.  I also got the renewed so even had more discount. This is one of those cases where you get more than you paid for.
3382,Google,Pixel 4a,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Delivered on time as expected overall phone working well only one issue that really matter which is the phone screen is lifted up on the bottom.
3383,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Full disclosure: I think of a mobile phone as a commodity and buy accordingly. If you think you need a $1200 phone with a 48MP camera to take pictures of your cats, good for you; I do not. That said, I do expect a basic level of functionality regardless of price. In that regard, this phone fails on several fronts.First, the face recognition is useless. It does work, but it drains the battery so much that it reduces battery life by over 50%.Second, the fingerprint reader on the side power button must be the most stupid design ever. Even with the fingerprint set to ""light pressure"" by the time you apply enough pressure to have your fingerprint read, you have also triggered the power button. So the phone flashes on from the fingerprint unlock, then locks immediately from the power button.Third, the screen will not stay on. I have the screen set to shut off after two minutes. This setting is often completely ignored and the phone goes dim at 15 seconds, then off fully at 20 seconds. I do not have any power saving settings enabled. It does not happen all the time and does not always happen at 15 seconds. but it never makes it to the 2 minute mark. I just tried it now and it shut off at 48 seconds.That said, the battery life is pretty good as I only have to charge it every few days. The voice quality is good as is the speakerphone. It seems to be rather durable having been dropped a couple of times from waist height onto a hardwood floor with no cracking of the screen. The glass does etch very easily though.It's 5G, but I don't care. I'm on wi-fi most of the time for data and 5G offers no improvements over 4G/VoLTE for voice calls.All considered, I'll stick with my $100 price-point phones, use them up, and then get a new one."
3384,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I purchased this phone to use as my second device. Honestly, for the money it has not disappointed me. When purchasing phones at this price point, there is always a little give and take when it comes to performance and features. However, I do think OnePlus has struck a nice balance with this model.When I unboxed it the first thing that struck me was the build quality. This absolutely maintains the form factor of their more expensive devices. My primary phone is a OnePlus 8T and this is definitely reminiscent of that.As far as the features and performance is concerned, everything works as it is supposed to. I am actually very impressed by the side mounted fingerprint sensor which doubles as the power button. It works quickly and efficiently and I really feel that even they're more expensive devices should have this feature. In addition, the screen resolution and viewing angles are very sharp and the phones battery power is amazing. I am also very impressed with the single firing speaker at the bottom of the device. A lot of companies tend to cheap out on their speakers when it comes to their more affordable devices. Fortunately, the sound is crisp and clear and definitely not tinny.Connectivity has definitely not been a problem since I purchased the phone. I am not only getting 4G LTE connections but, 5G is connecting exactly how it should. Although, when it comes to factory unlocked OnePlus devices 5G is only capable on the T-Mobile network and it's other carriers such as Metro by t-mobile, mint mobile and many others. Thus, don't expect to get 5G on networks like AT&t, Verizon and their subsidiaries because, it will not happen.Oneplus decided to equip this phone with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G processor which is rated at 2.0 GHz per second. They also equipped the phone with 4 GB of RAM. The best way to describe the processing performance is steady and reliable. It is not the fastest processor in the world but, it will get the job done. After all, this is a $240 phone and not one of their $1,000 models. Frankly, you cannot expect flagship performance like you would get with the Snapdragon 865 chipset or the Snapdragon 888. Again, it is not the fastest processor in the world but, it is not the slowest by far. You will have absolutely no problems performing day-to-day tasks, streaming movies and even gaming to a degree. Moreover, the 90 Hertz screen refresh rate definitely compensates for a lot of this.Understand, I am reading this device for what it is and not based on what it's not. If you are looking for a reliable good looking smartphone and you don't want to pay a lot of money then this is really the device you want. I have used it for about a month now and I am very happy with it. I would definitely not hesitate to recommend it."
3385,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"While this phone is fast switching from task to task it has froze on me. I had to restart the phone to un freeze. I've had this phone about 4 months and I do need to charge it every night. It charges up fast, but the more apps I download the more the battery deletes. Each app I download I restrict battery usage.I use my phone for games and social media, I am not on it constantly.Overall, I would buy this phone but not for $150 or $180. Don't remember exact price, but with warranty, close to $200."
3386,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Needed a new camera and saw this new model, figured the specs shows average reviews, but seemed good with the latest chipset and OS.  It boggs down a bit when running a few apps, and when opening an app seems like it takes a few seconds longer then my old phone.  I had a Ulefone 9E, older but battery was a bit better on that one and apps opened a lot faster."
3387,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I am a bottom feeder. I like to get a lot for a little $. When I saw the price and what this phone does and what is packed in this phone, there was some doubt that it was that good. Sometimes 'cheap' phones are actually cheap but also lack function and are disappointing. This ONEPLUS N200 5G - actually delivers.The N200 looks good. The screen is bright and responds fast. The fingerprint reader is positioned a little higher than I like but not enough to make it not pleasing to use. If you do not like to use fingerprint then use the face recognition. The N200 is very fast. The size of the phone is large but it is slightly a little narrow. This makes for fitting in a hand comfortable. The back is plastic but then a phone case will protect it.It is Android with what ONEPLUS calls 'Oxygen'. This means a few 'bells and whistles' make the phone fun to use. If you used Samsung or Motorola there is a very little learning curve.I purchased this phone based upon Amazon's return policy. If i did not like the phone then I would return it and get something I do like. This phone is a keeper. I like it. I like it a lot!I read many reviews about this phone and almost everything about this phone was favorable except the camera. I was very skeptical about the picture quality. After using the camera and being critical I decided it is not that bad. I compared the photos to the new Apple iPhone SE 5G (2022). Yes the iPhone had better quality photos but not by much. The iPhone costs twice the price of the N200. The photos in the N200 are better than Motorola G7 Plus phone. The N200 phone is acceptable for photos in my opinion.One thing you cannot beat is the price of this phone."
3388,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Cameras are nothing to write home about but are serviceable in good lighting. I picked this up as my primary phone after I gave my OnePlus 9 Pro to my GF after she destroyed her phone.Top reasons for my pick on this one:3.5mm headphone jackMicroSD card support (I have a 1TB in mine currently, loaded with music, ROMs, and a few movies when traveling)The underrated Snapdragon 480 (PS2 emulation is possible, lighter titles only)The size and feel in hand is superb in comparison to others in this weight class.Top criticisms I have:Cameras are lacking in finer details, noisy in lowlightPlastic back will pick up scratches easily - a case is highly recommendedThe fingerprint reader is temperamental at timesOverall, this is a solid and affordable option for those not wanting to plop down $1k or more for a phone that will easily do 95% what a flagship can. The Nord N200 5G will have 95% of the performance of flagships in your daily use (social media, web browsing, listening to music/watching movies). Surprising to me, shortly after setup and installing some emulators, this thing will run PS2 and GameCube games rather well (and beyond my expectations in most cases), anything older, aside from Sega Saturn is flawless. Not the gaming phone I had expected, but it definitely was a welcome bonus to the land of phones lacking 3.5mm audio and microSD support (seriously, Sony is the only flagship maker still putting this out). Pick up a good controller (such as a Razer Kishi, or an 8bitdo) and get some classic gaming in while on a plane or subway.This is a solid recommend if you don't require flagship specs and flagship pricing."
3389,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,Piece of crap. Cant use it for making calls cause they forgot to put an antenna in it. Drops calls faster than it connects. Sent it back and got a refund. Don't buy!!!!!
3390,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"It's pretty big. I don't use facial recognition because there's really no need for it and it's stupid anyway. Fingerprint sensor is pretty good. The camera leaves a lot to be desired especially if your coming off of an iphone but I knew that going in. I wanted to get a Google phone but too expensive. So I settled on this. It's pretty good, charges quickly. And it looks really nice just out of the box. I was tired of Samsung budget series wannabe S series. The last two I had were glitchy as hell. And Unless you wanna spend at least 300 on a better model Motorola I feel like they are right in the same category as the those Samsung phones. The last one I had was really crappy. So if don't wanna spend hundreds on a new ugly 49 camera lenses iPhone and your sick of Samsung and Motorola, I'd  say go ahead and get this. There are better phones probably. But not many as fast as this one for the same amount of money. Overall I'm happy with the purchase after having had it for a couple of months."
3391,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I bought this phone to replace the hand-me-down my son had been using. It's our second OnePlus phone and both have been great. This model is 5G and has massive battery capacity. Even with all the socializing and gaming he does (after all his homework in done, of course! ;) ) the battery is usually still above 40% at the end of the day. Great features, snappy performance, and excellent battery life."
3392,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,Little slow. Google assistant doesn't launch many time. Okay for the price to get a 5g phone.
3393,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I've lost count of the mobile phones I've owned over the past 20 years and this model is clearly the best in every way. The price/performance ratio is unbeatable. The only weakness of this phone is the ability to use a finger print to unlock, but since the face unlock works so well the finger print issue is irrelevant for me.  Taking pictures and videos are intuitive and pretty much fool proof. Navigation is simple and easy. Speakerphone is excellent."
3394,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"This is the best 5G phone for subpar -$500 or less budget market. The interface offers fast, buttery operations with above average somewhere north of 60 GHz exchange rate from the middling cpu, 6.4"" screen and massive battery that easily lasted a day and a half of moderate use with very good multitask (apps) performance from supposedly top-notched hardwares, at least  on paper. The latest Nord iteration also ups the ante on aesthetic with a sleek, smooth composite profile especially the back cover, giving it a premium feel. 5G experience on T-MOBILE was noticably better than LTE though not a fast pronounced as than the one on Verizon. The camera takes great photos outdoors and marginal indoor shoots with poor mode or those with little light. Finally, the price is right at around $250 (I nabbed it for $199 during a short promo), making it not just the cheapest 5G set but best budget phone of the year hands down over comparable rivals that I've owned or used like Moto G power and Samsung budget A-series."
3395,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I purchased this phone as second phone.  I have a OnePlus 10 pro 5g and needed a 5g phone for second phone.  The Nord line is a good value, not too of the line but reasonable downgrades. I like how it does 5g on my Mint/T-Mobile network easily.  The OS is different but the UI is not bad.  I would not recommend this for use with AT&T but good with T-Mobile and Verizon.  It has both 2.4 and 5 WiFi.  Chipset is reasonably responsive.  Camera average.  I picked this over a Samsung Galaxy A53."
3396,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Nice phone, great price, but uploading data from previous phone, an older Motorola brand was difficult.  Finally got everything loaded, but had to seek out help to get contacts and texts uploaded to new phone."
3397,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,Works great.  Very happy with it.  Combined it with Tello wireless plan for $10/month for unlimited calling and texting and am ready to ditch the landline.
3398,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I was happy with my oneplus 5T, but it was starting to get a bit unreliable. I was looking for an excuse to upgrade to a 5g phone, and this seemed like a good deal. I was familiar with the companies work on budget phones before and decided, what the heck!BOY WAS I WRONG... Sort ofThis phone is good enough for me not to return it. That's. It.It is NOT good enough for me to not have an issue with it.It's a short list for me but heavy hitting in my assessment.Start with the positives,The screen is real nice, I was a bit worried with it not being oled, but it looks good very clean. Not too reflective in sunlight, and the blacks are black.I appreciate the headphone jack and that was big in my decision for searching for a phone.NegativesTyping on this... Takes some getting used to, if you use typing vibrations they make the whole experience feel mushy, almost as if the vibration motor isn't at full power, short vibrations very weak and not ""buzzy"".The camera on this thing is a piece of work,The system is built in with image beautification that is a huge pain in the butt. In the camera app you can turn it off and manage to get an, ""on par"" picture you'd be expecting.However, if you use any apps that use a camera ie. Snapchat, tough luck, not setting for you.I am extremely dissatisfied with the camera.All this being said, I think to myself. ""you just bought this phone for $210, in 2022, shut up""Only taking price into consideration, it's an ok deal, especially if you don't use the camera.Taking into consideration OnePlus's history with challenging what can be done in a budget device... Kinda feels like I'm settling with this one.If i was still looking for phone, I'd pass this one up."
3399,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"This phone comes with a 5G supported snapdragon chipset (400 series) and also shipped with a 5000mAh battery. I do understand that this is a budget phone but it does not do justice to its battery capacity.Firstly, if you just want an android phone 5G supported and with a large screen, this phone fits the requirement well. It has a 90Hz refresh rate screen and its max brightness is manageable in Arizona summer days. Has a fingerprint sensor on the unlock button. For day to day purposes, this phone can get most of the stuff done such as calls and emails. Light gaming can be done too but don't expect this to run heavy games like Genshin Impact (runs at 10 fps).The cameras are not good at all. Does not even take good quality photos even with ample light and the night mode is pretty non existent. It's portrait mode shots are much worser than that of the main camera. (Am I expecting too much from buget phones these days? Samsung buget segment can take better photos).Finally the battery: Initially it was great, lasted two whole days with 60 Hz and lasted a whole day with 15% left in the beginning of the following day with 90Hz mode. After about 5 months, it barely stays alive for a whole day with 60Hz screen running and if enable power saver mode, it lasts a couple more hours. (I am a light user btw).I would probably go with samsung for the budget segment, or if you can squeeze out some more during the black friday season, you probably can go for the pixel 6a phones."
3400,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"This is far and away the worst cellphone i have ever paid for; i was forced to buy a 5g phone due to carrier nonsense. The memory amount is low, and the ""swap"" is too aggressive. if i get a text message while in an app like twitter or whatever, when i come back to twitter it needs to reload everything, because android swaps out the twitter stuff to display the SMS interface. It does this for every app. In a messaging app and click a link? after you close out the browser it needs to reload the messaging app. This makes using this phone a tedious nightmare for anything beyond ""texting"".The screen is either too dim or way too bright, everything in the middle is ""almost too dim"" and ""almost too bright"" with no ""perfect"" setting. The automatic dimming function is hot garbage. The screen itself is pretty low quality, compared to other $200-$250 phones.The cameras may as well not even be there. While they're better than the flip phone era cameras, the image quality this phone outputs is embarrassing. So i have to carry two phones or a phone and a camera to be able to freely take decent pictures anywhere, like i am used to.The battery life is pretty atrocious. I think this is partially due to the screen being low quality and often too bright, and the ""disk"" / storage writes to swap out apps due to low memory. It also requires a *different* type of charger than every other phone on the market. You have QC or IQ or PD chargers already? Well no fast charging on the Oneplus Nord N200 5g. 1% every two minutes. They use DASH or WARP or something. It isn't worth paying extra for a car charger and a charger ""for the office"" - which you will wish you had, because this battery isn't lasting all day, that's for sure.The gyroscopic sensors are bad. Every time i unlock the phone it ""quickly"" switches from portrait to landscape back to portrait, no matter how i hold it while unlocking. I put quickly in quotes because this whole thing takes about 4-5 seconds to settle on portrait mode. Every time i unlock it.Bluetooth always requires fiddling - It will connect to, for instance, a car stereo. Then Disconnect. Then you have to go into bluetooth settings and manually click the car's bluetooth name. Then it might work, about 60% of the time. This is another few minutes a few times a day wasted waiting on this phone.I cannot figure out where the $200-$235 i spent on this phone actually went. Every feature is poor. This phone costs me about 20-30 minutes *every day* in waiting for it to do stuff that phones have been doing for 12 years without any issues.I will say, and the reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1, that the phone call quality is decent, and the speaker is passable. 5g doesn't seem any faster than 4g, but that's a carrier thing, probably. I haven't tested this on other carriers, so it is possible that the modem inside is faster than an LTE modem, but i really doubt it. It's probably the same CAT level as bargain basement LTE phones have.Just stay away from this phone, unless you just need the phone app and a messaging/SMS app. it's ""ok"" at both of those things."
3401,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Note: Will not send texts via Verizon/TracFone.Nice clean Android with very little frou-frou.  Works fine on the right networks. The camera isn't horrible, but would be great if it was better. I have trouble with the fingerprint reader and have to keep my thumbnail short for it to work, but that is probably just me. The battery life is good."
3402,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Just about a month and a half old and so far so good. I was expecting the battery to be better.

3403,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,Good value for the price.Would have liked a finger print scanner on the back for the index finger like the OnePlus5.Would have preferred just one quality camera instead of three so-so camsHeadphone jack is back!
3404,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"For the price great phone. It was just a bit tat slow for my wife. She yelled at me for taking too long to send her driving directions to her phone. When in reality my phone was just ""slow"" to her flagship Pixel 5 standards to open up Google maps. I like the phone. The one complain will be the front facing camera hole. Around that area there's a shadow like smudge. I've seen it on display models at BestBuy too. I think it's just a poor quality panel that OnePlus just on the phone. But I mean for the price you can't really complain its really a good phone."
3405,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"This is a great phone for the price.  It is very frustrating how the manufacturers have convinced everyone that good phones cost $1200 and if you have to settle, then spend $500 on a discount phone.  Nonsense.  For people making 5 videos a day, editing the videos and posting on YouTube or tiktok, or people who spend 6 hours a day playing very graphics intensive games, maybe a flagship phone is useful.  But there are huge numbers of people who just want a phone to make calls (imagine!), text with people, get directions in Google maps or Waze, use some other apps like Uber, banking, etc.  This phone is way more than great for that.  It has a very nice screen, looks great, works smoothly and quickly on apps, makes calls well . . . Everything non-power users use a phone for.  I highly recommend it."
3406,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"My prior phone, a Google Pixel 3, had been entering an infinite boot loop due to an overly sensitive power button, so I thought I would give the OnePlus brand a try. The Nord 200 fell nicely into my desired price range, and although it wasn't important to me, it also had 5G.I generally have found that when going from a 3+ year old phone to newer one, the performance has increased. Not so with the Nord 200 (released in June 2021). On paper, the specs seemed to lean in favor of the OnePlus, if slightly. However, after unboxing and installing my software, I found the UI to be sluggish at the best of times. It's downright frustrating at others.Bottom line: I didn't do my homework, and I didn't realize how spoiled I was with the Pixel 3. As a budget phone, this is probably good enough, but I feel if I had spent another $60 on the OnePlus N10, I would have been happier. PC Mag feels this is one of the best low-budget phone on the market. Maybe. I have a couple days to decide if I'm keeping it or returning it; I haven't decided.My Geekbench results: Single-core 481, Multi-core 1271."
3407,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,Battery life is wonderful it's 5g and has a decent fingerprint reader and a 90hz refresh rate good for gaming and is a very reasonable price camera is pretty decent if you are good at taking pictures good picture will be taken if your not then it won't take good pictures and won't be helped by the software as much as other phones but I rate this thing highly much better then my old Samsung note s8 and s7 edge and s5active also the back of the phone feels odly nice
3408,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"The cellphone was large and heavier than expected. So I didn't even turn it on. I returned it immediately. The seller didn't have a valid return tracking with UPS. Since 7-22-2022, the return wasn't processed."
3409,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"This phone is an excellent value for what you need in a mobile device. It does not have all the high end specs, but it does what those specs would otherwise do very well. Canâ€™t go wrong with this buyâ€¦â€¦."

3411,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Phone is snappy in menus but slows down when starting and ending calls, this includes whatsapp or messenger calls.  It seems when connecting any type of call the added network load is a bit too much for the processing units. Other than this very minor annoyance, One+ seem to think It's OK for them to not allow you to turn their own advertisement and app notifications, so basically you can turn off any other app notifications except the One+ apps.Phone was purchased for a pre-teen and the quality, speed, battery life to price ratio is great. Overall it's a quality device and does exactly what we needed it to do.  We are able to overlook the annoyances."

I had to replace my one-year-old Redmi Note 9 Pro phone because of the 5G transition required by the ISPs.  I LOVED the Redmi. I do not love--or even like a lot--the Nord OnePlus.The screen is dark:  to bring the light up to the level needed to illuminate the data/apps, particularly when using it outside, it drains the battery rather quickly.The quick app menu icons (e.g., to take screenshots) are ridiculously large, very asthetically DISpleasing. There is no way to make them smaller other than installing a brand-new app loader.The camera app they had preinstalled was demanding I give it access to contacts, phone numbers, etc. No, thank you!  I replaced the app with another one from GooglePlay, which, btw, is superior in its photo features and quality.Constant nagging from Nord to ""finish setting up"" the phone--which actually means insisting I join their ""community"".  No, Thank you!Slow charging. Not the super-fast speed they claim."
3413,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I like the camera on this phone it takes nice clear photo's and the battery is long life and fast charging. I ended up paying too much for it though when I could have got it at my Metro PCS store for 120.00 set up, I ended up paying over 300.00 with it being switched and a case. Next time I'm going to look at the store before I go and order one. The only problem with this phone is that during call's sometimes the speaker phone will not work on the first try."
3414,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,need a phone with more options
3415,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Purchased this to migrate from a deteriorating level of Verizon service at my home. I had been informed by a neighbor the local T-Mobile service could actually provide a usable signal without racing outdoors. Good decision.Although the motivation was network performance, the phone itself is a good choice for those who don't need 'flagship' features on their phone. The phone is thin, lightweight with good resolution and adequate battery life. Overall, I'm a happy camper. Would buy again. Would recommend to family or friends who don't have 'extraordinary' expectations."
3416,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I got this as a temp replacement when my pixel bricked itself updating. I figured yeah it's a little cheaper but whatever how bad could it be? BAD. The fast charging feature is either a fake selling point or I got a dud. Even brand new it took all night to fully charge, I now have to have it plugged in pretty much everywhere I go, or it'll die. It's only about 7 months old. Having 5G doesn't really count for much when the phone itself is slow. VERY slow, takes about a second or two to respond when opening apps or going thru different screens, frequently ending up clicking things you didn't want too because it took so long to load. The cameras might be a decent mp number but it doesn't look like it, always a little blurry and washed out. Overall this phone works as if it was made and released ten years ago. I'd never recommend it."
3417,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,This phone is better than Apple in every way. The camera is better the speed is better and everything people who review this phone does NOT know what they are talking about. With my iPhone 11 pro Max I would get so many typos it was ridiculous but with this phone not so many typos only time I would get typos if I accidently pushed the wrong button cause my hands are too big. The camera is beautiful it's not slow at all I don't know what these other so called reviewers are talking about but from now on I'm gonna be in the one plus family for a long time. I only had this phone for a couple of days and it's doing well so far which I like other people on here expect more from a budget phone like why would you put high end stuff that you can only find with a thousand dollar phone and put it in a budget phone it's called a budget phone for a reason idiots. The battery holds up great for me and with all the reviews saying you can't add it to Sprint or Verizon network then don't cry and complain about it put it on another network and if you can't just buy another phone it's not that hard. When I get my paycheck again I'm gonna be buying the OnePlus 9 and I'll be back to reviewing another great phone HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! (Edit)This phone is trash now they're aren't new updates it's stuck on Android 11 and will not update it's slow and just good never get a cheap phone from a major company there will always be flaws.
3418,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I have always been an iPhone user, unfortunately my iPhone 11 stops working. In a rush to find a new phone  I give the chance to One Plus after checking many reviews. The phone appearance and interface is very friendly and easy to use. Even thought the phone have 3 cameras is difficult to get a fast shot.My trading apps runs smooth, also my games with the gaming mode runs like amazing!The fingerprint recognized fast the finger it remind me the old iPhone versions.I can say that the best feature of this phone is the battery it can last days among the the fast charging.If you find  yourself in a situation of a rush for a phone this is definitely your best option of the market."
3419,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"It works fine for a year plis and then it drains the battery, starts working really slow and the UE becomes really annoying."
3420,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Can't enlarge the keyboard to a size anywhere close to sufficient for seniors. Can't find any gps on it. Seems like a VERY lite android version, which is inconvenient. Cameras are very bad. Battery life is great! I appreciate the 64gb internal storage. I never use face recognition or fingerprint readers as I find them ridiculous and unnecessary unless you are hoping to send that extra info for  governmental use. Looks and feels good/quality. I don't hate it but can't recommend it either. For the price it's barely ok."
3421,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Pros- affordable, quick connection to internet.  I like the larger keypad that comes bc of larger screen.  I haven't used facial or fingerprint recognition to review.Cons- feels heavy compared to the S8.  Too many apps in the set up.  Some are mine of course.  It is so different from my Samsung's, which were so easy to upgrade from a previous model S.Battery life A+I'm not super tech savyThat said, a month out, and I am getting used to it.For around a $250+- it is a good phone."
3422,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I am a multi phone user. When it came to investing in a phone for work I did my research and looked for the most middle middle performing phone out there. This was it. It has performed above expectations without overachieving and does not compete with my higher end flagships. But as a solid phone with the ability to get some mileage out of it for the cost, the battery and okay performance this phone is good."
3423,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"Was hoping for a little more out of a OnePlus phone and this did not live up to the hype. I know it was cheap, but couldn't even switch between apps without launching the app again."
3424,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"This is a Super Nice phone. These phones are (NOT) locked to T-Moblile. My carrier is AT&T. It has an advanced technology, operating system, function, and the fingerprint reader works better than any phone I've had. Having said that, it's very easy to setup. I have AT&T as my carrier, I just swaped the sim card from my old phone and it was ready to setup. Keep in mind this phone does have a Setup Wizard which guides you throught the process. It does have a slot for expandable memory. The technology of this phone works great, I have a pair of Raycon E55 earbuds that have the new 5.0 bluetooth technology (stereo sound) and they sounded awesome on my previous phone but they sound even better on this new N200 5G. I was conflicted between buying the N200 5G and N10 5G, both are very similar but personally I think the N200 5G is the better model. Do yourself a favor and spend an extra few dollars to buy the suggested phone protection case with a black surround. This phone is worth protecting the cameras on the back, against shock if dropped, and it will keep the phone from sliding around as it is very lightweight (but very good quality) and has a slick surface. I can't say enough about how impressive this phone is. Buy it!!!Update 10-4-2022. I've had this phone for over a year and it still works great!!! I've since then switched carriers from AT&T to T-Mobile for a better rate. The T-Mobile switch was super easy and the service-reception & transmission is as good if not better. This is an awesome phone, buy it with confidence!"
3425,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,I like the design and the fingerprint recognition is excellent
3426,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I normally buy an unlocked Android every 2 years. I go generic or off brand. This is my third OnePlus. It's by far my worst experience.The phone is just slow and horribly buggy. I had to do navigation for my wife while driving. By the time the app loads we have passed our exit.When I have to take a picture of the kids, by the time my phone unlocks and the camera application has loaded the moment has passed.Sometimes I'll need to do something with my Tesla car with my phone. I look like an idiot waiting on this stupid phone to load so I can open my car charging port.It also works in about 90% of the places my wife's phone works on TMobile.My ownership experience has been mostly disappointment and frustration. I can't recommend this to anyone who isn't on a budget or desperate."
3427,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I'm disappointed - I really like the phone...  Thumb print reader was far more reliable than the Pixel, battery life was good, navigation made sense to me.  Sadly, the GPS gave up working just a few days after the 1 year mark"
3428,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"The Nord is a solid budget phone, with a bright screen and excellent battery life. The camera is the downfall, itâ€™s just average, but usable. Occasionally, the software will lag slightly, but not enough to not really like this phone. The feature that makes up for this is the 5G support. Itâ€™s good. Relative to the price, Iâ€™d buy it again. Recommended"
3429,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I need a phone to browse the web, access some media apps, read books, use chat apps, use maps, maintain my calendar, and send texts/calls.  That's it.  The occasional video watching, too.This phone is glorious, the battery life is huge (I can go 2.5-3 days without recharging).  It doesn't get warm when used for long periods.  It is much faster than my way old outdated phone.Unless you consume media (streaming, videos, active gaming) predominantly on your phone, this one is fantastic.  And it met all of my needs and then some.  Fingerprint scanner can be a little fussy, but thankfully it's not really high on my needs."
3430,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"The main issue I've experienced, although there were others as well, is with the Voice Mail function.  EVERY time that I raise the phone near my face to listen to a message, the message immediately stops playing.  I've been through the tech help procedure twice. You know, trying to follow test procedures given on the phone by someone with a barely understandable accent. Then getting my lengthy call escalated to another ""more qualified"" tech agent again in ASIA. Still had no success. I returned the phone as defective by their suggestion. I simply ordered an identical replacement phone. Guess what I got.  An identical problem as the first phone. These appear to be SUBSTANDARD phones to me. I cannot recommend a purchase of this phone to anyone.  I'm quite disappointed with it.  Also, it is now a true 5G phone as advertised. But that is another issue.  UDATE: Few days later, now the phone is completely unusable. It has gone berserk! I can't even describe all the bizarre things it is doing. I lost $200 and my mind over this useless phone. UPDATE: After a lengthy and eventful conversation with an Amazon Help agent I got some success. The phone went haywire. It even dialed EMERGENCY on its own. With the Sheriff knocking at my front door to check up on me due to the false emergency call, I got a little more ""animated"" with the Amazon agent via chat(the phone was inoperable) on my PC. Result? ""I've successfully process your refund amounting of $225.21 Your refund will reflect on your gift card balance within 1-3 hours.â€‹"" Yeah for Amazon and the devil with OnePlus Nord N200 | 5G Unlocked Android Smartphone U.S Version.  I want nothing more to do with this phone or vendor"
3431,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"I bought this cell for my daughter who is an aerospace engineering student at UCF in Orlando FL.It works extremely well in our area of Kissimmee which is notorious for bad cell reception. Mint Mobile's coverage and cost along with  the OnePlus Nord N200 | 5G has helped her through the pandemic and online courses as well as her association responsibilities. I can't say enough good things about this cell phone, having had numerous others prior to it. I strongly recommend to anyone who wants an affordable, dependable cell to help them get through our hectic lives."
3432,OnePlus,N200,64 GB,"OxygenOS 11, Android 11,",6.49 Inches,"The phone was great for the first couple of weeks in maybe June 2022, but only after downloading ALL of the system updates, it turned to trash very fast. I don't know if the system updates were a correlation or causation, but soon after, it would overheat just from having the Home Screen open. It'd freeze in camera mode, apps would crash. Couldn't watch YouTube on low quality without the phone cooking your bare hands. All the general android operating system faults and errors you'd expect to happen is what you got in less than 30 days of owning this device. HD phone calls are great, the camera quality is comparable to a 2019 model iPhone, the external audio is great, the phone is very clean in its outward design. But that doesn't outweigh the cons. I returned the device because after all the updates, including the nord preloaded apps' updates, the phone couldn't complete simple processes as well anymore."
3433,Sony,XQBQ62/B,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.1 Inches,"I really do like the phone over all. I wished the finger print sensor was in a different location as I some times hit it accidentally. It works ok buy my old BlackBerry key2 (yes BlackBerry) space bar one worked way better and did not hit it accidentally.  The aspect ratio of 21:19 is a little troubling to get used to but after 3 weeks of use I have adjusted. It is nice to be able to hold in one had and text. I guess the benefit of the longer narrow. Love that I can still use a sd card.ans dont need a paper clip to get out. The camera app is a little more difficult to get used to compared to other phone but is ok. There are some great feature like the auto focus select. Will tract faces really well even if running. It does get warm when shooting video but I have not had it over heat yet. It is definitely slippery if not in a case. As a side note there are not alot of cases to choose from. Battery life is ok I get through the day with our having to charge in less gaming on. Normally I have the settings adjusted to minimize usage. The screen quality is pretty good it the the iphone 13 is brighter. I wish was a little better in sun light. I do like how there are no cut outs for the ear speaker. I wished the price was a little lower. I got free earbuds with mine as this was the promotion so i justified it as being a little cheaper. Over all it is a nice phone and actually not a bad substitute for BlackBerry for those looking to switch since there will be no more. The expandable storage, finger sensor are great to have (especially since  wearing mask). Almost for got still has head phone jack which is great to ad external stuff like mics and Sony accessories."
3434,Sony,XQBQ62/B,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.1 Inches,"This phone is perfect for me, great camera, snappy processor, and amazing display.  However, the warranty sucks, I have been trying for 5 days to get a shipping label for my phone.  If I knew the warranty service was junk I would not have bought the phone.Update: Sony warranty service Personnel have no clue how their warranty process works, it took me 6 days of begging and screaming at them to get my shipping label. Their repair center will go Incognito for days not providing Sony updates all to find out that Parts aren't available and it'll take at least two weeks to repair the phone. If you buy the Sony Xperia 5 III, pray you don't have to go through the warranty process. Sony has refused to go above and beyond during this warranty process, past service experience with other companies after the initial screw up they would bend over backwards to make sure I was impacted very little. Again this is a great phone better than any Samsung that I've ever had, however Samsung beat Sony in the warranty process."
3435,Sony,XQBQ62/B,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.1 Inches,"This replaced an S20 I wanted to shove into the garbage disposal.  Everything works significantly better in comparison.  I no longer have to disable the 5g radio if it's cloudy, I can use a 5ghz wifi6 band  and I can even use emby again.During setup, it displayed a list of applications to install or skip.  GLORIOUS!  I no longer have to hide a dozen Google apps in a junk folder. There is some bloatware (couple games) but nothing near Samsung/lg/carrier levelsThe quickzoom on this one was higher than the s20 (4x vs 3x) and had better photos.  I also like that photos are overprocedsed less and look more natural.  You can always bump up the color levels but I do prefer Sony's path.My one and only complaint is the 21:9 ratio since I'm a holdover who still missed 16:9.  The screen isn't as bright as the Samsung but I don't need the screen to function as a flashlight.  Watching network server movies is beautiful on this also.Being that I'll switch to lineage if an efoundation rom doesn't come out, I love that the boot loader can be easily unlocked.I would've bought the 1iii if it was sub1K but I really love this one and I'm very happy with it.  I know that the glory that was the Z ultra will never return but I do wish they offered lower aspect ratios.  That difference would've made me go into the next price point happily"
3436,Sony,XQBQ62/B,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.1 Inches,"This one really let me down. I was really looking forward to it, as I've loved all previous Sony phones I've owned. As far as the good, the phone felt really good in my hands. It was a great size and a great weight. That's about it. The camera wasn't as good as I felt it should be. I've taken better pictures on phones that were obsolete 5 years ago. It's not to say it wasn't ""acceptable,"" it just wasn't great in my experience. Then we have the speakers. They ""felt"" loud, but I often couldn't truly hear what I was watching. But I definitely felt the vibrations. It would even tickle my hands to the point that it was difficult to hold the phone, and that was without the dynamic sound/ vibration enabled. Maybe my phone was defective in this aspect, because it also sounded like something was rattling around inside when you sat it down or moved it quickly. And then that brings us to the fingerprint reader, which was absolutely terrible. Literally 50% of the time or greater, i couldn't get it to read my prints. I even re-saved them hoping that would fix it, which it did not. Then, somehow, the phone would manage to unlock unprompted multiple times when removing it from my pocket. That's about it."
3437,Sony,XQBQ62/B,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.1 Inches,"I wanted to like this phone, I've wanted a Sony phone for a while as it met all my expectations:~unlocked~expandable memory~headphone jack~front facing speakers~excellent camera~small form factor~side fingerprint scannerUnfortunately this phone overheats with simple facebook video chat and sending text messages.  I have no case on it and I'll typically set it on the dining table.  It'll freeze or start closing apps after only a few minutes.  I tried everything the people online have said but it continues to do overheat.  I want to support Sony as I think they're on a good one, and I'm soooooo over Samsung and Apple and wish there was more competition in the market.Sony, if you're reading this, please get the cooling situation under control.  I haven't even tried playing playstation games on it, but if it can't even handle facebook video chat and scrolling Amazon at the same time, I don't think it'll last playing ps4 games.I'm returning this and going back to my Z Flip3....awaiting for the next iteration from Sony..."
3438,Sony,XQBQ62/B,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.1 Inches,"Coming from a larger, gaming phone the thinness was strange at first, but after the first week is unnoticeable. Camera is great, connection is about 4/5 in most cities, and call quality is good as well. I use the phone with my right hand and consistently hit the multi window button, which can't be stopped/uninstalled, and is a pain to close every time. The 888 processor runs too hot in this phone even more so with a case on it. I know any game or app I play with begin to stutter with the 120 hertz refresh rate on, down to 60 or lower. This makes any reaction based games unfun to play.All and all decent phone for professional and day to day use in spurts. For any games I just use my old phone connected to the hotspot feature on this phone.Value wise I purchased this phone around $1000 and feel it worth more around 700-800 for my use case."
3439,Sony,XQBQ62/B,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.1 Inches,"seeing how this phone has the ability to have a sd card and a 1/4"" audio jack using a fairly recent processor is great. I only had over heating issues when this is sitting in the car an in the sun on a hot day. i can play Diablo immortal no issues. plus the camera is good and it had a option to play music in the background while on a call. So much I like about this phone more than a samsung."
3440,Sony,XQBQ62/B,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.1 Inches,"Faster than my ThinQ G8 and much better call clarity. I love the narrow screen (can reach whole keyboard one-handed). SD card and headphone jack are why I got it. I use my phone as a flashlight all the time, and this one might as well not have one. Latest update seems to have fixed the bugs."
3441,Sony,XQBQ62/B,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.1 Inches,"This review is for the US version at $800 ($200 off).  It's a compact phone with flagship specs, i.e. Snapdragon 888 + 1080p OLED display.  Its 21:9 display allows me to watch movies without the black bars on the top/bottom.  But regular 16:9 videos (most of youtube) will either have black bars on the sides, or if you choose to zoom to fit, have the top/bottom cut off.  The tall aspect ratio is great for browsing and split screen use.  The phone feels fast/snappy overall.  Bottom line, it works as I expected, no complaints so far."
3442,Sony,XQBQ62/B,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.1 Inches,"I really, really wanted to like this phone. It had the design features I desired -- narrowest android flagship phone, a headphone jack while still being water proof. No notch for a camera.This said, all the details I got to know as time went on were very, very disappointing. First, the call quality and cell reception is way worse than my Galaxy S9 was as well as several iPhones I've tested from the same physical location... This could have been fine if there was Wifi calling -- I was shocked to learn after purchasing that this flagship phone does not support it. It also looks like most other recent xperia phones have the same problem. Additionally the glass was very easily scratched -- worse than my Galaxy S9. The unlock finger print reader doubles as the end call button so if you try to unlock the phone while on a call, need to be careful not to press the button fully as it will hang up on the call. Other weird things are things like the phone recommending you restart it every few weeks and relatively slow charging (though a decent enough battery life for me).The worst part of buying this phone (besides its price tag) is that I found I prefer my 3-4 year old Galaxy S9 to it. If any other flagship phones existed on the market with a headphone jack, I'd switch to that without a second though despite how much I really wanted to like this phone."
3443,Sony,XQBQ62/B,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.1 Inches,"First, worked with my old Verizon sim card right away.  With a weak 5g signal inside my house, still manages a very fast 117Mbps, so no carrier related issues. The pro reviews I read all seem accurate.  Camera and zoom are very good, but it is a more pro-focused camera as opposed to a glitzy over-processed point and shoot like my wife's Galaxy.  All operations are fast and screen is responsive.  I migrated over from a Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact so everything was very familiar.  Many reviewers complained about the fingerprint sensor. I get it, it takes some getting used to, but after 24 hours it's becoming second nature.I would assume that if you're going to spend $1000 you're going to do some research. I did and so far this phone had delivered exactly what I expected.  That being said, in 3 or 4 years when I'm shopping for my next phone I hope SOMEBODY is making a small form-factor phone with flagship quality features."
3444,Sony,XQBQ62/B,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.1 Inches,"Great phone wish it had a good battery life like my Xperia xa2 but it's on par with it.  I like how it has no camera notch or punch hole and all screen.  If you're buying it choose option which includes the Sony ear buds, otherwise your paying for a pricey phone."
3445,Sony,XQBQ62/B,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.1 Inches,"Este procesador o la optimizaciÃ³n estÃ¡ pÃ©sima, en general la baterÃ­a aguanta bien y la calidad del celular es buena pero demasiado resbaloso hasta que un logra ponerle estuche.

3446,Sony,XQBQ62/B,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.1 Inches,One of the few Verizon and android dual SIM phones. Fingerprint reader is glitchy. Notification volume and speakers are a tad low. Everything else is great. 5 star Sony.

3448,Sony,XQBQ62/B,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.1 Inches,This phone is the perfect size and very pocketable. It is very slippery so you almost can never use it without a case. 5G was not supported on Metro PCS but the phone was still fast performing task. Call quality was perfect and battery life was great but charging speeds needs improvement. This phones major flaw is after the initial setup it refused to connect to my home wifi. I've never had this problem with any other Android phone and Sony's customer support was none existent. Unfortunately I had to return my device.
3449,Sony,XQBQ62/B,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.1 Inches,"Decent size phone. Easily fits in my pocket, even with a case (which I highly recommend). Sound is good. Phone does give off heat while charging or heavy use (playing a game, watching youtube, or using an app for more than 10 minutes)My biggest complaint is battery life. I have 120 hz display disabled and most apps disabled and I can lose 10% charge in about 15-30 minutes of normal usage. The only thing that sort of balances that is the fast charging. I had a much cheaper samsung phone with way less features but the battery can last me 2 days at least with normal/moderate usage."
3450,Sony,XQBQ62/B,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.1 Inches,Videos looked pretty bad on this phone which is surprising. The aspect-ratio is just odd. Who thought it was a good idea to put all the buttons one side of the phone (awkward for taking screenshots). Very minimal UI refinement really had me missing my Samsung (no way of organizing my apps in the app-drawer into folders). The front-facing camera is shockingly disappointing and the back-facing camera are a bit below average as well. Difficult to move my content over to this phone.The dealbreaker was the way phone performed when I tried to get things done faster by hooking up to my PC. It pushed me to install this janky Xperia companion software (which looks like spyware) which kept failing and crashing my File Explorer. My PC became very unstable just to move one file over. Whenever I pull my Samsung in works pretty seamlessly.I'm returning it.
3451,Sony,XQBQ62/B,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.1 Inches,"I've always liked my Sony Xperia phones---but, holy cow, a 5X price increase, just to get 5G (which my computer guy tells me isn't likely to work well for years---and that's IF it doesn't screw up air control and end up getting rolled back until the airlines are better prepared)? No thank you. I'll be using the free phone that ATT sent me."
3452,Sony,XQBQ62/B,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.1 Inches,"If you're considering this phone, you likely know full well what you're looking for - there simply aren't many devices on the market with an equivalent feature set or design. With that said, reviews that focus on the NEGATIVES are what I find most useful. Here are some unfiltered cons:-With Sony's low sale volumes, accessory ecosystem is near non-existent.-Unless you're watching more modern, Hollywood films, realize that MOST VIDEOS (YouTube, TV shows) ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR 21:9 ASPECT RATIO. This means you'll either be zooming/cropping, or watching with black bars. Either way, it's an unideal setup. If you watch with black bars, realize you have a SIGNIFICANTLY smaller 'effective' screen.-Screen brightness is directly comparable to entry level/midrange phones of 2-3 years ago ... fairly dim.-No variable refresh rate.-Capacitive fingerprint sensors are far more unreliable in comparison to optical/ultrasonic in-screen readers. They simply work in far less situations. For me personally, my fingerprint sensor works <50% of the time, to the point I have it disabled.-Speaker quality and haptics are adequate at best; I'd describe both as sound (or feeling) ""hollow.""-Poor charging features; relatively slow charge time, no wireless charging.-Snapdragon 888 does have thermal issues. Especially when charging, gaming, or with high performance apps (i.e. recording video). I haven't gotten an overheating warning yet, but it is winter, and does get noticeably warm in my hand.-Camera functionality is simply not good for point-and-shooting. If picture quality matters to you, and you don't understand the exposure triangle + shoot RAW/post-process yourself, this is not the phone for you.-Cell reception/service is worse in comparison to my Pixel (Verizon).-You will run into bugs. Know that most aren't necessarily inherent to Sony (Android has been a mess from late 2021 to present), however it still impacts usability.With these points, you have to weigh what is in my opinion, the biggest con: COST, lack of resale/trade-in value (non-existent compared to brands like Samsung), and shorter Sony support life.Quick pros include:-Fantastic form factor, with certain design elements+aesthetics that are best in the market.  Obvious important design choices include a 3.5 jack, (tool-less) SD slot, notification light, dedicated assistant/shutter button, IP68, notch/cutout-less-21:9 is great for feed-based consumption.-Solid camera hardware+controls oriented towards prosumers"
3453,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I purchased the F3S to replace my Umidigi A7 Pro which I purchased in 2020. I was reading about this device and could not find it on Amazon.ca but did find it available on Amazon.com. Shipping to Canada was much faster than I had anticipated taking only 4 business days to get to me. I've used the FS3 for a few days now and here are my first impressions. First off the setup was the easiest I've ever had with a phone(not sure if that praise is to Google or Umidigi or both), I was up and running with all my apps downloading in under 5 minutes. The device arrived with the battery at around 90%. There was a system update waiting after the initial setup. If you haven't used a Umidigi device before one thing that surprises me is their continued update support. The day after purchasing this device I received a system update for my 2 year old A7 Pro, a lot of manufactures will stop releasing any updates a year after they are released Umidigi breaks this norm. The packaging was very slick and simple, it did not give the impression that this was a budget device. The device was very secure in the packaging no jostling what so ever. There were also stickers on the front and back of the device showing the features and layout of the phone which was handy. The package also contains a USB Charger/good quality cable(looks the same as the cable that came with my A7 Pro which is still functioning after 2 years). There is also a gel case that comes with the device, it is good quality but I find that it can get slippery to hold, I have ordered two other cases to replace it. The phone operates smoothly for my day to day tasks, the battery lasts me the day and if I forget to plug it in overnight I still have about 20-25% battery in the morning. It can also handle gaming as well(although the device does get fairly warm). The finger print reader has so far been very reliable not many misreads and no lock outs. The shortcut button is a handy feature although one draw back is it will only function when the screen is on. I've set mine up to: Flash light, Camera, Voice Record for single press, double press, and long press respectively. I did have a minor issue with reconnecting to hidden wi-fi networks but was able to resolve this by going into the developers options and disabling ""Wi-Fi scan throttling"" it seems to be a battery saving option, if you don't need to connect to a hidden network you will have no hassles. The speaker is a single speaker it does the job but its not anything special, I rarely use it I prefer to use headphones. The FS3 also comes with a headphone jack which comes in handy when your ear buds die or are misplaced(hahaha). The headphone jack is on the top of the phone and the power cable plugs in to the bottom, I would have preferred them both being on the bottom but its not a big issue. I've trusted the Umidigi brand the last few years and when I needed a new phone I looked to them first because I knew I was going to get the best bang for my hard earned buck. So far I am very pleased with the phone and hope to get a few good years out of it."
3454,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I got this as an ""update"" to my last Umidigi phone - an A11 - because, while I really liked the A11, I've gotten it in my head that I need a phone with NFC capabilities.I'm glad I decided to pull the trigger on the purchase, especially considering the price on Prime day.As always with Umidigi, the packaging itself is attractive, eye-catching, and high quality by itself. The phone inside of that packaging is the same.The screen size is great for watching media and the back of mine is a sparkling black color. All of the Umidigi phones I've had have been made of high-quality materials - both the screen and the rear of the phones are basically impossible to scratch. I'm absolutely *terrible* at holding onto things, so I drop my phone on hard surfaces multiple times a day and keep it in my purse pocket along with my keys. Despite this, I haven't had a screen or screen protector on an Umiidigi phone break or scratch at all.Not only is this F3S fast with its 6gb of RAM, the fingerprint sensor is *extremely* responsive and the battery has lasted me though 36 hours of relatively constant use. The NFC feature is honestly just fantastic. I've used it far more than I probably should have in the seven days I've had it with no problems and I'm so glad they included it on this model.The camera is really nice as well. The shutter speed doesn't have any delay and the image quality is very good. I haven't really had many things to take photos of because the weather has been terrible and my house is a mess, but I got a *really* good picture of my cat in pretty low light (I also included an accidental awesome picture of her from when I was trying out the ""burst"" mode while she was grooming herself in this review even though it's a bit blurred because she was moving lol)The only problem that's come up on this phone thus far is an issue with the notification volume being super loud sometimes, even when the phone is on silent. I did figure out that this is an Android issue (as opposed to a manufacturer problem) because I found the solution on a Pixel forum - for anyone experiencing this, the OS apparently gets the notification and media volumes mixed up. All you have to do is turn your media volume down to fix it. Kind of annoying, but not a particularly big deal.If you *do* happen to have any actual phone problems, Umidigi's customer service is absolutely top notch. They're super responsive and very helpful. I haven't had any real issues since a couple of phones ago, but any time I have needed to contact them (obviously within the year warranty), they've responded within 24 hours (not including weekends) and have solved my problems quickly - including being happy to replace a defective unit."

Â I've had several UMIDIGI phones before, but this one really stands out.  First, it's the right size for me (I'm 6'4"" and have a big head lol).  It fits perfectly in my hand and feels ""just right"" when making a call.  No fumbling with a smallish phone in my large hands, yet fits nicely in my front pants pocket.  It's amazingly light, too.This listing does a great job of describing the features and the reviews do well too so I will only emphasize ones that stand out for my own use.  They describe the screen as ""cinema-like immersive visual experience"" and it no hyperbole.  It is *stunningly* smooth, no shadowing and has absolutely incredible viewing angles.  It has a nice size for video viewing and is large enough to use for ebook reading.  It's actually the first phone that I found reading ebooks to be comfortable on, without eyestrain.It is fast, too.  Boots immediately and is very smooth between apps.  Battery life is really good too, but isn't too much different than my last UMIDIGI phone.  The very best thing is how well the thumb-based fingerprint reader works!!  This is the *ideal* location for a reader, as it is right where you naturally hold the phone and is on the button to open it.  I have never seen a reader work so fast recognizing and how fast the phone itself opens!I have but 3 negatives - this phone is awesome and loaded, so why not 2 speakers in stereo?  The screen is cinematic and gorgeous, and the absence of this is regrettable.  The next 2 are a bit of personal preference - while the camera is incredibly good, I could do with a bit lesser camera to have to have less of a camera bump.  I go caseless (it is gorgeous and made of durable material) and it rocks all over the place when on a desk or table.  While using the included case alleviates this, it still rocks a lot with it on.  Lastly, while UMIDIGI made the ""Beyond Dreams"" tagline less obtrusive than my previous phone, it is still there and just bugs me.  Just go with your brand and perhaps the model number.I tried to get some nice screenshots and a video of the smoothness of it but I cannot capture how nice it is in person.  It's first rate, comparable to the top of the line phones of other manufacturers.  At this price, it is a terrific buy that will serve well for years to come."
3456,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Let's get this out of the way early, once again Umidigi has created a beautiful phone. I chose the 'Starry Black' over the 'Ocean Blue' this time and it's just as stunning as the blue is.Highlight #1 - NFC  - let me repeat, NFC that supports Google Pay, on an inexpensive phone for the U.S.A. market = #Winning.Highlight #2 - A full 6GB of ram and 128GB of LPDDR4X based storage. Storage is expandable.Highlight #3 - 5150mAh Battery. Coupled with the entry level Unisoc T610 Octa-Core Processor, which basically sips battery, this phone should get you through a full day of useage without breaking a sweat.Highlight #4 - 6.7-inch Display. It's crisp and clear and does surprisingly well outside. Ok, the colors are going to be washed out in bright, direct sunlight, but at least you can still read the screen if the need arises.Highlight #5 - Sony 48MP AI Triple Camera. I;ll need to read up and take some picturesHighlight #6 - Still comes with a headphone jack. Bluetooth still doesn't quite cut it for audio performance and I am glad to promote a phone that still includes a headphone jack.Highlight #7 - They have included a wall charger in the box.For us old-school peeps who still listen to FM Radio, Umidigi has included one. And gome one step farther by NOT requiring a headphone to be connected to be used as an antennae - it works without one just fine.A quick stop at some niggling points: the auto-brightness algorithm could use some improvement and Umidigi doesn't exactly provide timely updates, but does seem to release an update to fix issues.Th UI is basically stock Android. No fluff, no extra, duplicated, unneeded apps.Fingerprint reader is integrated with the power button which is on the right side of the phone beneath the volume rockers, and is as responsive and accurate as expected.On the left side of the phone is a 'smart key' (button) that you can use to initiate up to three different actions such as: screen shot; start recording; open an app.I've gotten some pretty good pictures although I haven't tested the 'night mode' yet. There are standard and 'pro' shooting modes along with HDR and some different filters to enhance your shots and selfies.I still don't know how Umidigi continues to roll out mid-range performing phones and feature sets at bottom-tiered pricing."
3457,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Bought this specifically for the NFC and WIFI calling capability. Only after I bought it did I find out it would not work with both my endoscope and Flir thermal USB cameras. Interestingly the Flir camera actually connects and is visible in the program but then immediately disconnects and terminates the program.  This obviously indicates the phone is capable of the connection and appears to be ""coded"" or programmed to terminate camera operation. When I contacted the seller they said the camera will not work and is not supposed to. Thus four stars."
3458,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I got this phone I liked the phone however it was a 3G phone which most companies no longer support it is not a 5G phone which it is listed under  please change the wording on this phone

Â For the price I paid the phone has everything that I need without breaking the bank. It features a large screen, plenty of storage (128gb) and generous amount of ram (6gb). For this price point I had been looking at phones with 4gb ram and 64gb storage.When first turning on the phone I went through the setup quickly. The fingerprint reader is a must have and I set three fingers with ease. Unlocking the phone with my fingerprint is seamless each time without hesitation. I went to the OTA updates and updated the phone right out of the box, took a few minutes and everything was good to go.Having Voice over LTE and Voice over WiFi is great, it helps the call clarity and VoWiFi for when I'm in a poor reception area. Dual SIM is nice so I can use my personal and work line both on the same phone. You can disable the second SIM when not needed (so my work calls don't come in after hours).The 6.7"" screen makes things very easy to read and view. Playing games works very well for the screen size. It would be nice to have a faster refresh rate but I didn't expect this in the price bracket.The processor, gpu and ram make for a smooth experience for everyday use and handled all my gaming tasks without hesitation.The camera takes good pictures but the response time seems a bit sluggish when moving the phone around. But in all fairness I had compared this to my wife's phone which is the S22 and cost over $1000.The battery is quite large and lasts me a few days with work, games and day to day activities before I need to charge it up.Overall I'm quite pleased with my purchase. Getting the features that I need, and performance that I feel will last me a few years if not more before I feel the need to upgrade."
3460,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I come from Blu G90 Pro and wow with 6GB of ram makes a big difference performance. Screen is bright clear video. Game is not too bad but Helio G90 can tell difference in game. Great phone if your looking for clean android user interface. Umidigi F3S is speedy.
3461,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Phone is great for the price and nice looking.  So far it works fine.  Great that it has large storage size.  Camera quality is not very sharp.  Maybe need to adjust setting.
3462,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Overall an excellent phone for the price with some nice features that exceed the price tag. Phone is very similar to other phones classified as mid end phones.The box comes with a charger, USB type C cable, pre-installed screen protector and phone case. The phone has a good macro camera with a screen that exceeded my expectations for the price tag. Also the 6GB of RAM and the ability to lock apps makes it really easy to multi task. There are 2 key features that exceed the price tag of this phone. First, NFC which is something I need in any phone in order to use Google Pay or scan my house and car keys. Second, the Smart Key which is an extra button on the left side of the phone which is also customizable (see pics).Cons:The single speaker is loud enough but coumd be a little more clear."
3463,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The Umidigi F3s runs lag free, The battery is exceptional, it gives me about a day and a half of use, The camera takes vibrant and well detailed photos, the phone display is bright and good at it's price point. There is 6gb ROM and 128gb of RAM enough storage for all your apps, photos, videos and music. I also like the fact that it's dual sim. Overall it's a great phone at it's price point making it well worth the money."
3464,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Everything good, maden with care, packed with accessories and most handy: 3 in 1 programmable button I use for telegram, teams and flashlight."

Â It's hard to find a reasonably priced phone with good features, but this one seems to come through in a lot of areas while still keeping the price pretty low. 128 GB storage, 6 GB ram, 5,000+ mAh battery... It's hard to complain about this phone! The multifunction button is the cherry on top for this new budget offering from Umidigi."
3466,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Nice product with good capture and navigation.
3467,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I pick this phone and was told it works on the Verizon network. But it doesn't.
3468,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I have had it with my Umidigi Power 3 phone! I absolutely will never buy another product from them. From the first it did NOT work as it should on the most basic of functions of a cell phone---making a phone call! (the sound was barely audible on phone calls even at highest level with using speaker I had to yell at all times when making a call). This occurred as soon as I activated this phone. The screen then cracked shortly thereafter from a very SMALL drop of say 3 feet from my back pocket onto the kitchen floor (linoleum tile). I got my money back though. Maybe their newer phones are better...but I just wish someone warned me about Umidigi cell phones as I researched and believed the hype....what do I have now? a motorola and it too is a brand I will never buy again... its got a bad chip issue which makes ghost calls and the  ringer works only when it wants to.....

3483,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Update: 4g stopped connecting and their customer support is a joke. First impossible to contact then impossible to get any answers.Considering prices inflation these days, you will be having a very hard finding a phone that cam do pretty much everything a top liner would do. The price starts at 240$ tax so imagine when they are on a promotion, the price would be even better.First of all the design is beautiful, I mean the colors and the glass back panel. I am not a big fan of iphone like cameras arrangement but that is fine. The front screen has just a small dot on top which serves as a camera.Some people complain about connectivity when they insert a sim card but I havent experiences anything similar. I would suggest to read the manual carefully and contact the seller, I am pretty sure it could be figures out.The fund works as a charm, it has a prety good battery capacity and it allows it to last for around whole day. Depending on usage of course. The camera doesnt take the best shots but they are still decent. Remember the price and lower your expectations. It allows you to surf internet, play games, do your work, listen to music, study, etc. And all that with ease"
3484,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The overall design of the phone is really good. I bought the blue version and it's as in the picture. The phone came in a yellow box with a cable, adapter and papers (also a sim card remover).The phone itself is really powerful because it never lags. it has 6 gb ram and a lot of storage (128gb).As you can also see in the pictures the camera is really good, it takes realistic photos and especially with vif colors.Finally the battery serve well because it's quite big (5150 mah).The phone has also nfc which is great.In short, it's a good phone for pretty much anything : gaming, social networks, youtube, photo shooting..."

3492,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"My wife needed a new phone, as hers was acting up and being unreliable. So I came across this brand, as I remember reading good things about the brand, and reading many reviews and studying the specs. On paper this seems to be a good phone, much better than the Motorola one that my wife wanted to get from Costco for $200. After researching the phone for a while, I decided to order it and give it a try, shipping was fast and arrived the next evening. Opened the box, set up the phone, transfering everything over from the old phone was a breeze. That's where it stopped being a great phone. It couldn't stay connected to WiFi, constantly disconnected without my wife noticing this caused her to go way over her mobile data limit and resulted in a nice extra on the phone bill. Next, call quality was very bad, person on the other end of phone would hear a computerized like voice, with constant cut outs making calls and conversations hard to have. Lastly the camera which is supposed to be 48MP was very grainy/blurry, and the zoom was only 2x which make the picture quality worse.It's too bad since it is a very nice looking phone, maybe I got a lemon, but maybe not. Anyways I returned it after a week of using it without any issues with the return. Didn't want to take a chance and exchange it for another unit."
3493,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"UMIDIGI F3SI spotted this phone and was impressed with the specs to price point.It has a 48 MP camera on the back which takes really nice pictures. I haven't had a chance to take any night pics yet but think that will be good as well. The front camera takes nice selfie pics as wellAndroid 11, lots of internal storage and a spot for an SD card as well.It also has a second sim slot which will come in handy on the next trip down south.I am writing this review on the phone right now and the screen is nice and sharp.I am looking forward to using this as my daily driver."

3495,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Overall, definitely a phone worth it's price. It has good storage and RAM, great battery life, and the 48 mp camera is fantastic. The phone is slimmer and longer than some other phones, allowing it to fit better within my hand, without losing any screen size. The package includes not only the phone, but a simple clear case and a charger (USB Type-C). My one slight problem is some of the UI preferences that I have not been able change to my liking, but I will get used to those over time. As always, UMIDIGI has given me a phone that I very much enjoy with a very affordable price."
3496,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"So far I love it! Very smooth, very fast.  Light weight but not too light where it feels plastic. Audio is good, very clear. Could have a little more bass but not complaining. Pictures are actually excellent. I'm comparing them to my iphone 12 Pro. I'll see how the battery life is but so far its good too. The next thing I would hope to see is wireless charging for this. Comes with its own phone case. But overall, this is an amazing phone for a great price."
3497,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Jâ€™ai commander ce Umidigi comme telephone de backup, mais il mâ€™as beaucoup surpris. Performance / prix trÃ¨s intÃ©ressant. Sont seul point faible est la qualitÃ© des photos. Fonctionnel, mais loin dâ€™un iPhone. Jâ€™en suis satisfait et je recommande!"
3498,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The F3S with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage is a nice step up from the A13S I was previously using. The apps are snappier, able to handle more open apps at once.I know this is a cost effective phone, but my only drawback is the slow response of the screen. You can see the refresh rate while scrolling through facebook and Instagram, but I'm also spoiled with my Pixel 6. The screen is bright, the face unlock is great.I noticed that this F3S supports dual sim, but you have to sacrifice the microSD slot, where as the A13S has both sims and a MicroSD. But with the 128GB you likely won't need the SD anyway.The camera is much better, with the Sony 48MP lens. Still a bit of a lag between button press and shutter though.Again, comes with a silicon case and screen protector pre-installed. Love this.All in all a decent phone. I would recommend."

3501,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I bought one of these in August and like it so much that I bought my wife one. Great camera on it. It holds a lot of apps and runs all of them great. Lots of memory in it too. I would put it up against other phones that are in the 500-600 dollar range..
3502,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"This is the 3rd Umidgi phone I have purchased over the years. The other two were a Bison and F2 and this was my least favorite of the 3.

3503,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"I wanted a very basic phone for my 3rd grader so that he could reach me easily but don't want him to have access to the internet (especially social media) yet. I didn't realize how difficult it would be to find a relatively cheap phone that would function purely as a call/text phone. I settled for this Nokia because 1)internet/apps access would at least be difficult, 2)Nokia's are generally known for being sturdy, 3)it's price was decent, and 4)it looked nice.1) internet/app access- unfortunately, a version of the Facebook app comes preloaded on the phone for some reason, as does the internet app. What's worse is that you can't delete these apps. For the time being, I've been able to circumvent the problem by turning wifi and data off on the app. I have also enrolled him in a more restricted phone service contract. I'm sure, as he gets older, he'll figure out how to turn on the wifi though. We've already had a discussion about why I don't want him on social media yet and I'm sure we'll have the discussion more in the future. Also, I wish there was a way to limit incoming calls. He gets so many spam calls and I've seen that more upscale phones can block all incoming calls from unknown numbers- I wish this phone had that capability.2) sturdiness- not quite as sturdy as the old school Nokia's but not bad. My son has dropped it repeatedly and, in the event the screen has frozen or stopped responding, a hard reset (my removing the battery) has always gotten it working again. It is made of plastic though so I'm sure it can easily get scratched. I bought a screen protector and that has worked so far for the front. Battery life lasts several days despite using the phone (calls and games) for about an hour or two a day. We charge it about once or twice a week and it stays on.3)Price- this is about as cheap as you can get and still get a well-known brand. I saw a few off brand phones but noticed in the comments people repeatedly complaining that they didn't work in the US. This phone uses a 4G or 5G network which is what most areas require so it works fine. That being said, it's still a cheap phone. If there is any sound around my son when he calls it's difficult for him to hear me or me to hear him. It's also frustrating that there's no easy access volume controls, you have to go through the settings to adjust speaker, ring tone, or app volume.4) the way it looks- the color is a nice saphire blue, my son loves it.  The colors on the phone screen are ok- it's a basic pixel kind of phone but I expected that. I do with there were buttons for the volume as well as a button to turn the light/flash on/off. Without those, I don't think it's as functional as it could be. It comes preloaded with some basic old school games- another thing my son loves.Overall, it's a pretty good first phone for a kid. I don't think it has the basic functionality features a some senior citizens look for though."
3504,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"Great to detox from screentime and smartphone addiction. It does allow 2 factor authentication for banking to be viewed in texts. You can access voicemail. Allows just enough access to net, but in such a way that you won't be hooked to the screen wasting time all day and night.  May not be best for elderly, as it doesn't have analog sound buttons. It does support bluetooth.  Does not provide GPS for driving, or mobile hotspots. Battery life is great.  If you are a text junkie, probably not for you, as responding on the keypad would be a nightmare. If you can't stand being controlled by technology, this is your friend."
3505,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"I am grandfathered into the TMobile Pay As You Go Legacy Plan.I started with a cheap Nokia phone and when that went bought another cheap phone.The Nokia 1661.Just swapped in the full size sim card from the old phone and was good to go.With them doing away with the 2G and 3G networks I figured it just a matter of time before my phone would not work anymore. I assume it is a 2G phone. 3G at best.Now you have to understand I just need a phone. I barely use it. Hate texting and don't need internet.I just want to make and receive calls. Have voice mail pick up when I don't or can't answer the phone.So I purchased this phone hoping the 4G network would be around for awhile.But the first thing I did before I purchased the phone was go to a TMobile store and get a new sim card.They were able to transfer my plan to a nano sim card which is what the Nokia 225 uses.Which they did not charge me for by the way.But with the ""adapter"" I was able to use the nano card in my old phone, which uses a full size sim card, until the new one arrived.When it did I put the nano sim card in the phone and was good to go.It got right on the TMobile network without me doing a thing.Best I can tell I can make and receive calls.I believe the phone to be running on a 4G LTE network cause the letters are there on the screen.I could not really find answers to the questions I had about making this switch.I figure there are still people out there like me who don't want a smart phone.Few and far between though.I figured if I documented my circumstances and what I did in detail maybe it will help the next person.Battery life seems a little shorter then I think it should be seeing how I hardly use the phone and it is just sitting around when on. But not really that big a deal.It is little bigger then my old and that is nice. Being older, wearing glasses, etc.All in all I think I am going to be OK with this phone.I only hope that the networks this phone uses will be around for awhile.Cause I can't even begin to tell you how much I do not want a smart phone."
3506,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"This was just what I was looking for.Twenty years ago I was using a Motorola T-mobile To Go Prepaid pay-as-you-go cell phone.  Happy with it at the time... Buy $100 of prepaid minutes and get 'Gold Membership' so $.10 per minute and $.10 per text and you only have to put $10.00 once per YEAR to keep the phone active... zero monthly costs or minimums.  Slightly more complicated than that, but those who know, know what I'm talking about.Fifteen years ago, my employment give me a company phone that I can use for personal as well, so I give my T-mobile Gold Membership phone to my elderly mother to use as an emergency phone for travel or driving or power outtages.  Just have to put on $10 per year and she has an active cell phone with great battery life (compared to modern smart phones).  Life is good.BUT, time passes and the phone and (old full size) SIM card are 2g, which all carriers but T-mobile have sunseted (like 3g phones), and T-mobile is slowly letting die.  Service is getting spotty and will eventually go away, even if the phone is still perfectly functional.  Mom needs a new phone, but she's tool old to figure out how to use a smartphone (not willing) and the battery on them will die in a day.  Need a phone that just makes calls and the battery will last for a week or more plus uses the 4g network that will keep working when 2g goes away and that is this phone.I looked over other choices and did LOTS of research... be careful since many other cheap phones may not have the T-mobile / USA GSM frequencies (others might only have foreign GSM).  Also, some cheaper phones are just 2g phones, so watch out for that.I needed a new nano-sim that I got from T-mobile (check that you are getting one for pre-paid... I read the post-paid accounts might use a different sim, but not sure about that).  And I also read that you need a new sim as the old 2g sim cut to nano size will not work in a 4g phone or if it will will only work on whatever 2g network remains.The phone is just like you remember the candy bar Nokia phones from 20 years ago to be.  Not that that is necessarily a good thing in this easy to use smartphone world... but it makes calls and plays 'Snake'.Good luck."
3507,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"I'm not a Luddite, but I'll get a ""smart"" phone whenever I'm forced to.I was forced to get this phone because my old phone (which I lovingly had for about 10 years) did not support 4G.This one looked really similar, but when I got it, I found that it's not the same.The first thing, which I did notice from the photos, was that it does not have volume buttons on the side. Why? Just, why?  They're so useful!  And you need them with this phone bc it somehow always resets the volume to the loudest setting.  The instructions don't tell you how to set the volume when you're on a call, either (you click the center square's top or bottom part to increase/decrease the volume during a call).  Press and hold the bottom right button to be brought to the phone's ringing volume settings.Although, no matter how I get to the volume it's always way too loud.  Maybe this phone was made for old hard of hearing people or something.  I'll soon be deaf after using this phone, so then it'll come in handy.There are lots of other things not the same, like it's really hard to tell if you have a new text message unless you look at the list of alerts that come up, which I don't like, bc they're the only thing you can look at when they're there, so you have to scroll through them all before you can do anything else.  Even if I delete all my text messages, it still shows the little text icon at the top as if I have a message, but I don't.I can't easily switch between dictionaries like I did.  I used to be able to easily switch to Spanish if I needed to for the T9 texting feature, but I can't figure out how to do that unless I switch the whole phone's language.About the only thing I kind of like on this one is that text messages are in a conversation instead of separate, like on my old phone.  Oh, and the flashlight is ok, not great, but I never had one before to compare it to.So, if you don't want a ""smart"" tracking device, I mean phone, and you don't want a flip phone, then this is about your only affordable option.  Hooray for technological progress."
3508,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,I like using this phone to â€œdetoxâ€ from the smart phone.The battery life is good especially if I donâ€™t call or mess with it much.  Probably could charge it twice a week.  Itâ€™s super basic.  Forget using internet in any modern way.  I have found a few sites that I can manage to read some articles on.Cons:Canâ€™t adjust alarm volumeGroup texts are a messCamera is terribleCanâ€™t remove many apps like games.The â€œflash lightâ€ is a joke itâ€™s so dim and defusedWhat i would like to see in a good â€œdumbâ€ phone:Fix the above.Weather appAbility to stream music/podcasts.
3509,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"The phone does almost everything I need it to, which is to say: not a lot. It makes calls and sends texts. There are some other standard features, like a calculator, a calendar, alarm, etc., but I switched to this phone because my smartphone was taking over my life. In that regard, I love this device. It has freed me from the clutches of reddit addiction.But there's this weird, annoying bug. When receiving texts, the timestamp is set to 3 hours before. I am on the east coast so the texts are basically coming through with a california timestamp. As a result, the texts are out of order in the message history. I set my phone clock back 3 hours to compensate, but if the minutes and seconds aren't precisely right, then it still shows up wrong. The phone seems to lose a few minutes of time each week if you set it manually, so I keep having to reset the clock. That's my ONLY issue with this device"
3510,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"Had no serious issues with this phone so far, all base functionality seems working, VoLTE call audio quality is excellent. Haven't had the text message timestamp issue. I did have an issue where my carrier sent a ""sim update"" command over the network and I had to reboot to get the contacts to load again.I wish there was a good way to load additional software on it, but there's no app store and its strange ""S30+"" operating system seems largely undocumented with a proprietary SDK. Facebook app is undeletable, but I just don't use it. Other potentially unwanted programs are just dumb games.Overall, a good feature phone that stays truer to that goal than most of the crap you'll find out there nowadays. I bought it to use as a daily driver while I wait for a replacement for my buggy PinePhone."
3511,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"Itâ€™s adequate but not great. Itâ€™s lightweight, itâ€™s sturdy enough. Overall it works fine, but there are a couple key problems.The first one is that it does not always receive incoming calls or texts. Weâ€™re in a great coverage area but it will go straight to voicemail occasionally, or texts come through delayed, which makes it difficult to reach my son. But he never has a problem with outgoing calls, so at least he can reach me.The other problem is it has a bad feedback problem. I can hear myself echoing when I call him. He doesnâ€™t use the phone for anything, but if you have someone that wants to use it to chat a lot it is not good for that. I sent it back as defective and got a new one, that one didnâ€™t do it as much, but it went through the washing machine so we got another new one, and this one does it also. Since he doesnâ€™t use it for more than just calling me when he needs to be picked up, it doesnâ€™t bother me.I like that it has no access to data and it does work with Tello.  Actually, it does have a little access to data but it is so cumbersome and slow that he wonâ€™t even try to use it.I do recommended if you want a no data, cheap phone for a teen. I do not recommend it if you plan to spend a lot of times talking on it, or if you need incredible reliability on someone receiving incoming calls."
3512,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"I was looking to get a simple cellphone for my daughter so she can receive texts from us or call us if something comes up, withoutthe smartphone capabilities. I had older Nokia phones (before the age of smartphones) that were like little tanks with battery that lasted forever so I thought this would fit the bill. I was wrong.Setting up the phone and connecting to the network was straight forward, but here's where the problems began.1. The phone couldn't make or receive phone calls. I can't hear anything when making a call, nor did the other end ring. And the phone doesn't ring or give any indication of an incoming call, only that a call was missed afterwards. I confirmed the SIM works properly on another phone, so I guess this was a bad sample, not good as that's its main purpose as a phone.2. The unlock sequence is weird. When the phone is locked, you need to press the unlock button then the * button to unlock the phone, which is fine, but then the phone always ends up as if the menu button was pressed, which is not what I want. I want to check text messages or make a phone call. I couldn't find any option to change that, but if anyone knows what I'm doing wrong please leave a comment, it may be too late for me but it may help others.Because of the first problem I returned the phone and gave my daughter an older locked down smartphone."
3513,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"Very happy with this phone. My old 3g candy bar was soon going to become obsolete but bar phones aren't so available anymore. This one had just enough features and more importantly has both the required 4g LTE and VoLTE. You need both to sign up with the cheaper carriers like Tello. They use the T-Mobile network. In my outlying area I get 5/5 bars.Just note, mine arrived with the VoLTE turned off and my phone didn't work. You might have to turn it on to make calls. It's in the Settings screen at the bottom.The browser is pretty limited and wouldn't fully open several pages I tried. Don't expect much from it.Update.....The browser seems to have locked up and a  lock icon appears in the upper right of the screen. No idea what caused this.Update 2..It feels fragile and would probably break if dropped onto something hard. I only found one silicone type fitted case for it from China and quickly bought one. Same with screen protectors. Since it's a bar phone I think it would easily scratch if it's next to keys in your pocket.Update 3... Somehow the battery completely discharged and the phone only cycled through it's opening jingle and no button response. All it needed was a charge. I'm looking for an extra battery but it's hard to find out which are compatible. I think the BL-4UL will work. The battery seems to be ok now but I still want a spare.The browser is completely useless as is the Facebook app so it's ok for kids. Buy it just to use as a phone and very basic texting. People need to do research before they assume this phone will work for them. I use it with Tello (T-Mobile network) but had a terrible time getting NET10 to port my number. It took weeks. Tello was helpful but only NET10 was authorized to port the number."
3514,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"I really wanted to love this phone, but it seems old 100% reliable dumb phones are a thing of the past...  I have been using it as my only phone to cut down on distractions.  This phone is ALMOST perfect.THE GOOD:- I Love that it has LTE Voice... works great on T-Mobile.  Call quality is good, and I even filled it up with MP3s to listen to music while I work out.- Speaker phone is loud enough.  Especially considering the size of the phone.- I love that it has Bluetooth, which works almost perfectly (more on that below).  I connect to bluetooth headsets and my car.- Keys are easy on the fingers, and got used to navigating it in a day.- Browser usage is painful, but to me this is a plus, since my goal is to minimize distractions.- Battery life is pretty good.  I'm on calls throughout the day, connected to bluetooth, and have no problems with it lasting all day.- Added 32 Gig SD card filled with MP3s (could not get 128GB card, seems like 32 is the max)THE BAD:- Text messages have the wrong time!  I tried playing with the clock settings, but this is not the issue.  Does not matter if you set the time or put it in ""auto"" the text messages that come in have the wrong time.  You'll see other reviews mention this.- It has frozen me a few times.  When I say frozen, I mean completely frozen where holding the power button doesn't even power off the device.  I am not getting this as often as other people on the reviews,  but it does happen.- I noticed that the bluetooth range kind-of sucks.  If I am listening to music and put my phone farther than arm's length, sometimes the music breaks up.THE UGLY:- When I am on speaker people on the other side say I am cutting off.  This does not happen when I am off speaker or using my bluetooth headset.  Only happens on the speakerphone and it's really disappointing.  When I am on a conference call, I have it on speaker until it's time for me to talk.CONCLUSION:I'll keep using this phone until I find something better.  This has everything I want, just wish it was more polished."
3515,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"The phone is fine for the low price - you get the long battery life and long talk time - I regularly go a week between charges, with active usage for phone and text. The browser is basic - you can access google and some sites, but anything with a lot of scripting (banking sites, for example) won't work.There are a few problems - particularly if you are an AT&T user or like to Text:#1 - If you check AT&T's list of supported 4G phone, this phone is not listed. So while it may work for now - after February 2022 when AT&T shuts down its 3G network, it will no longer be able to connect to AT&T's 4G network. Only the 6300 is listed as compatible. If you are an AT&T Customer you should NOT get this phone as a result.#2 - Even with an expansion SIM memory card plugged in, it only will use the VERY limited phone memory for text messages. So you're effectively limited to 8 MB of text messages - and any images texted to you have to be deleted immediately. This is the kind of problem that only becomes apparent after weeks of usage.#3 - While your audio reception is fine when on speaker mode - the microphone has real problems. Anyone listening to you while on speaker will have a lot of problems making out what you are saying as its very low quality audio on the microphone in that mode. So if its important someone can hear you clearly, you need to switch to handset mode.Also - a word of warning - the 225 does not support group/mms text messages properly. You can receive them, but can't reply all - only to the person who wrote the message. This is a common problem with feature phones, as far as I can tell - so if you are looking only at Feature Phones this shouldn't be a dealbreaker."
3516,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"I have a CDMA phone and needed a phone I good use when I traveled to Iceland. I wasn't sure what I was going to get, but I was pleasantly surprised.  We landed in Iceland and I bought a SIM card at the airport. We mostly used the phone for Google maps and to call hotels or Airbnbs, but it worked every time we needed it.  I did the same on a trip to Canada this past July and again the phone didn't fail me."
3517,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"I was able to get this 4G Nokia 225 Bar phone to work well for both my AT&T Prepaid plan and my T-Mobile Simply Prepaid plan with the following steps:Tip 1-Put in the SIM this way to get recognized:  Place the SIM in plastic side up/metal contacts down with the diagonal in the upper right corner, then slide the metal bracket slightly to the right to physically lock the SIM in (you will hear and/or feel a click) I had to use a tiny flat screwdriver(for glasses or phone tool) on the middle of the 3 holes to get enough force to click it into place. See pictures-tiny screwdriver not included.Tip 2-Power On: 2nd button down on the right side of the keypad. Hold it down and count for 5-10 seconds until you see ""Nokia"" light up.  Power Off: Unlock, *(asterisk), then same button and hold as Power On. (See pictures)Pros: The phone worked on both AT&T and T-Mobile in the Chicago, IL area of the USA.  It is lightweight and is just like the old Nokia phones of the past, but also updated to 4G for US compatibility(2021). It was priced low enough and also has Bluetooth to use my existing number/provider for calls in my car while I am testing the other provider's internet from my smartphone.Cons: I wasted a lot of time before figuring out the above 2 tips.My story: After an hour or more of trying and rebooting, I honestly thought my SIM was incompatible or that the phone wasn't unlocked to work with that provider and had spent an hour or more each, one evening and the following morning, before trying the other provider's SIM.  It was then, with a bright light shining a specific direction before seeing the instructions printed on top of the SIM locking mechanism. Afterward, I was able to get both provider's SIMs to work easily. See pictures-tiny screwdriver not included.I also had intermittent trouble getting it to turn On or Off before remembering my old Nokia bar and flip phones from 15+ years ago and that the button has to be Held Down for at least a full+ 5 seconds before it powers up-See pictures.Its been so long since I've worked with a sliding metal plate to lock down a SIM, and can easily see why other reviewers thought their loose SIM or non-existent service was the fault of a bad phone.Hopefully, the above 2 tips and pictures will help you, as they are either missing or not clear enough in the included paper instructions."
3518,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"I got the 225 for my teen daughter after determining she was not responsible enough for a smart phone. Bonus... She isn't always staring at a screen anymore. So, unintended win.The phone has worked great as a phone for the most part, and I didn't have any complaints. We use Mint, so cheap phone+cheap plan = win.Problems just started recently. I can no longer call her phone, it goes right to vm. She also can not call out. Texting works fine, but obviously a phone that can not be a phone isn't very useful. This may well be something with the network, but it's happening to a lot of people according to reddit. As of yet, I have been unable to find a fix. It has something to do with dropping volte. At this point, I'm basically stuck buying her another phone just shy of a year since purchase.Other issues included being unable to get more than a couple mms (they save to internal memory instead of SD card, fills fast and setting can't be changed) and text coming out of order.Great as a super basic device, but absolutely can not recommend since it's stopped doing the one thing a phone should be able to do."
3519,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,I needed an additional phone that will just be used for calling. Nokia met its brand quality. The phone fell down once and it did not crack. Other phones would surely have gone to tge factory.Value for money.
3520,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"Had to replace old nokia phone that was smaller but similar looking to this one  because of the dropping of support for the older phones. This one is not as easy for me to use as far as basic functions as my old phone.Bought this phone twice because I broke it right away, second one came with american charger and head phones so maybe they got that worked out.Battery life seems very good now but was bad for first few days after activation, tmobile prepaid.Still use my old phone as an alarm clock, just seems easier, wish they could have made a more similar replacement."
3521,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"I wanted a dumb phone. I want a no frills dumb phone that calls and texts with no Google, no annoying baloney apps that comes with smart phones I don't need that. I also love the Nokia brand, so for me, this was a winner. Everybody is right, despite being an ""unlocked phone"", this phone loves T-Mobile sims/network. Activating the phone, setting it up, it took to T-mobile with no issues. Having used old skool Nokia's, I felt right at home using this. The Predictive Text feature came switched off, and is a little more expanded from the earlier Nokias. Battery life is legendary Nokia, will last more than smart phones. Gone is that solid, thick plastic, brick feel of the early Nokias that were indestructible. The battery cover is very thin, and feels like you could shatter it just trying to open the cover. If you drop the phone, I'm sure it would be toast. The edges don't have that sturdy feel either. The drop-proof, kick proof reputation that Nokia had is gone. To counter that, i did buy an after market silicone cover specific to this phone.There's not much else I can add, this is a basic dumb phone that fits the bill.I hope Nokia keeps on with the basic dumb phone that lacks smart phone features. There is purpose and need for these type of phones."
3522,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,I have a twelve year old son who doesnâ€™t have enough impulse control or emotional maturity for a smart phone.  Most of the phones that arenâ€™t smart phones are 3g and are no longer supported.  You can use this phone with red pocket annual plan and basically get a phone and years worth of basic service for under 90.  The phone has a louder camera but it works.  Texting is old school style where you have to push through to the correct letter.  There are some games straight out of the 80s on it.  It is very lightweight.  There is a Facebook app on it but I disabled cellular data and got a plan with bare minimum data so I donâ€™t know how well it works but that may be if interest if you are getting this phone for an elderly person.
3523,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"We got this phone for an older family member who wanted a phone basically for calls and thatâ€™s it. It had good sound, and I was able to take hide all of the extra things she didnâ€™t want or need. BUT the display was low contrast and small, which made it very difficult for her to see the caller ID and contacts. If you were looking for a phone for a kid and didnâ€™t want to have a lot of bells and whistles, this is a good option. They wonâ€™t text much on it because there isnâ€™t a QWERTY keyboard. You have to use the phone keys for the alphabet. But for making and receiving calls itâ€™s great.One weird thing happened and that was that the radio came in and we couldnâ€™t get it to turn off. Haha. Probably user error."
3524,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,Good luck finding a prepaid carrier to do the BYOD on a feature phone without already having had service with them for 6 months. In other words you cannot start talk and text prepaid service with this phone through United Statesian GSM carriers.
3525,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,Hint. Go to an at&t store to add sim and activate. Don't waste your time trying to contact AT&T for service. I wasted hours on AT&T chat and phone and got nowhere.  Also note this is a VERY basic phone and be ready to spend time setting it up.  Speaker set a highest level not very loud for hearing impaired.  This phone was very cheap but works fine to emergency use as a phone.  I have an AT&T prepaid account with talk only for $25.00/quarter ($0.25/minute plan) which is all I need.  Negative is SMALL display and print also their automatic lock is a pain when you sign on.  But it's all I needed to replace my gophone (flip phone).
3526,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"I bought this to use it with my other Sim card since I need it for the â€œone time codeâ€ so this phone has no Arabic language, the text message will come as squares and dots, itâ€™s unreadable but in general itâ€™s good when it comes to the battery life and the size of the phone"
3527,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"I got this to ""disconnect"" while on vacation. It served that function, but the phone sucks a bit. I use Mint Mobile as my service provider with a Google Pixel 4a. There were no issues swapping the sim card. The Nokia recognized it immediately. After getting to my destination, it would drop calls. I don't know if this was Mint's fault or the phone. The timestamps of incoming texts were hours off, so messages did not display in chronological order. That made it hard to follow conversations. Sometimes people couldn't hear me talking. I'll keep the phone since it works most of the time, but I don't recommend it as a permanent phone."
3528,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"You all know Dilbert, the electrical engineer who is oppressed by the silly orders from his nameless boss.This is like that.My carrier is switching networks and I had to get a new phone.  The phone I really wanted on Amazon says that delivery could take till March.  So...Here are the essential features missing from this:* Predictive dictionary for texting.  If you have a small phone which can't have a QWERTY keyboard  it is still practical to text if you can press MNO - ABC - MNO and the phone guesses you mean ""Man"".*An adequate speaker.  This is amazingly weak at its top volume so can't be used hands free.  Well, unless it's Bluetooth tethered to a speaker.Loads of worthless features were loaded on:* It doubles as a 1960s transistor radio.* It has 2 cameras.  They could have left that off and used the space for an adequate speaker.* It has a browser for the internet.  Without a QWERTY keyboard no one can make that work.* It has Facebook.* It has games.  The thought that went into that should have been spent on a predictive dictionary.So my impression is the boss ordering the engineer to add a list of junk features and ignoring his objections that practical features are needed.  Y'now the stuff that Scott Adams cartoons about.And despite the ad above, NO, 4G does not give you clearer calls.  It's been 30 years since digital sound removed static from calls.Now it's time to tether it to the Bluetooth in my van.  I'm going to add a laptop to the van when I need to get on the internet and when I'm not in a wifi hotspot such as the parking lot of a big store I will use Bluetooth tethering to a phone.  This phone can at least do that."
3529,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"The warranty that came with this phone indicates a Chinese company is the maker, and probably has a license to use Nokia's name.  I didn't want to pay hundreds of $ to buy a smartphone when I don't use 90% of the functions/apps loaded on an Android device.  This phone came with a handful of pre-installed crappy apps (like facebook and several games) that can't be removed.  There is also a weird browser that couldn't connect to the internet, and there is no Wi-Fi so I can't check my Gmail.  The ""check for software update"" function did not work.  Texting requires several clicks to enter each letter of a word, and there are no word suggestions offered.  Creating a text message is therefore a ponderous task.  Buying this phone was a mistake and I will be returning it."
3530,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"The phone works as advertised. Not many bells and whistles, but perfectly fine for calls, texts, and fitting in my pocket.I ""upgraded"" to this phone in January 2021 from the old Nokia 3310 3G phone to address AT&T's coming discontinuation of the 3G network in Febrauary 2022.***While this phone is 4G compatible with most wireless networks, both AT&T and Nokia confirmed to me that this phone does not support ""HD Voice,"" which is a requirement to run on AT&T's 4G network.*** I caught on to this when I noticed my network coverage icon on the phone switched from LTE to 3G every time I made an outgoing call.If I had a carrier like T-Mobile, it would be everything I need. If you buy this phone, confirm that you will not be operating on any of AT&T's towers, or you will not be able to make an outgoing call. I have not confirmed whether or not incoming calls or SMS is affected."
3531,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"Good quality, user friendly. Simple phone that could probably be filtered easily. Especially popular in Israel."
3532,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"09/2022: This fix will no longer work, since the 3G bands were retired the phone can only make calls with VoLTE turned on.â€”The text message issue is caused by the device getting time and date info from the network. I was able to resolve this by turning off VOLTE (Voice over LTE) and then resetting the connection to the 4g network.1) Open settings.2) Connectivity > Network Settings > Network Type -> 3G/2G3) Back to settings.4) Scroll to the bottom - VoLTE - switch off for SIM 15) Back to settings.2) Connectivity > Network Settings > 4G/3G/2GYou will know you have done this correctly when the signal icon next to the battery shows LTE, but not VOLTE.So far, this has resolved it for me even after restarting the device. Best of luck.Update: itâ€™s been a year and itâ€™s still fixed and working great."
3533,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"I needed a low cost backup phone to have on me when I work on construction projects. I don't want to carry my smart phone on me when it might get dropped or broken (again), but I needed a phone where I can be reached if I leave my expensive phone in the truck, This works great as a backup, using a pay as you go plan, its very low cost with low usage. But if I run over it with heavy equipment, or loose it in a ditch, I haven't lost much.  It has been years since I used this type of phone, but I don't text or surf the web with it so it works for my emergency needs.  Keeps my daughter from looking for me if I don't answer the main phone."
3534,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"UPDATE: Something on this phone is using data in the background. I am not signed into anything, and none of the user-visible apps can remain active in the background. It is using small amounts multiple times every day, for a total of about 150kb daily. Nokia can't tell me why their phone does it (one of those non-removable apps? The ad network I describe below? User tracking?) and suggests I go into the network settings and disable data every time I am not using it! This is unethical in general, and really bad for a phone you might get to use on a prepaid plan with little or no included data.Original review:I don't need the web browser for too much on a phone like this. Google stuff, check news headlines, and occasionally open a confirmation link. But I do need it to be there which is why I got this model. Most other basic phones no longer have one.Nokia decided to use Opera Mini's proxy/compression browser (the ONLY one on the phone, there is no straight text browser). This is really cool, except for one thing. Opera mini now hijacks links on websites and redirects you to full page ads. I don't know how often this will happen, but I've had 3 of them so far. I checked the page info when the ad was displayed, and as you can see from the URL in the picture these are OPERA'S ads. Not the website I am on. Not a common ad network. I go to a website, click a link on that website which should link to a normal page on that website, and the browser instead sends me to its own ad system. When the ad is displayed, there is a button under it to ""continue browsing"". Clicking that (rather than the ad itself) sends me to a feedback page where Opera wants me to say why I didn't like the ad. Seriously, Nokia, I thought I owned this phone?Also, it's EXTREMELY slow at loading pages sometimes. It will just hang for a minute.Most of the phone's other features are fine, but this browser setup is just too yucky and creepy. It's almost like having a late 1990s browser infected with a virus."

3536,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,The phone died in the first 9 months of use by a kid. This is not a legendary 3310 that was indestructible.
3537,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,My dad wont use a smart phone. I got him this so I could switch him onto my plan. Activated the Google Fi sim on an old iPhone and threw it into this Nokia 225. Worked right away. This is a neat little phone. Bunch of pre-loaded games like doodle jump and snake. FM friggin radio that works fairly well. Comes with a charger and some cheapo earbuds. Camera is not great but its what you expect on a 50$ phone. Removable battery and SD card slot. Cant vouch for battery life yet since I just got it but seems OK. Call quality is OK. Only downside is it has a Facebook app that you cant uninstall.
3538,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"Itâ€™s a decent phone for the price. Sometimes it glitches, but overall it works!"
3539,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"Works good so far.  My old backup flip phone bit the dust and this was a good, cheap replacement.  Just popped to the Sim card out of the old one and put it in the new one and it did the rest.  Hopefully lasts me a while.  Separate line for my business number and calls but usually forward it to my smart phone and that feature works fine.  Very good buy for the money and Nokia is a reputable brand.  I've used their phones before and never had any issues with them."
3540,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"By default VoLTE was turned on for this phone, and that messed up text messaging AND broke the predictive typing for text.  Under the Settings menu you can flip VoLTE right off.  I had to turn the phone off and on again after doing that, then predictive typing worked again.It is unfortunate that VoLTE must be disabled in order for text to work, but if you just need a basically functional dumb phone, this one works fine after that.And also it worked fine for me on T-Mobile, no issues at all."
3541,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"Just what I was looking for! Hello user friendly telephone communication, and ""Good bye Samsung Galaxy!""I really liked the old ""Candy Bar"" style phones like my first Motorola many years ago. They are so simple to use without all of the over complex and unneeded features including touch screens. This Nokia fits all of my needs and I can always wait until I get home for email or sports scores.I am using this unlocked, bought new, blue Nokia 225, with a Tracfone mobile service using a Trackfone T-Mobile SIM card for my service area. No issues thus far with the reception and the voice sound is more accurate than it was during my short time with a Galaxy ""Smart Phone.This Nokia 225 has been great to have around with its easy portability fitting in my pocket, car door, and elsewhere just fine. I also like that it was economical in price, is light weight, and more rugged in design, but also has a somewhat retro but is modern look as well. An added bonus is it doesn't track my everyday moves like a regular smart phone does when activated."
3542,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"This phone transports me back to the days when smartphones were stuffs of fantasy. This one is the same old nice, small-sized, no-nonsense phone which can be used for normal phone calls. No demands, no complaints, no fuss. All you have to do is to just insert a nano-SIM card, go through the initial but compulsory settings and there you have the phone ready for use. I have been using it with my AT&T connection and so far, it hasn't given me any trouble --- which is exactly what I expected of it.Locking the screen is a bit tricky but once you have figured it out, you will just fall in love with the phone --- it's so palm-friendly and doesn't make you to glue to its screen, as you would have probably experienced with any smartphone. You may not be able to install social media apps like WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok or YouTube on it, but the phone comes preloaded with Facebook and its own browser.The battery life is just awesome --- far, far better than those of to-day's smartphones. The battery retains the juice for almost 5 days on the trot, even if you are using it on a regular basis, once it has been charged up to its max capacity. The phone itself is as sturdy as Nokia phones used to be before smartphones took over. To be honest, this little piece of a beauty has gotten an uncanny resemblance with the first ever Nokia phone I had!"
3543,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"This phone is nice looking, pretty, has a good camera but You will miss calls, it does not connect, or it takes a long time to get a dial tone.ex.

When I realized I had clocked more than an hour, I deleted the games. No point in replacing a zombie state of being with anotherâ€¦"
3546,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"The phone worked well, and did exactly what was expected of it other than a couple problems. For one, GROUP MESSAGING IS NOT SUPPORTED! The only way to make a group sms is through GroupMe. If you try to start a standard sms group chat it will just send the message to each person individually. And if anyone texts you from a group chat, it will look like the message is coming directly from them. My other problem was that sms messages were being received at a few hours behind the actual time. I think this was a carrier problem. My first solution was to turn off Voice over LTE, and that solved my problem for a few weeks, but then one day during my vacation in Hawaii it started displaying incorrect time stamps again, even though Voice over LTE was off. My carrier was US Mobile on the GSM network which is basically T-Mobile. Hopefully you have a better chance with it if your using it with AT&T or with T-Mobile directly."

I like the large screen and battery life."
3548,Nokia,225 4G,0.13 GB,S30+,2.4 Inches,"Call, text; and that's all I wanted in a phone.  T9 works, but not well.  Typing numbers is possible while in T9 either by cycling through your choices, or holding down the key, but holding down a key takes more than 3 seconds to get a number, and trying to type 0 (which you'd be surprised how often it's used) takes time; and for some reason enters all numbers prior to 0 if your next key press is a space (also the 0 key).T9 dictionary works sporadically.  Sometimes it remembers words/names you've taught it, sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes it does for a few minutes, a few hours, a day or two, and then has no memory of the word it was taught.The phone randomly freezes when unlocking.  The only remedy is to pull the back off, take the battery out, and put it back in.  It's not terrible, but it is really inconvenient.It can receive photos, but there is a size limit - you will get messages about the size being too big.  You can also only receive so many MMS until you have to delete them.  The answer doesn't appear to be giving it an SD card for memory, you can save your received MMS to the SD card, but if received photos are just taking up too much space on the phone, it won't download them. So, if you send/receive a lot of picture messages, know that you will have to move them to an SD card if you want to keep them, and delete them from the phone's storage."

I am a senior citizen and my husband is an ex-telephony electrical engineer.  With all this, one would think that the set up for this Nokia product would be a breeze.  Well, I wanna tell ya.....  After two trips to Best Buy and a few days of struggling on the internet for better information, we finally got the ???? thing to work.

3553,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"While this is a good, feature-packed phone with lots of memory, in my case getting the 5G service to work with Verizon was a long and complicated process.Verizon has a ""bring your own phone"" policy and indeed they set up my phone on my existing account no questions asked.  However, I shortly discovered it did was not receiving 5G service.  I had the phone for 2 months and was very frustrated with Motorola's lack of support for this issue, and of course Verizon washed their hands of the issue because they want customers to buy their own lower-memory version.  Long story short, I had to get two different SIM cards from Verizon before the phone worked on 5G - although it did work on 4G LTE just fine all along.  I'm still not sure if the issue is with Verizon or with Motorola, but in the end, the phone now receives 4G and 5G service, supports WIFI calling, has a ton a built-in memory and is expandable with a micro SD card.  It also has a headphone jack for those of us still using wired earphones.  The camera is just OK, but that's fine for my needs.It's a good value and a good phone, as long as you can get it up and running properly."
3554,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,The phone is great. Photo is fantastic in my opinion. I think it better than iphone quality.  The extra 256 gb sd is a plus. It lags sometimes but a reboot fixes it. Bought a second one as a gift for my aunt who wanted the extra space also. The stylus make it almost like a Note. I play genshin and path to no where with no issues.For the price point. It beat most phone for me. If you compare it to a iphone or Samsung premium device. Just walk away.

The battery life is excellent even after gaming and watching YouTube TV. The sound is great. I have not tried the camera yet. The finger scan on the side is strange to me. I will adjust. I wish the sim card and SD card had separate slots. Trying to put them in with stubby fingers took awhile. All in all I give this phone a 10. Oh yes Alexa is so happy on my new phone. She ignored me on her echo. Okay. Thank you Motorola and Amazon.

The 8/256GB version of this phone does just that.  It's almost a direct replacement for my Note 9 - better camera, worse stylus - with a larger battery and updated Android.The camera is good enough for my needs, and better than my old Note's. Also the unlocked version of this has the bands for FirstNet service included. AT&T only sells the 128 version of this phone in their shops, so this is a better phone for only $50 more at the time of this review, and you get 4X the memory ( 256 internal and a 256 SD card)."
3557,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,Advertised as 5:12 GB phone but is actually 256 for the internal drive and 256 for the SD card they included. Other than that it is an awesome phone and I would recommend it to anyone
3558,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"it's speaker is quieter than my moto G 2020.  it's not BAD, but a shame because i HAVE to have this at max all the time.  i used to be able to go to another room and i could still hear this.  but now, i HAVE to have this with me, next to me all the time.  not sure if i'll be able to hear this in from my pocket well playing on speaker.the screen is bigger and better, but screen isn't everything.edit: lowering this 3 stars.  it is not a bad device, but in pretty much all regards except for screen it is worse than my previous device:- while this is brand new, it's battery is lasting just about as long as my 3 year old 2019 moto g8+- the ""vibrate only"" is quieter than old device, i can't even hear it- loud speaker is quieter, which i didn't realize was such a huge, huge requirement for mein all major ways i use it, this device is worse than the one i'm replacing it with.  but i don't know how i would have measured or searched for those things on a site.  i don't know what site measures loudness or vibration of a cell phone.  oh well, i will have to learn.  glad i bought it on sale."
3559,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,I do mobile gaming and this is a good phone to do that with. It's fast and has enough power to game. If your into gaming on a budget. Other than that it's a good phone. 5g in my area is not so great and I can't disable 5g via the phone. But I don't use it as my primary phone. Edit 11/8/22. I figured out how to disable 5g. Works much better now.
3560,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,Phone and charger get very hot when charging. Phone gets hot when using certain apps.
3561,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"This is a great phone for the price. It doesn't have a bunch of bloat ware. It sucks that they removed the stereo speakers but, I think it still has good sound and I love the ease of the Moto gestures.I've only had this model for a day so I've only watched one YouTube video on it. The picture looks great with the refresh rate set to auto. It came with a 256 gig card already installed. I'm with Metro by T-Mobile so I used the MyMetro app to switch the SIM card from my old Moto stylus to the new one. It was very easy to do. The fingerprint reader works fast but I did find it kind of difficult to set up. It kept saying it only read a partial print. Try again. Now that it's set up, it works great. The facial recognition was way easier to set up. It works fast, too. It's a great mid-range phone with nice features. I would recommend to a friend."
3562,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"One of the biggest cons of this phone has to be the screen brightness. If the screen brightness was just brighter it would be a much better phone in my opinion. Also the processor it's not capable of handling multi-purpose, but the battery life is we're this phone will shine."
3563,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"Overall a good phone, but part of the reason I purchased it was because it would have 5G.  For some reason, Motorola decided to hold off on 5G certification with Verizon and AT&T until later when there ""might"" be a software update.To be fair, the LTE reception was excellent, but part of the reason I paid more for this phone was because it was supposed to include 5G.  I believe the software update will happen, but Motorola is notorious for delaying OS and security updates with their Android models, and thought it best to look elsewhere."
3564,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"I only bought this because it's from AMAZON (a retailer we trust and support heavily) and the price was fantastic.  The Canadian price was over double including shipping, taxes and exchange.  First, a nice, study, and big phone so far. its fast and with 8g RAM and 256g Internal storage it's a decent size for multitasking.  However, it's very heavy and bulky.  It is NOT a full stylus machine ala Samsung Note- there are no spreadsheets/Excel, or productivity software to use it with.... It's just a big phone with a stylus you can jot down notes (and with AWFUL handwriting quality)  and do some doodles with.  That's it.  You're best to add $400 and get the Samsung Ultra Note  and get a PROPER Stylus productivity machine... not a ""pretend"" one like the MOTO 5G Stylus (2022 version). Or better yet, the MOTO Edge Ultra... no fake stylus but a powerful machine for a great price."
3565,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,Love this phone. The only issue I have is the camera. I think there is a software or firmware issue. It does not focus well and if you do send a photo the aspect ratio makes them appear smushed. I hope they plan on fixing that.
3566,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"I've given up on wasting money on flagship phones.  I don't play games or use the camera as a professional photographer - so while this phone lacks those niceties, it does everything else perfectly. Crisp clear screen.  Minimal bloatware. Stylus works well.  Oddly, I'm not able to get 5G to work yet.  Bluetooth is far better than older phones. Motorola features are best in the business. Has an actual headphone jack. Great value when on sale."
3567,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,I am using this with Tello and everything works as expected including 5G. I did run into issue where microphone was fading in and out. Caller on other side could not hear me at all. I thought it's a hardware issue but it's not.The issue actually happened due to app and data copy from my old LG phone running android 9 to New moto Stylus 5G 2022. (I used USB-C to USB-C cable) Some old app was taking over microphone. I had o factory  reset moto stylus 5G 2022 and manually installed apps from play store. Everything works beautifully now.Do not copy app/data from old android version to android 12. I guess android 12 to android 12 would not be an issue.Overall this is an excellent phone so far.Update 08/10/2022Added 5G support info from Motorola site for others.Note that this phone have single SIM only and comes with 256GB built-in storage plus 256GB factory installed SD card. You will see SD card when you install the SIM card.
3568,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"If it weren't for the mono speaker design, I would have given this 5 stars for every other aspect. I feel like making a model that plays in stereo and removing that feature was a baby step backwards. Everything else makes my Moto G Power look whimpy though. The stylus is very nice and extremely precise. Although I fear I will lose it eventually. There is an option to have the phone remind the user when the stylus is not replaced so maybe that will save me?"
3569,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"I'm not sure what is wrong with the battery on this phone.  I start the day with a full battery.  By 8 p.m. the battery is at 25%.  This is worse than the phone it was meant to replace.  Most of my apps are not up and running.  I haven't had time to really start using it, so my concerns about the battery is troubling."
3570,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"Works well, no problems, good size memory, happy with my purchase."
3571,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"This is my fourth or fifth Motorola. This is the most expensive one I have ever purchased and the least impressive. The touch screen loses functionality at the edges. Battery life is nothing to write home about. The Bluetooth is quirky and the phone needs to be restarted frequently to pair with my cars, Fitbit to and earbuds. Randomly texts and phone calls don't come through and it freezes. The camera is okay. Doesn't seem much better than my G7. The color is beautiful. It's a pretty phone, but that's about it . I am really disappointed. It's going back, just gotta figure out what I am replacing it with."
3572,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,Personal use and work.
3573,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"So far so good. 120 GHz refresh rate is perfect! Everything is speedy fast,  lickety split! And the fingerprint reader works really well despite its small size on the side. The only thing I would change so far is at another speaker. There is only one at the bottom of the phone and my last phone, also a Moto g stylus had dual speakers, top and bottom, which I believe the sound was a bit better.The battery takes longer to charge than my last Moto g stylus 4g. So far it lasts a little longer, so that's the upside. Otherwise, so far it's a great phone and I love the seafoam green color! It glows! ğŸ¤ "
3574,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"On June 30, 2022 I was upset that I couldn't find Alexa on my Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G 2022. She wasn't built in like they said and I had wrote a long anger comment about it. But I discovered that in the comments section of the Moto Voice for Alexa App that's not compatible with this device that the Amazon Alexa App now let's you use Alexa hand's free with the app. You have to download it from the Google Playstore and walah! You've got Amazon Alexa hand's free! So basically for whatever reason, the Moto Voice for Alexa App hasn't been updated and no longer works, but users who want to use Alexa just have to download the Amazon Alexa App and setup the Alexa hand's free option and that's it! So I apologize to Amazon and Motorola!"
3575,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,Phone is great I bought it to remote play for my Xbox and it's perfect for on the go gaming. Camera not to fantastic because it light hits you right it will give you grey hairs. Battery life is pretty well had 3 hrs of gaming and caught it at 50 % still. Cheap and reliable phone. Honestly does every I need it to. I'm a gamer so playing games on it it's pretty smooth.
3576,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"Overall, very happy. set up was easy but a little time consuming. Just install my ting sim card and follow prompts. Voice clear, 5 G good but not as fast as I thought it should be, even at 5 bars. No dropped calls from fixed location. Suggestions for improvement: cable from microUSB (old) phone to C new phone; drop the need for enter on keylock sign in; and a stylus extension. The stylus extension is needed when the phone is in a case and I use a stylus to put the stylus away."
3577,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,It's quite a nice cover with a gloss finish but I ended up returning it's associated phone so had to return this cover as well...but it's a good cover for the Moto G Stylus 5G 2022
3578,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,Saludos la memoria micro SD 256 GB y el lapiz capacitivo no estaban en la caja. Necesito me ayuden con esto lo mas pronto posible porque estare en par de dias en otro pais. Agradezco de sus buenos oficios
3579,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,I wanted to like it.  But the screen had a yellowish dirty tint to it.  I've noticed that about Motorola phones.  I bought a Moto One Ace from Best Buy and it had a yellowish screen.  I returned it and bought one from Motorola and it had a much better screen.  I think it comes down to look whether you will buy one where white looks white or white looks yellow or beige.  Then the camera would not focus. I tried to take a pic of a door 6 ft away and it kept trying to focus and never did focus.  Then one of my wall same thing. So yes I returned it because it was inferior to my other Motorola phone.  6-19-22 review on the Stylus 5G 2022 i bought from Motorola its much better then the one I bought from Amazon.  Luck of the draw or Motorola sends borderline in spec displays to Amazon and Best Buy?  Not sure just theory.  One thing for sure the Seafoam Green is beautiful I love the color
3580,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"Stylus is a fun and useful feature since writings can be shared quickly, responsive screen"
3581,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"Like the 256gb, internal drive space, 8gb ram, physical size. Would like longer battery life."
3582,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,Love this phone. Just take out your stylus wherever whenever and write a note!
3583,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"I am not happy with this phone at all! The sound when speaking on the phone is full of static, even though I have full bars. The quality of the pictures is terrible. Even with standing still and focusing, the pictures are often blurry. The one good thing about this phone is the storage capacity."
3584,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"I owned the 2021 Moto  G Stylus 5g, which was advertised as 6gb of memory, and 256mb of internal storage.  So I see the new ""upgraded"" moto, when I turn on the phone I see that Motorola scammed me by just sticking a 256gb memory card in the slot I normally put my 1tb card in, so, you are really buying a phone with 256gb of internal memory.  Thats why I paid the price I did for it, it's a great phone, not sure why they felt the need to fudge on the internal memory specs.  Seriously thinking about returning this.  I kept the phone and now several months later the microphone has stopped working, having to return since still under warranty."
3585,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,Great phone for the money
3586,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,Nice phone so far
3587,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"I hate this phone. To big. To bloated with useless crap. Often hard to sync with blue tooth items. Poorly thought out design. But of course by the time you realize you hate it , it's to late for a return."
3588,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,This phone has endless bugs. It takes nearly all the provided 256G for itself very quickly. Poor speaker which is mono. I got refurbished amazon renewed Pixel 4a 5G instead which is incomparably better than this...My credit for return has not yet been issued two weeks after it was received by amazon. Now amazon customer service is using a specialist department that supposedly handles the refunds which are higher value (this is only $350 phone...). I wasted over half hour with customer service today. They dropped my first call and did not call back... If you want this kind of customer service give amazon business... You can get the same. I'll try to avoid giving amazon pricey electronics business if I can buy it elsewhere like bestbuy. And I'll generally speaking try to buy things elsewhere to not have to chase amazon customer service... The amazon returns is made into a customer loss in cases like this. This is totally inappropriate and unacceptable to me..
3589,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,En uso normal con un poco que se mueva el telÃ©fono escuchan entrecortado y si hablas en alta voz no entienden lo que uno habla mala calidad de micrÃ³fonos y va para un mes que devolvÃ­ el producto y no me hacen el reembolso aun.
3590,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"Complete trash. Haven't been able to talk on the phone without it being on speakerphone the entire conversation. So much for privacy. Calls randomly go to voicemail, texts don't send, the ghost touch is insane. In fact, I've been going insane since having this phone. Now it all makes sense."
3591,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"Although I like the stylus, the processor is slow, the charging is slow, battery use goes pretty quick.  And AT&t 5G doesn't work.  But it is a really pretty phone."
3592,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,The microphone quit working on my phone and I can only talk on speaker phone. Very inconvenient and I'm really disappointed ğŸ˜.
3593,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,My earlier Moto Gs (several) worked fine as far as giving me email and news notifications. This 5G Stylus does not give me any email Inbox notification until I open the email app. Some news notifications work fine. What a disappointment. I tried all different things with Settings/Notification with no avail.  Does anyone have this issue? I hope to find a solution because I don't want to return it after all the work to translate everything from my previous phone.
3594,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"I love everything except the fingerprint reader it just flat-out will not work. My last Stylus worked perfectly this one gets stuck and never finishes the reading. The camera is awesome, screen clarity top shelf very easy to transfer my stuff to the new phone. It is a little bit bigger screen. My old one the charging port wore out so I know you can replace them but I was due for an update that phone never let me down either. 512megs is also awesome."
3595,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"I got the product and it worked well as a personal organizer/office tool (pen helps, makes notes easier/faster), but battery not good -dies with or without using for 2 days.I bought it as AT&T treated my Redmi Note 9 Pro (working great before) as a PREPAID LINE about 9 months ago while the sim has been with me for about 4-5 years on a postpaid plan, now I can't make/receive calls. I bought this Note about more than a month and when I used the new Sim Card that they provided, still not working. AT&T not good!Amazon should buy AT&T so that customers can enjoy a very good customer service that we enjoy with Amazon!"
3596,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,I usually have a long term relationship with my phones. This phone is magical and I forsee that it will last me a few years! Great value and lots of neat features.
3597,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"Slightly taller. Faster. Now with NFC for Google Pay. Still with headphone jack. Crazy offer with free additional SD card. There are more expensive phones for sure. But I've been buying a new Moto's mid-range phone every 2 years, and I've been able to keep up with current Android OS releases, and get upgraded cameras, and other goodies (NFC this time). The price is so attractive, that I can upgrade more often than my family with their iPhones (to me, I'm sold on the expandable memory and much better battery life over time)."
3598,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,"as a newer phone, it's okay. not bad, but no good either, the 120hz screen is nice, the 8gb of ram keeps it zippy. but the phone will be left outdated software wise very quickly. and to be honest some of the details on the phone itself were lacking. NOW: on arrival it worked great out of the box, but within two days there were software issues. freezing, notifications not appearing, and closed apps re-opening on phone unlock. overall quite disappointing. I guess I see now why  it was marked as low as it was on prime day. in my full opinion, issues like this make a phone unusable, especially as a replacement bought for a broken one anyway. I've requested a return(07/26/22), it has been picked up, but no update on the refund process otherwise from amazon. WILL SEE"
3599,Motorola,Moto G Stylus 5G,256 GB,Android 12.0,6 Inches,This phone is a sturdy well made phone. The features and camera are pretty good.
3600,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"I've had every Google phone dating back to the Nexus line, only getting maybe 2 of them brand new.  I've always purchased used, year-old models from Amazon or eBay as I'm not the ""need the newest one"" kinda guy I was back in the mid-late 2000s.  It's been a mixed bag of results, as I've received some great condition phones that were only listed as ""good"" condition, and some clunkers that were listed as ""excellent/like new"".  For example, the Pixel 3XL I purchased on Amazon a few years back was listed as excellent but had a large scratch on the screen that my fingernail could get stuck in.This Pixel 5 was in the best condition that I've ever received a used phone in--no blemishes or scratches, even under very close examination.  I'm very happy with the purchase.As for the phone itself, despite a few gripes, it's a solid entry in the Pixel lineup.Pros:-The battery on this is the best I've used, possibly ever on a smartphone.  It lasts all day no problem, even under heavy usage.  I'm frequently left with 30-40% battery when I go to bed, which is fantastic, especially for a used phone.-I love that they brought back the fingerprint scanner.  Even though it's ""old tech"" it works so much better than the face unlock I've had on previous Pixels.  Others may disagree, but this is my favorite unlock/security method to have on a phone.-The camera is great.  While it may not have the snappiest photo processing, it does take a great picture.-I really dig the green color and am a fan of not having a glass back.  I always seemed to end up with cracks, even with a case, on my glass-back phones.  Sure this back is plastic, but it doesn't feel super cheap--it has a tile-like feel.-There's no wasted front real estate. It's got an edge-to-edge screen, so no forehead or chin that would make the phone unnecessarily larger.-While this is a person-to-person, carrier-to-carrier issue, on my Pixel 4XL that I bought used from Amazon, I was locked out of WiFi calling on that device by my carrier.  I read that this happens to some AT&T customers when they purchase a preowned phone.  It took me MONTHS of contact and threatening to switch carriers to get that finally activated.  No such problem on this phoneCons:-I've always had the XL models of the PIxel and they did away with that for the 5, so this is smaller than I'm used to.  And I kind of miss the larger size.-Not super wild about the left-aligned hole-punch front camera.  I think I'd rather have it in the center.-While I did mention I like the edge-to-edge screen, the sacrifice for this is having the front speaker hidden under the glass.  As others have mentioned in reviews for the Pixel 5, this is noticeably a worse sounding phone than my 4XL, and probably a few generations before that.  Overall, the sound is disappointing.-As this is a review in 2022, as of now it just seems like the Pixel 5 is a forgotten entry for Google and aftermarket manufacturers.  Sure there are still plenty of cases and accessories that are compatible, but I've found that a few popular case manufacturers don't make Pixel 5 cases anymore.  For example, I have a leather Bellroy case for my 4XL that I loved, and wanted to get one for my 5.  I look on their site and they have the leather case available for the 2, 3, 4, 5a, and 6--not the 5!  And when I contacted them to ask about it, they said they will not be making any more and ""tend not to reproduce older cases as they become obsolete very quickly"", which doesn't make a ton of sense since cases for older Pixels are available on their site.  I've noticed a few other manufacturers not having Pixel 5 cases as well.Overall I really do enjoy the phone.  It's in wonderful condition and the battery life helps reduce the sting of the small gripes that I listed above."
3601,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"Remember that kidâ€™s puzzle game where you put a circle in the circle, square in the square, etcâ€¦? This phone is on that level. But for the fingerprint reader on the back (the only reason I bought this particular phone), there is literally nothing about it that Iâ€™ve found to be geared towards adults. This phone is Android - I just donâ€™t know what part. Itâ€™s as locked down as an iPhone. It should be called iPixel.1- no mobile settings in quick settings menu. I didnâ€™t even know there was a phone made without this vital feature.2- abysmal cell reception. Even the 10yo Nokia flip-phone I used to use got better reception. I live on the edge of town so I donâ€™t get great reception to begin with (I donâ€™t expect more than 3 bars), but my ancient Nokia and Samsung phones got at least 1 or 2 bars - so much for improved technology. I donâ€™t even know what a bar looks like on this one yet. (note: I was in town at the store today and got what looked like 2 bars - now I kind of know.)3- app folder (#1), is arranged alphabetically, and while that's mostly how I want it, that's the only way. Even if you want to reorganize itâ€™s not possible.4- app folder (#2), not allowed to create/organize into folders. They say it has that function, but not on my Pixel 5 it doesnâ€™t. When you open the app screen, every single app on the phone is listed alphabetically, but the phone does not allow for creating folders to organize.5- battery percentage is nowhere to be found unless you want to clutter your screen with a huge ridiculous widget.6- as to the widgets, itâ€™s as if they were designed by and for small children. Big, bulky, colorful, and basic. No information on emâ€™ and nothing to modify, kinda like a Tonka Truck.7- texting. Iâ€™ve had the text window just vanish whilst in the process of typing a message on 3 occasions (all 3 were somewhat long messages, one of the times I wasn't even touching the screen, I was just rereading the message before I sent it). And yes, I had to reopen messages and start all over.8- swiping. It requires astronomically more patience than I have. Twice Iâ€™ve actually lucked out and gotten a â€˜swipeâ€™ to pull up all of my open programs the first time, but the norm is 4 or 5 swipes - max 13. Even when you do manage to get it to open in less than 5 swipes, accomplishing your objectives is head-scratching slow. You have to swipe up - hold your finger there for 1 second - then release - now you can go through/close your apps 1 by 1 only. No option to close them all at once.Maybe Google has fixed all or some of these issues with the Pixel 7 OS, but I doubt it - theyâ€™re notorious for not fixing anything with any of their products (I knew that when I bought this phone but I figured Iâ€™d give it a try anyway - fail). One thing I do know, if you're a Samsung user and you're looking for a phone with a fingerprint reader somewhere other than on the screen, consider this one out of the question, you will most certainly not like it (maybe the 6 or 7 is better, who knows). It's ultra basic, locked down, few settings/preferences, and awful reception - it's as-is. No idea what to get now."
3602,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"Overall a great phone for the price. I use T-Mobile prepaid, swapped in the sim card and it was up and working within 20-30 minutes with everything updated and transferred.Only giving 4 stars because the earpiece speaker was blown, and it will need replaced.Other than that, great phone for the price."
3603,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"Phone works fine and the battery life is great, so it's probably a fresh battery. Only complaints are some minor scratches on the side (which are covered up by a case), and that the eSIM is still locked to Verizon. The regular SIM slot still works fine with my carrier in the US, but it would be nice to be able to use the eSIM instead.This phone may not work if you're in Mexico, based on other reviews."
3604,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"Works fantastic and looks almost new. There were minor scuffs on the edges, but my case covers it completely. I've had the phone for a few weeks now, and it arrived unlocked in the foreign country I reside in and has had zero issues. The camera is perfect for what I wanted. I'm someone who doesn't need the latest phone, but it's new enough to serve my needs."
3605,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"I wanted to upgrade from a Pixel 3a to a newer version and chose Pixel 5. I assumed that because the phone was newer, the front and back cameras would definitely be crisper and better quality than my older phone. While the back camera produced sharp images, the selfie camera was appalling-- super blurry, very little definition, and just way below par. I did some research and apparently the Pixel 3a is one of the last ones to have autofocus cameras on front/back, while the newer Pixels only have fixed focus. The only solution I saw offered in Google forums was to just hold the phone further back at 16 inches in order to get a clear selfie... Not really a solution in my opinion. I use the selfie cam for a lot of pics with friends/family so this aspect was important to me.After more research, I ended up purchasing the Galaxy S22 for comparison and have decided to keep that phone instead. It's approximately the same size as the Pixel 5, uses Android operating systems, and has autofocus cameras on front and back that are AMAZING. The camera app also has a TON of bells and whistles like a cool video feature called Director's Cut where you can simultaneously film with the selfie cam and back camera to show what's happening in front of you while still talking to the screen to narrate. After a few days of use, I'm blown away and think the S22 is a much better choice for people who value sharp and defined selfies."
3606,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,Got mine unlocked and not attached to any particular service provider. The battery lasts me roughly all day if charged fully.The finger scanner works like a charm. Wish they kept that hardware on the newer pixel phones.Has only freezed on me once. Don't particularly care about camera quality so I won't comment on that.
3607,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"We travel extensively and wanted a spare phone so we can be up and running with a new phone immediately if something happened to our main phone. We have a Pixel 5, which we bought new as soon as they were released. We will probably be upgrading phones next year and the Pixel 5 works perfectly for our needs and didnâ€™t want to spend a lot. So we bought this refurbished Pixel 5, exactly the same as our other, except in the Sorta Sage color rather than black like our other one, so we could easily tell them apart.We have had it just about a day, but so far it works perfectly. It looked like new when it arrived. We updated it and installed all of the apps. We also installed an eSIM from Airalo, so it has full data capabilities. We can use Google Voice for calls and text. So we have a high quality, fully-functioning phone for $300, with no long-term contract, credit check, etc.We are trading in a Pixel 4a that we were using as a podcast and music listening device. With that, our total is less than $200.When Google stops updating the Pixel 5 software, we will look at buying two refurbished phones of a later edition the same way."
3608,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"My Pixel 5 (from 2020) is ""like new"" which means I never would have guessed it was used. No scratches on the screen, no observable blemishes on the body, and battery life seems to be great.I bought this phone because my note 9 suffered a pretty bad crack in the screen recently. I've had the note since 2019 and was always a little disappointed in it's size - it's too big. The Pixel 5 is so small in comparison! I can carry it in any pocket without feeling like I'm carrying a literal brick around.I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I would recommend the Pixel 5, the Amazon Renew Program, and this seller to anyone."
3609,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"For many generations, Google has skimped on some of the details with their phones. They do have some of the best cameras, and also because Pixels use the base version of Android unmodified by the other manufacturers (i.e., Samsung's Touchwiz interface), updates to Google Pixels come much faster. But in an attempt to build ""flagship"" phones at lower prices than the competition, Google has been notorious for cutting corners. For example, the Pixel 3 and Pixel 4 both got low ratings due to small batteries that didn't last much past lunch, or for limited RAM.On the Pixel 5, they put in a good battery and decent RAM, but went with an aluminum housing instead of glass like the competition, and they used a step-down microprocessor rather than the top-of-the-line chip in the competition. It's that slower microprocessor that's earned this phone most of its lukewarm attention, but I'm here to tell you, for 99.9 percent of us users, the chip they went with is still plenty fast and capable.My previous phone was a Pixel 3 that eventually the battery pretty much just bulged until it burst out of the case. It never had good battery performance so I was constantly keeping it charged (hence the battery exploding), and I ran into some issues with crashing because there was only 4GB of RAM. But otherwise, it was a solid phone that I enjoyed a lot. So when it was time to upgrade, I went with a newer Pixel. But my budget didn't allow me to go with the shiny new Pixel 6 Pro, I had to settle for a refurbished Pixel 5. And I'm here to tell you, I don't feel like I've compromised one bit in that decision. This is also a good phone, which fixed the things that were broken about the Pixel 3. I like that, unlike the Pixel 4 and Pixel 6, it has the fingerprint sensor on the back, similar to the Pixel 3 - right where my index finger intuitively finds it every time I need it. I find the phone plenty fast - the step-down chip keeps up with all I need it to do. I kind of like the aluminum case; it's not as slippery and easy to drop as phones housed in glass. It's a good solid performer all the way around. And even though it's refurbed, it feels completely new.Want a great phone but don't have a lot of bucks to spend on the Pixel 6 or a Samsung Galaxy S22? Get a refurb Pixel 5 and don't look back."
3610,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"This phone makes great photos.Actually,It makes grainy photos, like any other camera, but it's google AI advanced software that will make the picture look 'picture perfect'.Portrait pictures look like they're made from a $1k DSLR camera.In the dark pictures are clearer than with the naked eye!If I take pictures of a dark closet that looks black to me, the camera can still see things inside the closet.The 2 cons would be:1- Small battery. Though battery life is acceptable (not great, but not bad either), it's a far cry from modern phones with 4000mAh batteries.2- The phone is rather small for modern day people. I feel it's ok for people with small hands, like 5'4"" or smaller people, but if you're 5'8"", you'll want to go with the larger version.No complaints so far, because my wife loves it, but I went with a Galaxy A72 myself.The price of this Pixel 5 is more than the A72, it's a smaller phone, and battery lasts less long; though the Snapdragon 765 (pixel 5) does have a slightly better performance in both single core, multi core, and gaming benchmarks than the Snapdragon 720G (Galaxy A72), though the difference is minor."
3611,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"The phone itself is pretty good. It gets kinda hot during use. The camera quality is excellent. Fingerprint reader is lightning fast but sometimes it fails to read my finger.There is one pretty huge complaint I have though. The listing is incorrect. This is a Verizon branded phone, meaning the bootloader is locked and cannot be unlocked whatsoever.Given that Google is nuking support for this phone in about a year, that makes this thing a ticking time bomb. I am ashamed of the seller for not mentioning anything about it being a Verizon variant of the pixel 5.I wanted to unlock the bootloader to put a custom ROM but I will not be able to do it on this device. A custom ROM would mean that this phone would be supported for a very very long time (possibly decades). Truly disappointed, and I'll probably return it and get a generic model from another listing.Modders beware."
3612,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"I was worried it wouldn't really be unlocked based on some of the reviews here, but I decided to try it out since we get 90 days to return if anything.  Went to Cricket and successfully activated - hooray! Waited to order my screen protector and case until I knew for sure.The phone literally looks and feels new. If you look closely, the screen does have some very light scratches, but once I put the screen protector on, you can't see them at all. I'm so glad I went for it. It came with a charger, but I found it charged very slowly, so I just am using my same charger from Amazon that I used for last phone.I was able to transfer over most of my apps, contacts, and messages from my previous phone (galaxy 9) within about 15 minutes maybe less. Super easy, the phone does all the work for you. I love that the only apps it comes with are google apps, most of which I use anyway. I also noticed it has pretty good battery life. When it first arrived, I charged it and left it on (although didn't really use it at all) and that charge lasted for a week and 3 days before I went to Cricket to activate. I charged it that Saturday night and used it a considerable amount to transfer/ setup everything to my liking, did some Amazon shopping, note taking, little bit of Youtube and Spotify. Now it's Monday noon and I'm still at 44% . That far exceeds my expectations. The phone itself lives up to all the spec descriptions and has been easier than I thought to get used to navigating. The only thing I miss from my samsung s9 is the LED notification light, but I can get used to that. So glad I was able to get my hands on the pixel 5, I think it's so much prettier than the 6 and it's practically the same size as the galaxy s9, which is perfect for me.This is a great value for your money. There are a lot of cheap phones out there, but I think this one is on par specs and feature-wise with the more expensive flagships. Overall, highly recommend.If I don't update this with negative feedback in the future, that means I'm still happy with my purchase!"
3613,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,Better than I thought.
3614,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"I think the fingerprint reader is a step back from the Pixel 2 I had, but all else was good. Bought used and fulfilled by havEarly. Good phone aside from Google's missteps on the fingerprint reader."
3615,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,I'm not sure if it was just bad luck but if a phone is advertised as being in excellent condition I would expect no cracks in screen. Return was only a little hassle though.
3616,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"Appears and works like a brand new phone.  Only exception is you don't get a factory charger and cord.  But, what I got was perfectly fine."
3617,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"I was promised an unlocked phone, and its with verizon. cmon now"
3618,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"Fingerprint reader on the back of the Google Pixel 5. Is much more convenient than having to use the front screen like on the Google Pixel. 6. I own the Google Pixel 4 a for over a year and it was such a good phone and maybe want to get the Google pixel 5 so I very happy with the results I've been getting so far from the Google Pixel 5 with the larger screen and I'm looking forward to see what the future brings. It has a very good camera built into it. It's a very high quality phone with high memory capacity and I utilized the fact that my Google pixel 5 came to me delivered unlocked. So I used my 5G SIM card in it and it's been working well and getting good coverage. Not quite as good as the Google Pixel 6 with T-Mobile service, but I see it being highly likely that the performance will improve as five Jeep it proves and the phone becomes more cohesive with the SIM card.Franklin M Bosia"
3619,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"Spotless device, all as it should be.  It was Unlocked, as advertised, unlike another one I purchased from another seller...Not much else to say - at least I feel like I should be reviewing its ""refurbished"" state more than the qualities of the Pixel 5.  That said, I like the phone a lot and think it's an excellent buy at these prices.  Very happy.My one disappointment is I'm running a battery tracking app (AccuBattery) and it's suggesting, from early measurements, that my battery capacity is 87%.  I was hoping that this was a returned unit, barely used, and the battery would be pretty mint.  That said, I don't know what values a truly brand new unit would show.The battery arrived 47% charged - which is a good thing.  Storing at half battery is the right thing to do.  Not sure if that's random chance, or if the seller is doing this."
3620,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"Received my Pixel 5. It looks new and came with charger which looks very similar to my pixel 3a charger. battery is very closed to the designed capacity (4080mAh). Now the only issue? Screen gap. There is visible gap (or separation) at the middle right of the pixel 5 I got.If you read enough review of Pixel 5 you might know that some Pixel 5 phones have screen gap between screen and the metal body. Google did an investigation and claimed the gap is not a design flaw and would not impact IP68 rating (of course they would say that). But Google did mention they will address the issue with individual customer. My guess is that Google exchanged the phones and sold those to 3rd party vendors so they could resell the phones as ""Like new"" hence that's what I got. After some debate I decided to keep the phone as I don't want to go through hassles of exchanging a renewed phone (with extra damage protection warranty purchased) and I have a feeling the exchanged one probably will not be much better. So keep your expectation at a reasonable level ..."
3621,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"Begrudgingly had to upgrade my Pixel 3a because Google doesn't support it anymore, and the Pixel 5 feels both the same, and new. This renewed version is in perfect condition and it was super easy to migrate all my apps and data. I don't notice much difference from the 3a other than maybe some more smoothness and snappiness while changing apps. A pretty logical upgrade and I'll be very happy with it for the next 2-3 years."
3622,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"Phone was listed as unlocked. When put in new SIM card, found that the phone was locked. Could not use phone. I to contact the carrier to have them unlock it and it took over 15 hours for them to unlock the phone."
3623,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"My reconditioned Pixel 5 128GB from Edge Cellular has been perfect for the past 3 weeks. There was only slight wear on the back from laying on the charger, you really have to look for it.  If it weren't for the low price I'd swear this is a new phone. I updated to Android 12, not a single issue. I love the 90hz refresh rate. It's like staying in a nice hotel or flying first class, you can go back to coach, but now you know what you'll be missing.  The size fits perfectly in my front pocket, but I find myself making more typos with my fat thumbs. My Moto would die by the end of a single day, where this can go 2 full days. I would have given 5 stars, but I must use battery saver (not a real problem) and if I use maps or watch videos, I must use extreme battery saver.  4 stars is still pretty good.  I highly recommend this phone and especially Edge Cellular.  Go for the green, people really seem to like it.Update - 7 months later and everything is still working great.  I gave up on battery saver, but I can go all day and recharge at night.  Great phone!"
3624,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"Phone is definitely what I've been looking for. My only issue is no matter what update I've done or how many times I turn the phone and/or Bluetooth on and off again, it will not connect to any Bluetooth devices. Can't listen to music in my house, can't link up my Fitbit. Nothing. It's very frustrating. Dealing with it as my other phone broke but just stinks that I can't utilize every aspect of the phone. If you aren't a Bluetooth user though, I would definitely recommend this phone. Lightweight, lots of storage (I got the 128gb one) and for a renewed product, it works like new (minus the Bluetooth ğŸ¥º)."
3625,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"Good -Got a refurbished unit with no scratches on the screen or camera glass.Turns on, opens apps and camera with no noticeable slowness or glitching.Easy to use with one hand, not slippery, fingerprint reader works without thinking about it.Bad -The camera clicks and buzzes while moving around, I'm not sure why. It might be that stabilization is not functioning correctly?There are vertical stripes of light on the camera, both before and after a photo is taken.Overall, I feel like I got pretty lucky with a scratch-free unit, but I'm wondering if these other issues are in every unit."
3626,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"I've been using my Google Pixel 5 for a little over a month now, and it's working just like new. I was a little skeptical about buying a ""renewed"" phone, but this one works great and was much more affordable than a new phone. It had a small scuff on one of the bottom corners of the exterior plastic of the phone, but all the glass was intact including the camera and with my new case on you can't even see any damage at all. T-Mobile was able to transfer everything from my old phone and start up service exactly the same as the last time I bought a new phone. Also, I'm glad I've had the option to return it within 90 days if something was wrong or goes wrong - I like that piece of mind. Overall, this was a great purchase and I would definitely recommend to others."
3627,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"It's been a week and for the most part, I'm loving this phone. Its fast, zippy, great battery, awesome camera.So why did I give it ""3 stars""? Because I paid for a ""good condition"" refurbished, that says in the description that it has no screen scratches, but mine sure did. Right in the middle! UGH.Since everything else is perfect (so far), I just put a screen protector on it, so I wouldn't feel it."
3628,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,OEM Unlocking not possible.
3629,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"Pixel 5 arrived only two days after I ordered it, four days early.  It was indeed in excellent condition -- no scratches or nicks anywhere that I could see, even with a magnifying glass.  I threw on a screen protector and a case to keep it that way.  It works great.  Not plugged in, it still retains 80% power into late evening.  I do a mix of email, texting, listening to music, and general surfing.  Jim S."
3630,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"UPDATE: I'm updating my initial review. The seller quickly responded to my issue and sent me a label so that I may return the phone. Still bummed the phone doesn't work, but I appreciate them making the process easy.The phone looked totally normal on the outside, but it just won't turn on. I tried using different chargers, holding down every different button, to no avail. The return company explained that I can return it, but I need to pay to send it back.Complete waste of time and money. Save yourself the headache and get a phone elsewhere."
3631,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"I am conflicted.  My current phone is janky and does not last me more than 1 hour after being fully charged; this Pixel 5 just arrived but there is visible screen damage when the screen is on, but it is small.  It just does not fall within the description of having no cosmetic damage visible from 12 inches or more.  Additionally I do not know if it may get worse.  An additional noticeable but non important issue is that the G on the back of the phone is damaged.I do not know if it was worth the time to return or if it is worth the risk of keeping the current one."
3632,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"I love this phone, almost everything is perfect at this price. The fingerprint sensor could be better and the battery life is not ideal (which I think is due to it being refurbished), but overall it's an excellent experience.However, the reseller forgot to clean the charging and speaker holes, and the cable and charger included are so bad that my phone takes an unexpected amount of time to charge. I think that the customer service can definitely be improved because these are the details that make clients happy."
3633,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"Came in, in perfect mint condition. I can't tell it's a refurbished phone at all. I was worried because of some of the reviews but I guess the sellers uped their game. I'm switching over from a Google pixel 3 (not pink) and the sage is very mute but stunning. The battery life is far better. I will say the camera *seems* less impressive than the 3 but I'm not too disappointed in it. Screen resolution is fantastic and the 90hertz display is swift and a noticeable upgrade. The screen and back phone has no scratches or dents. The phones once arrived will need to be updated to Android 12 as they are on 11, but in my opinion the update is glitchy and isn't needed so I was kind of happy without it. Fingerprint scanner is quick. Buttons are clicky but I will say, not as clicky as the 3. Not disappointed though. The whole punch display isn't noticeable and the extra screen space is nice!Oh! But the speakers are probably a small con as they are located at the bottom of the phone so they're easily blocked and aren't as loud as the 3."
3634,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"Phone came unlocked and ready to set up out of the box just like if i bought a new one. Performance of the phone is great and has longer battery life than my Pixel 2 XL that I just upgraded from, and had since it came out. Plan on keeping this one for a while just like the Pixel 2 XL because my Pixel 2 XL didn't have a scratch or an acre or anything on it since it came out and I purchased it. This one has a grade higher screen glass than that one. Sellers started shipping it as soon as it was ordered. Getting a 5G smartphone for under $500 is a great deal, compared with the specs of other phones in the price ranges, that just came out."
3635,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,Love this phone.  Arrived in excellent condition.  Only issue is the phone audio is pretty bad.  The speaker phone works fine for phone and music.  But when using the ear speaker the tone is very flat/muffled and takes a lot of getting used to.
3636,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,The charging port has had some issues.
3637,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"The refurbished phone was fine, and as advertised, although the package did not include the dongle that is required to transfer data and apps from my old Pixel to the new device, which it obviously should.  My big ding is that the selling promise appraised my returned device for an $85 credit, but when I returned it, they re-appraised it at $0, and I got no credit, despite the fact that I had answered all their appraisal questions honestly (the phone had no screen damage, powered on properly, and all components worked; yes, it needed a new battery to replace the swollen, dying one, but that's the only thing that was wrong with the phone).  The trade-in process was a big, bait-and-switch, lie."
3638,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"I love this phone. I upgraded my iphone7 to this, and I'm super satisfied. I've had it a few months now. No issues. The battery saver helps to keep her going all day long. I wanted a good camera, but was unwilling to dish out for the iphone12 or better. My photos are HIGH quality shots now with this pixel. My only complaint is the night mode takes too long to shutter so I can't capture action shots in low light. The portrait mode makes up for what lacks everywhere else. I can continue my photo obsession in style. Highly recommend."
3639,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"Less then 2 years of use... battery runs out very quickly, to the point I need to charge it every 2 hours...also speaker broke.I love the clean android software but Google needs to significantly improve on it's hardware choices."
3640,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,Is thin. To receive phone calls
3641,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"Compared to my old phone, this one is so fast and responsive. Many great features that make life easier. I couldn't even tell this was refurbished. It came in total packaging with charging cord and a tool to remove the sim card from my old phone and move it to this one. No complaints, I am really happy with this order!"
3642,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"Phone was delivered promptly with no name charger, screen looks like new no scratches, very functional, good deal. Battery lasts about15 hours with limited usage"
3643,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"There was only minor damage to the plastics which was good, and the screen is perfect. But the battery is around 50% of original charge capacity."
3644,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"This is great phone, good battery life etc, camera is also great.My one fret is that Amazon says renewed devices look and feel like new, ths was close to new but there were a couple light scratches on the screen, no stress either way as just about everyone installs tempered glass protectors, I'm just noting it for prospective buyers.Woud I buy another Amazon renewed phone? Yes."
3645,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"The phone screen was in good condition, but there were scratches on the back of the unit.  It was not as new from arms length on the back as condition is stated on Amazon.  The phone also had not been factory reset.  Thank fully the prior user used no password, as otherwise it would have been a paperweight. I was able to navigate by feel even though I couldn't read the settings menu and find the reset functions.Updated 3/3/22The battery appears to be run down as well.  I asked the seller if they could refresh the battery but they say they tested it.  I'm not sure what to make of that, but I don't believe it's true that this battery is up to 80% of OEM capacity"
3646,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"Visually you cannot tell that this phone is not brand new. I was fortunate to get one that wasn't previously a Verizon device so it had an unlockable bootloader and I was able to install privacy and security oriented CalyxOS successfully. Works great. The audio quality is good, screen is very clear and sharp, seems to be a durable phone, like the smaller size.My only complaints. It's kind of cheezy to send a phone without at least a clear silicone protective case. I will say that the USB cable included was of good quality, as it supported the transmission of the CalyxOS image which not all USB cables manage.Only time will tell if it proves durable."
3647,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"I bought this phone out of despair - I owned Pixel phones for 4 years now and I needed a new one. My Pixel 4 has cracked, and I was excited to get Pixel 6, but when it arrived, it was so big, heavy and bulky that I returned it. I even tried IPhone for a couple of weeks, but I was missing a lot of Android features which I had no idea Iphone is lacking. So, decided to give this phone a try as I didn't want to pay $800+ for a brand new Pixel 5. And I glad I did! Yes - the phone came without original box and charger, but I have plenty of those. Other than that it looks and functions like new - the battery lasts me 2 days! Overall I am very happy with the phone and I saved quite a bit of $$$"
3648,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,I had the original pixel back in 2017 so this is a huge step up from that! Iâ€™m an Apple guy but this (or the Pixel 6) would be the phone Iâ€™d have as my daily phone if I didnâ€™t have the 12 Pro Max. Absolute beast of a phone especially for the price
3649,Google,Pixel 5,128 GB,Android 11,6 Inches,"I don't use the fingerprint reader, at least not yet.  The set up was partially done by Verizon staff member, and then eventually I finished it.  It's easy to view and use.  I'm hoping that it will be just as good as the brand new Google Pixel 5, and last a long time."
3650,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,Seriously  good phone Just few issues storage more folders & apps need option to be backed up with SD cards. I keep getting notifications that my storage is close to full. Only had phone 1mth. Never had that issue with my Huawei(Love that Phone). Second the power button why did u change thats too annoying go back to the side button Please! 3rd. finger print does not respond correctly  most of the time especiallywith screen protector. 4th phone Sound ehhh.  Keyboard on phone. Ugly. Along with text messaging. Bring back music ring tones Capable with Spotify or other apps we pay for the music mthly 4. The Good Camera quality  is great. I also Love the FREE Samsung TV app included.
3651,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"I was looking to pickup a budget phone around 3-400 dollars. When I started doing some research, I noticed this deal, where I could get a top-of-the-line phone from 2 years ago for less than half price. Spec-wise, this device is equivalent to the s22 ultra with very minor exceptions (EXTREMELY minor, like camera and variable refresh rate).Comparing this device to all the current budget phones from Google, Apple, Samsung, Nord, Moto, TCL, etc., this device seems to be the best value for the price. Between the refresh rate, battery, AMOLED HDR display (boasting 1400 nits of brightness) , stereo speaker audio, 12gb ram, security/software updates (for at least another couple of years at the time of writing), this phone is absolutely killer.The refurbished part scared me at first, as I normally buy all my devices new, but I have no complaints here. My device genuinely feels brand new.My only complaints about this phone are mostly personal problems rather than the phone being faulty. For example, I kind of hate how clear the front-facing camera is. I may need to get new glasses or something, but the picture is more detailed than looking in the mirror. When I take a selfie, I see all the disgusting blemishes in high detail (I'll work on being less ugly, but regardless, it maybe something to note if you take a lot of selfies, you may need some software to blend the photos a little better).Another complaint is the jarring effect of the main camera trying to switch focus. I don't take very many pictures, but if you're trying to take a fast picture, that might be an issue.The display does not allow for 144hz and 1440p at the same time. It's kind of a bummer, but I'm just excited to finally leave my 60hz life behind.Opening a couple of games, this phone performs extremely well, but I did find it odd that it did not allow for higher graphics options on games like Genshin Impact or Diablo Immortal, since it defaulted these games to high graphics rather than highest (not that I play waifu simulator or Diablo Immoral, but I did need to benchmark my credit card somewhere).Lastly, this may be just my shipment, but the cord did not work for transferring data from my old Note 8 to the S20. Fortunately, you can transfer everything wirelessly, and the cord I got works for fast charging. It's just an odd issue worth noting.Overall, I'm extremely happy with this device. I don't normally write reviews, but here I am writing a book on my experience with it, so maybe that's a testimony in itself. Hopefully this helps someone on-the-fence about picking this one up.Edit: this was purchased from Edge Cellular"
3652,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,The first impression was excellent its looks like new phone . The phone is totally unlocked everything is working fine but i see a Little bit scratch on camera side but its not bothering Also camera is not as like new one when i do zoom more than 20x the picture is not clear sometimes. But overall i do recommend to buy
3653,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"Pros - Looks and works like new.  I confirmed that it is indeed unlocked.  It is a Verizon phone but now working fine with a T-Mobile sim card. ğŸ˜  Yes, the S20 Ultra is truly an outstanding phone, especially the absolutely fantastic optical-zoom camera. Results are stunning!  Even handheld 4K videos are gorgeous and oh so stable, even in windy conditions.  The S20's speakers are also excellent.  They not only have great sound quality but great volume as well.Another compelling S20 feature for many of us is the beloved MicroSD card slot. It allows up to and including 1TB cards.  If you're considering the S21, sorry, you're out of luck as MicroSD is MIA.Cons - None that I can think of except for the usual Samsung bloatware."
3654,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,The finger print reader on the phone is really fast and the battery life is amazing knowing that the device is refurbished I had it for 2 months now and the phone is incredible its fast and its good for the price I paid for it!
3655,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,En realidad dude mucho en comprar un telÃ©fono renovado tenia miedo que no funcionara ... pero me equivoque al recibirlo me quede maravillada es un telÃ©fono en excelentes condiciones es nuevo!!!! Todo funciona excelente le instale el sim de verazon llame a que activarÃ¡n mi nÃºmero y todo fue excelente y supera sencillo estoy encantada hasta el momento con mi telÃ©fono es hermoso ğŸ’œ ğŸ’š ğŸ’• y funciona al 100%
3656,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"I am loving this phone! It looks and works flawlessly and you'd never know it was refurbished.  The fingerprint reader can sometimes be a little finicky, but that's probably just the phone and not because it was refurbished. Also, the phone is on the large side so pay attention to the dimensions if you don't want a giant brick in your hand. :) Overall, I'm extremely satisfied."
3657,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,So far the phone is working right out of the box it's looks brand new for a refurbished phone
3658,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,Nice phone. Reconditioning looks great.
3659,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,Phone is great but the charger died within the first week of use.
3660,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"Arrive quickly and in good shape. Looked like new. It appears to work well and is a good value for an older generation phone. However, the camera keeps crashing....and crashing...and crashing.  I will update this if it is addressed by the vendor.... and if it isn't.  I have run all pertinent updates to attempt to remedy the issue. No luck so far... careful.Vendor vwry quickly swapped out phone.  New one works as advertised...."
3661,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"First off I searched this phone and there was absolutely not one nic or scratch in it anywhere. 100% works and looks like a brand new phone. It came boxed very well for the trip and with all the necessary accessories to use it (Super Fast Charger and cord, type C headphones, sim tray tool.) I would recommend this company and the phone to anyone and ğŸâ¤er's..ğŸ˜€"
3662,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"I bought this phone and when I first switched it there wasnâ€™t to choose Russian language or Ukrainian .That phone was bought for my mom and she doesnâ€™t know English. I returned it and asked refund , but it it's been 3 weeks and they haven't refunded me."
3663,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"I love this phone. I think the battery life is very good. Like that it takes an sd card, unlike the s21 and s22 ultra. Camera is Great. Works with straight talk, transferring my stuff from my older LG V20 was very simple. I would not hesitate to buy this phone!!"
3664,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"recibÃ­ el telÃ©fono, liberado y como nuevo. sin ningÃºn rasguÃ±o. habÃ­a estado leyendo los demÃ¡s comentarios donde algunos no tuvieron buena experiencia, pero me quise arriesgar. todo sin novedad!"
3665,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"This phone from Chubiestech worked.  However the problem is that it came from a manufacturer that did not allow it to switch from 5G to 4G easily.  Consequently, when 5G was not working, the phone would slow to a crawl.  We got another one from a different vendor and when we went to the settings, we saw that it could switch from 5G to 4G."
3666,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"This is a PHENOMENAL phone.  It took me a week of research, looking at hundreds of phones, before finally settling on this one.I care about the following in a phone1. Replaceable battery and ability to use battery case2. Removable storage that supports AT LEAST 1TB3. Bluetooth 5.0 or greater4. Ability to interface with lots of other devices through multiple interfaces5. Processing power, and ability to reduce to save battery6. Battery life7. It has A camera8. Sufficient internal memory to handle many apps simultaneously9. Support for numerous transmission bandsNo phone out there checks all the boxes as far as I could tell. I would not want most of them if they were free. This one has all but a replaceable battery, and there are aftermarket battery cases that make it a non issue for at least a few years.One might think the S22 would be a better choice because it is newer, but it does not support adding a micro SD card, so that disqualified it from consideration. With phones, newer is newer, but often not better. Verizon is trying to get me to trade in my S20 for an S22. It is a good offer, but I do not want the S22. Maybe the S23 if Samsung engineers put back the card slot, but they probably won't. This phone is plenty fast with latest Android, so good for 4-5 years."
3667,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"Love this phone! HUGE upgrade from my pixel 4a, the only thing my pixel did better was scan the fingerprint quicker"
3668,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"I got this refurbished to save, and am not disappointed. The phone appears to work and be just perfectly fine. Maybe there's a couple tiny little signs of wear if you really look at it under a harsh light, but I bet 99 of 100 people would assume it was brand new when I pulled it out of the box.Fantastic value for money"
3669,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"El celular esta increÃ­ble!! Sin ningÃºn rayÃ³n ni nada, increÃ­ble pedido!! Lo recomiendo"
3670,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"Thank you for sending this good phone. About the product, should I say a word, It is Samsung Galaxy. I liked it. I prefer androids over the iPhone though I have to use both!"
3671,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"Albiet the price can change since it is an Amazon Refurbished phone, I was able to get this for about $480 and is a purchase I will not regret making. Not only did it arrive a day early, but the condition it came in was as if it was practically new. It has some small scratches arround the camera bump and a single small scratch on the screen, but aside from that, this is more than acceptable for the fact that this is a $1400 phone for only about 1/3 of the price."
3672,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"LlegÃ³ a tiempo, la caja tenÃ­a todo lo que se suponÃ­a tambiÃ©n. El telÃ©fono se ve completamente nuevo si rasguÃ±o .EstÃ¡ completamente desbloqueado, simplemente puse mi tarjeta Sim en ella y estaba casi listo. ActualizarÃ© mi reseÃ±a si encuentro algÃºn problema."
3673,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,Thos phone lasted and was great when I had it.
3674,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"I have had all sorts of phones, from Motorola, Nokia, LG, Samsung and iPhone. I am GC and am very hard on my phone. They get dropped, coffee spills, water spills, paint, all sorts of crazy things get on it. Now with the danty style of today's newer phones with the gorilla glass and high tech this and that, I need a bullet proof phone. I need one that can get dropped, with out breaking, works when I do and as hard as I do. I have always had mediocre luck with Samsung phones (my last one was a Samsung Galaxy 7 Edge so a significant upgrade since then, what's that been 6 or 7 years? My last phone was an iPhone XR) so I have high expectations that this phone will last a long time. After reading reviews after reviews I think I made a wise decision. The only problem that I have found so far and it's no fault of the phone, but the screen protectors, front and back, they are absolute trash. They don't sit on the phone well at all, the fingerprint scanner doesn't work with with the sub par screen protectors. I will have to keep looking, if any one knows a good one shoot me a message."
3675,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,Excelente conditions. Phone is like brand new. Recommended
3676,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,It works perfeck in Albanai. But if iu use it in usa you have to unlock it. Just call tthe company of your cell number and they will give you the code.
3677,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,Came on time box had everything it ws supposedtoo . It's completely unlocked simply put my Sim card in it and was almost good to go. I'll update my review if I come across any issues.
3678,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,Phone works great! No scratches or dings!
3679,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,There were no major issues with the phone and the seller fixed the one smaller issue. This phone takes beautiful pictures and I love it.
3680,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,The phone was in Mint condition... all you need to know! No problems
3681,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"The first thing I noticed when unboxing this phone, reconditioned by Avant Solutions, was no charging cable in box and wear marks on phone, already dropping it from like new to good condition.  It turned on without difficulty, and connected to my internet, seeming to work as expected, but then it was time to insert and activate a sim card.  There was no sim card insertion tray in phone or in the box, just a hole in the phone for one, so I sent a message to Avant Solutions requesting a charge cable and sim card tray and sim removal tool, supposed to be with phone.  As I proceeded to set up and test other features, I soon found that the finger print sensor would not record my finger print, no matter what I tried.  Password and numeric code would unlock phone, but finger print would not, nor would it record my face for facial recognition to unlock.  There was no screen protector on phone to interfere and screen was clean.  Online trouble shooter from Samsung showed that finger print sensor and screen proximity sensor were not working at all.  At that point I sent a message to Seller, Avant Solutions, through Amazon, requesting return for refund on this Item.  While Amazon approved the return, Avant Solutions sent a message wanting me to go through several proceedures to increase screen sensititity, which I had already tried through samsung trouble shooter.  Avant Solutions was sent a third message informing them of this, and reiterating the missing item.  They did not respond at all to my first or third message, so item was returned with Amazon Authorization and refunded.  never got an opportunity to test phone or text functions."
3682,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,Item came in fast. Packaged expertly. The only Issue is the charger they sent me did not work. Other than that fantastic seller
3683,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"Compre este celular por que es de gama alta y esta. Muy bajo precio, aunque es reparado, parece nuevo, estoy muy satisfecho con esta compra, les recomiendo comprarlo al 100%."
3684,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,Excellent condition and works perfectly!
3685,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,Looked nearly new. Screen was scratch free. Battery lasts all day. 5G works great.  Great value compared to new
3686,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,Good phone
3687,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"I had to upgrade from my Galaxy S8 after the 3rd screen replacement - totally my carelessness.  I resisted because it's such a hassle to transfer all the information and settings to a new phone and learn how to use a new phone...not to mention the expense and environmental impact. Setting up this new phone was a breeze and everything is EXACTLY like my old phone, just bigger! It came packaged well and included a charging cable, outlet box and the tool to eject the SIM card. I took my T-mobile SIM card out of my old phone, put it in my new phone, connected the 2 phones and followed the directions. I've been using my new phone for about a month and couldn't be happier. I would recommend this renewed phone to anyone looking for an android upgrade."
3688,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,Battery life is good.Faster.
3689,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"La mejor opciÃ³n que pude haber escogido, desde que lo recibi asta ahora no ha fallado en nada todo bien y se instalo perfecto a mi compaÃ±Ã­a..."
3690,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,Fingerprint reader is not consistent.
3691,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"For the most part the phone operates just fine. It's less quirky/glitchy than the S9+ it replaced. The biggest issue I have is the speaker is blown, so speakerphone conversations have an annoying rattle.Battery life is terrific.Given the price, I'm not too upset with the purchase. I'll keep it since I believe this is the last model to have a micro SD slot."
3692,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,This is my 2nd S20 Ultra.  I dropped my previous one and broke it.  I loved it so much I wanted the same phone.  So I purchased this renewed one.  The screen doesn't always work.  Which is very frustrating.  I'm guessing the screen was replaced during the renewed process because it doesn't always work.  Frustrating.
3693,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,This is are 2nd phone in the s20 line that is not working keeps saying no Sim card which means you have no service its a problem with the board and has to be replaced at this price and all the headaches of fighting with insurance to replace your phone maybe should look at other phone options also have an s20 plus that has never been dropped and in a otterbox and the glass on the back of the phone shattered inside the case not sure how that happened not very durable
3694,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,No me agrado que me llego rallado de la pantalla
3695,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"You can't tell it's not a new phone, not a mark on it, functions as new."
3696,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"After less than 2 months, this phone won't take a charge! I've tried different cables from different brands, and they're all very hit or miss. So frustrating bc it takes forever to get a new phone set up like you want, only to discover it's junk! Shame on them for sending out a broken product and not quality checking better!Camera is much improved over my S8, but it's still nowhere near the iPhone 12 pro max. These Samsung cameras lighten photos too much (remove too much black) so they are unrealistic and don't match the colors and tones seen with your eyes. And low light pix are still pixelated/low quality. Night mode doesn't always help. And the pro settings are a joke.Battery life would be fine if I could charge the phone when needed!Lots of trouble with screen mirroring adapters to fire TV.No more unlimited hotspot like on my S8, thanks to some Samsung or AT&T (not sure who to blame)."
3697,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"My product I recieved caused me so many days of headache on the phone with customer service and phone carriers for days on days trying to figure out what is wrong with the phone, it appears to have came carrier locked despite it being advertised as completely unlocked. Caused me many instances of distress and concern, spent over 20+ hours in my local wireless store trying to figure out was was wrong before inevitably having to cave and purchase another phone so I would not be without service was any longer. Would not reccomend."
3698,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"Great phone, with super battery life.  Display is crisp with great color range.Only issue I've had is that type 'C' usb charger will plug in either way, but only charges when plugged in a particular way.  I have to really look at it and make sure it's charging in order to know whether I'm plugged in 'correctly'.  Will probably paint one side of charger to keep it working.  If I've got it right, it charges VERY fast!"
3699,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"Me agrado en su mayorÃ­a todas las caracterÃ­sticas del celular, mi Ãºnico disgusto es la pantalla que se curba en las orillas y si no tienes un cover es molesto"
3700,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I just received this phone so I will give an update in time. So far its not bad. I had a A51 before but dropped it in water (for like second!) and the screen went black. So I got another one because I really like the camera feature. The only thing I have noticed so far is that the battery does not last long like my first one. My first A51 which was brand new, could go 24hrs and a little bit longer, no problem. This one starts to drain at the end of the day.So other than that, it's still a good one, so far- for it being refurbished.  Just don't drop it in water!! Oh, and I use Straight Talk but planning on switching to Pure Talk in the future. It works fine with Straight Talk."
3701,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Works perfectly hubby loves it enough storage for his 1 million games and all features worked perfectly from the second it arrived and it was shipped quickly would definitely buy again if we need another replacement any time soon
3702,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I did order this phone because my father in law needed a new one. So we got a pretty good deal on a renewed one. It's perfect for him... good battery life, enough storage and big screen for his needs."
3703,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Works excellent with StraightTalk... no setup required for service (just basic phone setup), I just plugged in my SIM and it worked. Didn't have to mess with access point settings. Great features, camera, interface, everything... battery doesn't last as long as I'd hoped but still better than old phone."
3704,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"It Came 1 week earlier. Phones in good condition, Couldnt ask for any better."
3705,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Phone came with a scratched back which isn't an issue but the screen response time is sometimes slow or nonexistent. What I've been finding more infuriating is the removal of the universal regular emoji button. I dont even use emojis very often but its frustrating to only find them after multiple steps because samsung wants to push these idiotic stickers that you CANT REMOVE. I just hate options being taken away for no reason. Ill give it a week but I'm probably going to send this back for the s10+ I got last time and just be careful to not drop it on its edge onto a metal beam shattering it. This is ridiculous and annoying.
3706,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Battery gave up after a year
3707,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"The phone is great. I've had it once before this purchase, so I already know the perks of it. (Here's a picture I took from the camera) Great quality! Battery life is great! I purchased this same phone from here to have a backup one. I've had it for about a month, had no issues with it until one morning the phone alarm woke me up and I couldn't turn on the screen to cancel my alarm. The screen went black. I haven't dropped it or anything so it's not physically damaged. There's some type of internal defect in the phone. I know the phone is refurbished so I knew there was a chance it would have an issue. I'd give it another chance because I really like this phone."
3708,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"The phone is downloaded with every possible media app  Facebook Netflix so forth and you cannot delete them only disable and Samsung software tries to take over the phone constantly with the reminders constantly trying to get you to use their photo app there messenger app  It's so bad that if you need to do a factory a factory reset that is extremely difficult it required a call to Samsung to get assistance... The phone is not user friendly You almost need to be a Samsung expert to expert to even use it.  Considering the issues I believe this phone is overpriced Samsung needs to stop with the bloatware or at least allow the option to delete the apps from the phone I don't want Facebook or do I want Netflix at least allow me to remove them.  Also I was using pure talk and due to the 3G shutdown issue  At 1 point I was unable to access my data on my phone after repeated contacts with pure talk they were unable to help me so byer beware if you are using this phone with AT&T or one of cell services that use their towers.  From my experience AT&T Is not handling the 3-D shutdown very well, avoid AT&T related service aided services it was a nightmare on a side note any attempt to contact AT&T is pointless if you are using one of the other cell services they will not even speak to you.  they offer no or very little support on this directly It forced me to go to a different Carrier"
3709,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Don't use face recognition. Battery  does not hold up but about  a half a day
3710,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,This is an excellent phone. It was unlocked. It is unbelievably powerful and full of cool stuff. Believe me when I tell you that it's definitely a must. Way nicer than my S9. The price just can't be beat
3711,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I bought this unlocked Samsung A52 because I could transfer my current phone plan/Sim card over to this new phone. I have had the exact same phone that I got through straight talk for almost 2 years. Unfortunately I had dropped it and it landed face down onto the driveway and cracked my screen pretty bad and i found the best deal on Amazon thru this store for the exact same phone I had. After 2 days of use, it would freeze up on me, I had really poor sound quality if I was talking on the phone to someone, and if i put the phone on speaker to try to hear better, it muted the call on my end so whoever I was talking to couldn't hear me. I tried everything possible to figure out why, but I never did find out what caused it. The camera quality on my samsung A52 through straight talk was pretty decent considering it was a prepaid phone, but the same phone ( unlocked samsung A52) that I ordered through here was complete garbage. I couldn't focus on any image no matter how far or close up I was. The macro  option wouldn't focus on anything either. If i would try to record a video of anything, it would glitch within 3 seconds of recording and same there was a camera error and then the phone would power off. I paid over $240 for it, and could only use it for 3 months before it powered off in the middle of it charging one day, and it hasn't turned back on since. I thought about returning it for a refund of my money, but I was past my return policy time frame. Of course. Over all I am completely dissatisfied with my purchase."
3712,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Buried in the specs you can see that this is a 2G phone. It has all the nice features of a Samsung modern smartphone, but connecting only at 2G speeds, it is unable to run large applications such as Google Maps effectively on the road. It was very disappointing when I recently traveled to San Francisco for leisure and the apps were lagging big time. I don't think anybody should buy a 2G phone today."
3713,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I love the phone, great camera, clear calls, etc., but one of the three that I bought stopped just stopped working after about 10 weeks. Get a warranty."
3714,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Phone does not work with net gear modem. Can't get on the internet
3715,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"It was a ""knock off"". It was a Huawei made from China. I called but only offered refund minus the gift card, and no phone.The phone did not fit the spec, the software may have possibly been the cause of the malicious performance,  but ai still have been unable to find a resolve"
3716,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I was forced to change plans so I opted to buy a new phone. I purchase this phone, a refurbished copy of my last phone. The refurbished version was actually better than my old phone of the same type. It must have been a newer version.The refurbished phone I received looks newer than the phone from the previous company, which I purchased new. The A-51 seems to process things a wee bit slower than my older phones. I had a Samsung S-10 a few years ago and it was faster at processing, but I like this phone."
3717,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,i am grateful for it. i received it yesterday and have been using it since.The camera quality is superior and the finger lock works.I am having trouble with the face recognition and it gets hot sometimes but it works fast and I am having no problem logging in all my accounts.There are visible scratches and the charging jack looks a lil dented as well as the noticeable dust in the edges and speaker jacks but i can clean it myself.

3721,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I purchased this phone because it was compatible with my cgm and insulin pump. The phone is a little slow. Every time I power it off and turn it back on it goes to a weird  reboot screen. I'm always afraid it is going to shut down. I think it has to do with how they unlocked it. I'm going to purchase a new phone. If you are someone that depends on your phone Don't buy this, it's not stable."
3722,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I already knew about this phone because my mother purchased a few month ago. My Note 5 is old so I had to choose and upgrade into another android phone.Despite of many bad reviews on this page, I don't see any problem so far. This phone came with 'unlocked' as they promised, works with Verizon, and also having sim card tray.I thought I would reuse my sim card (from Note 5) because both phone are using same nano sim card (as I know), but Verizon staff said that was for old 4G network, so I purchased unto a new one at the store.Anyway, today is a third day for using and A51 is still working fantastic without any issue. I like all the features including quad camera and already fell in love.I hope you could find great seller for this phone."
3723,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Nice looking phone. Looked really nice. Seller was super to work with.
3724,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,It's a great phone takes nice pics and it's very clean no scratches..sometimes is happening to the signal tho it does not pick up in some areas even when my other phone picks up..but other then that it's a great phone .
3725,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,No finger print recognition and night photos and videos is not that good must be plenty of light
3726,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Battery life is great. Great value for the price. Overall performance was excellent.
3727,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"This phone keeps shutting off while using apps, it's fully charged 60 % or higher. Today it was charged and at 75% but shut off as I opened the weather"
3728,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Performance very close to Samsung's top of the line phone.  Great value for the money!
3729,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Phone used 5mo since Dec 14 2020: It is very fast, lots of features, easy to use. Favorite feature is the thumb print access. A number of reviews complained about setting up the thumb print and once set up, it did not work consistently! I found that the process only captured part of my print the first time so I repeated it moving my thumb around a little each time until the entire print was captured. Saved it, and it has consistently worked almost instantly (1/4 second) every time. Place the CENTER of the thumb on the center of the icon either vertically or horizontally (doesn't matter). No difference with or without a screen protector. I use a Hatoshi case that includes a screen protector."
3730,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I love my use/ new phone  looks very  clean
3731,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"The product is working properly, exterior not scratched and works properly. It has ghost marks on screen of a radio player stays on screen all the time. I wish I knew that before."
3732,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"not even a month of use the screen goes black, not gonna order from here again"
3733,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Well, I clearly LOVE this phone since this is the 3rd one I have bought! (I have a tendency to drop & break screens!). In my opinion, there is no better phone for your money, in the market.... It has sooo much memory / storage & it's relatively fast & I don't see anyone who buys it, to be unhappy w/ their purchase! Samsung did it right w/ this phone for sure!! ğŸ˜"
3734,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I dislike the dents at the product charging system and unexpected scratches at the back cover.
3735,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,
3736,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Item was delivered when expected and was in very nice condition. Setup was a breeze, and the phone connected quickly and easily to the mobile network.Overall, I am really satisfied with this new phone."
3737,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I recieved my phone on time great service but at the beginning it's wasn't charging right! My first thought was the "" battery is bad"" them I noticed that the charger doesn't have any fast charging symbol so I used my old charger (generic but good ) and it worked and charged fast as it supposed to be.You should invest more in product that are according to the item you are selling."
3738,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Swapped up from the A20. Many improvements.  Camera works great at night as pictured in photo. Took a bit to get on my boost mobile network. Looked brand new in box. Very slipperyso get a case. Front facing fingerprint detection is not improvement. Doesn't work 75% of time. Satisfied overall.
3739,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I thought it would be a little bit used and have scratches it only has one but its mostly not important and i am satisfied with my order. I enjoy having this as an upgrade from my old phone is definitely worth it for the price.
3740,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Got the phone in great condition but my problem is the fact that the phones isn't unlocked, when stated in the description its supposed to be unlocked. i tried to put my chip in from at&t and it immediately said invalid sim, completely inaccurate from the description amazon had posted.im upset i had to do a return and they wont even send you the correct one. very disappointed with my purchase and i was in dire need of a new phone."
3741,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"This phone is NOT 5G compatible, and therefore useless with most current carriers. No where in the description does it say this. It took me hours of digging online to find this out, as there is an almost identical version of this phone that is 5G. But rest assured, this one is NOT. I was able to return it and get a refund, which I appreciate, but I had to file for the refund separately from the return, which was a time consuming hassle. Save your time and buy the Galaxy A71 that IS 5G (and almost the same price)."
3742,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Perfect condition! I opened the package, inserted the qlink Sim card into the phone and BOOM! I've never had such a quick transition. Everything works great."
3743,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I thought the a51 was supposed to have wifi calling but this one doesnt. Oh well the rest of it works.
3744,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,This phone initially worked but failed completely after 5 month of light use. Nothing happened to the phone wasnâ€™t dropped was damaged etc just went dark and never came back on. Lost data pictures msgs etc buyer beware. And seller wonâ€™t do a thing or even offer some kind of restitution.
3745,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I like the phone. Although when I first got it i couldn't use my SIM card until I went to my phone carrier. Overall it's a nice phone
3746,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"If I could give no stars I would. I received not once, but twice defective phones. The first one the microphone didnt work.calling and everything else was fully functional and worked as it should. Sent that back and within the next couple days a replacement was sent and received which I was very happy with the quick response, just to find out that the replacement wont take or receive incoming phone calls. I had cell service. I could send texts. The sim was active (AT&T) and recognized by the phone. I trouble shooted everything under the sun to no avail. Put the sim in my previous phone and it worked fine. Sending this phone back and currently waiting for my refund.Extremly disappointed with this company its like they dont even test the phones they just clean them and send them out. To each their own if you want to try them but I will never order from this company again."
3747,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,So far I like the phone just fine. When I use the key pad I actually have the letter I wanted.
3748,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Muy bien
3749,SAMSUNG,Samsung Galaxy A51,128 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,We had two Galaxy S5 and needed an upgrade but not the latest greatest.  So far this has met all our expectations and more.  I'm a programmer/analyst and normally move old data to a new phone manually but the app to move data worked GREAT.  I punched out our old S5 sim card and placed into the new phone and the switch was so easy.
3750,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,THE HAPTICS (TOUCH) ON THIS REFURB DONT WORK AT TIMES. IS THERE ANYTHING TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS?
3751,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,My battery lasts a good long time but I charge every day. I like this phone. It handles my construction job pretty well being outside in all types of weather. It's not too complicated to understand and maintain.
3752,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I upgraded from my S8+ to this S10.  I like the smaller size and the lighter weight.  This phones battery life is great, it can go all day on a single charge.  I was wondering why I was not receiving read receipts and so I went into the settings and it seems this feature was disabled by whomever had the phone previously and it cannot be restored.  Overall very satisfied and I will stick with Samsung!"
3753,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I like the phone but it wouldn't connect to the internet. I bought another phone so please just refund my money.
3754,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Lo compre para mi mamÃ¡,  todo perfecto"
3755,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"First, the battery was at 0 power upon opening the box.  The screen wasn't exactly clean, either.  I had to wipe it down to make it look ""renewed.""  Other than that, there's nothing else to review since I haven't installed the SIM and run it through its functionality.  Let's hope hope I have a winner here."
3756,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"So... I cracked the heck out of my Samsung Galaxy S21 ultra's screen beyond simple repair and needed something cheap to hold me over until the next phone is released.Honestly, if you've never experienced a high end smartphone you'll probably love this one. The battery life is great, I'm okay if I miss a days of charging my phone. Screen size is great at 6.5 inches, pretty light weight too. It's up to date as far as Android software... The camera takes acceptable shots in light and darker areas for the price range of the phone no big bells or whistles though. Expandable memory! Gotta love phones that still have an microsd slot. Headphone jack? Yep it has that too. The power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner. So far it has been 100% and zippy quick. Overall, It does what a normal midrange phone should do!On a negative side though, there's a good delay when switching between heavy apps. It's not frustratingly annoying but definitely noticeable. The sound quality isnt the best, even at maximum levels, it's just okay. Colors are not vibrant or vivid, just good... You won't get that crisp 4k imagery when watching videos or viewing high def pictures obviously. Vibrations isn't super strong, no 5g, just as bunch of minor things that can be overlooked. Space could be an issue, 32 gigs is pretty stingey, but that's what the expandable memory is for. It's a good phone for the price.Would I recommend? Yes"
3757,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Love the device but the store couldn't get it to work â˜¹ï¸â˜¹ï¸â˜¹ï¸
3758,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Will not work with prepaid services.  Has to be contract.
3759,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,This was to replace an older phone for my wife. She loves it.
3760,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Nice size and screen size.  Easy to use, since I've had a Samsung before."
3761,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I tried a metro pcs sim card with no luck, it couldn't find a network. Then I put my at&t sim in it and it found a network but when I dialed out it ended the call immediately.  Then I put my cousins t mobile sim in it and it worked perfect. It's to bad I needed it for his sister's metro pcs service and it just wouldn't work.Update: I guess it works but needed to be paired with metro by calling customer service and providing imei to pair with network"
3762,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Needed a phone to use on verizon and I would definitely recommend this phone!! This was a great purchase for our very picky teenage son. Camera and battery life is most important to him but setting it up and getting his stuff transferred EASILY was important to me. He is very happy with it, says the camera is amazing and it was so easy to pop his old sim card in this new phone and set it up for him. Face recognition is spotty but he doesn't really care because the other features make up for it!"
3763,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"The phone came unlocked just like what the seller says, it's not fake or a scam, the phone works like a charm and does what it's suppose to do as a phone"
3764,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Arrived in very good condition. Phone was very neat and I'm very satisfied. I plan to order more in future from this seller
3765,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"This was a replacement phone for my teen daughter and she's had it about a week. She seems to like it alot, it was a good price and worked with MetroPCS."
3766,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I like everything about that phone it did'nt take long to receive it.
3767,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"UPDATE: I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase of a refurbished Samsung Galaxy A12. While the phone's charger quit two months after purchase, the vendor - ASAJ WIRELESS, is honoring the 90-day Amazon warranty and a replacement charger is being shipped.  I won't hesitate to purchase from this company again."
3768,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Phone quality is low and it constantly freezes
3769,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Mom seems to like it. Better than her old Samsung.
3770,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,One time

3773,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I was worried about buying a reconditioned phone, but took a chance with the Galaxy A12 and love this phone!I've had no issues, it's easy to use and works like new for $125.00! I definitely got my money's worth and more!"
3774,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Work okay without any issue
3775,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Battery life is good
3776,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I received my phone. it looks like new but when I tried to access the operating system, the phone was asking for pattern on screen to allow access. apparantly someone else had this phone before and was using a pattern to unlock the screen. So I reset the phone to factory default. when I tried to access again, it would ask me for the unlock swipe or pattern. I couldn't even setup the phone with my account. It said that my email didn't match the email that was previously on the account. apparently as soon as you connect the phone to a wifi it will check the email corresponding to that particular phone, so if you try to setup the phone with your email it will not allow you. This is trickery and deception and they should disclose this information before hand. I ended up returning the phone!!!!!.... It is a good phone the quality is like new, but if you can't use or setup the phone what good is it?...."
3777,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,The phone is only capable of 3g or LTE+. waste of money
3778,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Overall very Satisfied with phone.
3779,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Phone is slow but battery life is great
3780,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,It's a really good phone and I like it
3781,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Heavy use 2-3 days before charge is necessary.  One hour to charge.  Pretty amazing esp for such reasonable price

3783,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,This phone will not work for you if you are on cricket wireless. Messages and data are still able to be used on this phone however you will not be able to make calls as this is what happened to me. You cannot call or receive calls.
3784,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Item arrived in good condition and seems to work just fine.
3785,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,great deal for a good phone
3786,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,You can only connect to the internet with this phone it is pieced together from other A12s and missing pieces. Cannot connect to phone services. I am so upset with this. Donâ€™t waste your money!!!!!
3787,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Great phone it was a present for my daughter and she love it
3788,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,The phone is nice and large . easy to use
3789,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Comprehensive dos cell y uno llego daÃ±ado con battery y memory card y el otro cell esta funcionando super ğŸ‘Œ, I was sent back one cell and wait for my money back .. over $175 dollars"
3790,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Update: screen went out after one day of use. Started glitching out. Luckily I was able to transfer all my husbands data before it was  almost completely distorted. Just go to target and buy the a12 from there.  It's a good phone for my husband.  He goes through phones quickly and the a12 has been his favorite.  This phone from Amazon is not 4g!! It's slow and more expensive than one that isn't renewed.  They we out at target so I paid the extra for this one but I'm gonna send it back. Not worth the waiting 10 seconds for the keyboard to show up after clicking anything. Don't buy this renewed. Just get it new.  It's only $99 dollars at Target or Walmart
3791,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Nice phone. No complaints!
3792,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"The phone is fake, the battery does not even take an hour then dies. Loses network all the time, poor camera and speaker. Worse buy ever on Amazon."
3793,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,This is made with tracfone parts not Samsung and doesn't have a serial number so you can't transfer your service over
3794,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"So the phone was dead, completely. Wouldn't even turn on. After charging it a bit and turning it on, I found that it was locked with a pattern lock. Couldn't get into the phone at all. It was just the phone, no charger. It wasn't even in the little plastic protection bag (that was sepatate in the bottom of the phone box. There was no point even considering to set it up since it was locked with a pattern lock."
3795,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Incredibly slow with very limited capabilities; no option for motion photos or screen recording
3796,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I had this phone for a few months I wanted to give it a chance before I left a review. That phone is very slow in response,it freezes continuously, Some things won't even load. It'll say connect to internet when I have full bars or even be contacted toy WiFi. I have restarted the phone to see if that was issue it wasn't. It was saying I didn't have space my phone almost immediately. I had a sim for extra storage space on it. But,I had no games not many pictures or videos and no extra apps except for what came on the phone. All in all I don't recommend this phone not even as a play phone for kids not worth it."
3797,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Amazing battery life, familiar Samsung interface, clear phone calls, great price. Phone came without any scratches or scuffsğŸ‘Œ"
3798,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Does not send or receive calls
3799,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A12,32 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Never even was able to use the phone to call out or send and receive text  messages.  Some foreign fake Samsung.
3800,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"I have T-Mobile service and when they implemented their new 5G network in mid-July my 2016 Samsung Galaxy J1 was no longer supported.  I tried this Blue phone I bought last year as a backup and it has been working fine on the new T-Mobile network for 3 weeks.  However, I have not tried T-Mobile 'data'; if I need a network connection, I just use my network at home.I have had several people tell me it is hard for them to tell hear me during phone calls.  They have been able to hear me okay using other phones calling from the same locations so the difference must be this Blue phone.I like a small phone and they are becoming hard to find.  Small is not popular so I think small phones don't receive a lot of care from manufacturers.  This phone has only 500 MB RAM and it shows.  Switching from phone to messages takes a few seconds.  The phone likes to run only one application at a time.  The OS is Android Go but the only difference I have found is that many/most desktop widgets aren't supported.  Maybe there are other differences but I don't do much with the phone other than make calls, take text notes, and keep a calendar.This phone is fine for these simple things, small in size, and works with new T-Mobile network."
3801,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"I was looking for a headhone jack, no longer a fan of wireless earbuds. Really just using it as a podcast and music player at this price it is equal to an mp3 player but with a lot more features."
3802,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,I purchased the phone to use it as a  music player with my Bose bluetooth speaker.  I understood that it might be really slow but that was okay.  And I understood that it might not work all that well as a phone bur that was okay too.  The problem is when I hooked it up to my Bose bluetooth speaker the volume control did not have enough granularity.  Music coming from Tune-In or Pandora was either too quiet or too loud with nothing in between and no way (that I could spot) to adjust this.  I can't say anything about how this device would actually work as a phone since it was never my intention to use it and I had not installed a SIM.  Note that until now I was able to use older and unused S7s to play music but they all eventually broke and I assumed it would be cheaper to buy a new (old/refurbished) phone then to fix the S7.
3803,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"I like that it comes with a little clear case, nice addition. Had to cut one of my SIM cards to fit it into the phone. Works okay for the most part. I don't like that I can't get a sensible ringtone. I don't use it as a Smart phone, it's just used for making and receiving calls and text, no fancy moves.Had an issue but took too long to share the review and I've forgotten what it is.  LOL. If it's important enough I guess I'll remember."
3804,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,It's very small and reminds you of one of the first tracphones that came out but once you turn it on it actually has decent graphics when it starts up and it seems pretty easy to use and I like how the settings are setup and things like that..but only problem I had is I signed up for qlink it's a free phone service and it won't work with any of my phones I had so I ordered this and still can't get it working so not sure if I will keep the phone or give it away yet but it is a decent phone for the price for me I wouldn't have used it for browsing and stuff though bc I have a better phone for that (my sister gave me a spectrum phone) but was just going to use for qlink.hopefully I can figure it out soon!
3805,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"I bought this to get me buy in a tight money pinch.  It's fine for texting and talking, slow but I expected that.  For a $40 phone what does one expect?"
3806,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,It's a great starter phone for my 10 yr old grandson. For the price it is great. I'm very happy with it and so is my grandson.
3807,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"I want to preface this by saying, do not buy this if you want a serious intro to android phones. Otherwise, if you're looking for a cheap lil' thing to get the job done, then go for it. It is perfectly adequate."
3808,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,I use it for receiving messages and occasional calls only. The t mobile signal is very good on it.  Itâ€™s been 6 days since my first charging. It still has 62% battery. Very impressive.  I like ultra saving mode
3809,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"The phone works, and you get what you pay for. It's extremely cheap for a smart phone and i still appreciate that it exists. I can just about browse reddit, make calls and write texts. it's still a pain and nothing about it is pleasurable though. don't bother with youtube, web browsing or games"
3810,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"Make sure you don't use ATT if you are buying this phone.Its unlocked, sure. . . but ATT specifically wont allow their service on this phone."
3811,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,This phone isnâ€™t very expensive but I didnâ€™t like how slow it operated. I returned it and purchased a refurbished iPhone instead.
3812,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,When I call the company BLU they were very helpful. But MetroPCS don't work with BLU so we couldn't connect it. But the seller send you a label to send it back for free and you have to do is print and send back.mine is on the way back as of 10/13/22 thank you once again.Wish it would have work with MetroPCS price was great
3813,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"Very nice; it is small in size.  I brought it for my grandma.  She is not up to date with all those smart phone! With old people very hard to find a smart phone that is light in weight and can do most of everything! At least now I can video call to her; I teach her little by little to use the phone, video calls, watch YouTube; and browse online! Very practical and affordable for the price! I loves everything about it.  And, very easy for someone with no knowledge about internet would be able to use! I called it is for Senior phone! But, actually itâ€™s can do a lot of things as I was mentioned on the above.  Very good for the price, the size, and light weight!  Not too many senior people willing to carry around the phone with heavy weight phone and bulky in size.  All in all, loves the size and the light weight; and the price! Works amazingğŸ˜˜ğŸ‘ğŸ»"
3814,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"I am editing this review because I reported the problem through Customer chat and they are sending UPS to pick up the phone and they are refunding me my money, that is great service, thank you Amazon !"" The sim card worked ok but there's a problem with the sound, no one can hear me but very faintly; I checked on Google and yes, a lot of other people have the same problem with this phone; it is also very cheaply made, I should have spent more and got a better phone."""
3815,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,Great starter phone for a kid that needs a phone or as a punishment for one that broke their phone. Doesn't have 4G so will be unable to connect to cell service in the states as all carriers are 4G or 5G so it has limited future use.
3816,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"What you need to make sure of is:SIM cards come in Nano SIM, Micro SIM and Standard SIM. My SIM was a NANO - thus it would not fit in the Mini SIM card slot. - thus No SERVICENano - 8.8 mm x 12.3 mmMicro - 12 mm x 15 mmStandard - 15 mm x 25 mm1 inch is equal to 25.4 millimeters,This is a GSM Phone and probably uses a Micro SIM card."
3817,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"This is a sub $100 smartphone that does what it says on the tin. It turns on, connects to 4G LTE and runs Android Go. Is it responsive? No, but it is usable with patience. Itâ€™s a decently built phone with expandable memory, for the price you canâ€™t do a lot better."
3818,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"I know this is an inexpensive phone, but there's no excuse for being this slow. And I don't mean for streaming or anything intensive, either. It's just s-l-o-w. Click and wait. Wait. Wait. Even on the most basic features you wait and wait and wait.I often miss calls because the button to accept the call sometimes takes 8+ rings to show up. So frustrating.This might be the fault of my network provider, but it drops calls all the time (""network busy"" or ""network unavailable"").I still can't figure out how to hang up on voicemail. There's no button. Sometimes it just keeps yacking and yacking until I reboot. Every time I access voicemail, it says it's not set up, but the option to set it up doesn't do anything.Holding it against your face like a normal phone results in all sorts of weird button presses. Sound quality is poor. It works better on speaker held farther away. Ridiculous. Did the developers even try to use this thing?Overall a lousy phone. I'm keeping it because it's simple and marginally useful, but pay a little extra for something that actually works. That said, it's hard to find 4"" phones these days, which is my optimal size.---Update: I downgraded this to one star. This piece of junk doesn't qualify as a phone. I miss a lot of calls because the option to accept them doesn't even appear until 8+ rings in. When it does show up in time, it doesn't work half the time. I press accept over and over while it's ringing, and the button blinks showing I pressed it, but no accept. Pure garbage. Spend a few dollars more and get a real phone."
3819,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,It was super tiny & my sim card didn't work inside the phone whatsoever but my fault for not really reading description
3820,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,The phone is a nice smaller size for front pocket. I can't comment on anything Elsa because my carrier couldn't couldn't use it even though it was advertised unlocked for all carriers.
3821,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,the battery in this only stays charged  a few hours even when not being used
3822,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"brought this as a throw away phone until the new iphone comes out and its really slow, the apps and internet are non-functional even on wifi.  It is only good for phone calls and text, the call quality isn't good since the person on the other line can not hear clearly, it is just good as a cheap temp phone nothing more."
3823,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,This phone is exactly what I expected for the price. It is super slow and the battery life is bad. But it makes phone calls and you can run a few apps on it. If you're looking to use this as a sophisticated smartphone to use for school or business then this is definitely NOT the phone for you. This is only good for casual use or a spare phone.
3824,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"Very unresponsive touchscreen, the processor on it made my 1995 Dell Desktop look like a supercomputer.  The screen resolution and camera are straight out of 2003 technology. I don't even know why they bothered putting a front facing camera on the thing.This is a burner phone. Pure and simple. Make calls and text sketchy people on it. That's all you're gonna want to use it for."
3825,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,Just make calls and use on WhatsApp... Battery is NOT good.
3826,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"I like the size it can fit in my pocket, but the screen is dull so is the camera."
3827,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,Its very slow
3828,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,The best so far
3829,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,Screen small. Bought for an international gift.
3830,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"It's nice it's just when you actually want to play games on ot os when the problem occurs. it lags so bad and even when you watch YouTube. It's perfect for phone calls and maybe texting but other than that, not a very productive phone."
3831,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"I havenâ€™t tried it yet and reason I bought it, is to use on my trip to Brazil, because other expensive cells there, can be stolen and this one, nobody care about it."
3832,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,Canâ€™t be used on just wifi
3833,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,I like it had to send back I could not get reception on it where I live it was a nice phone for the price
3834,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,it fit well in the pocket. I liked it . However it needed memory card I no longer have access to.
3835,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"Worked well as a temporary phone but it pooped out after about 20 days...just in time to return it! I have an iPhone, but this was fun top play with some exclusive Android apps before I returned it Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯"
3836,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"The reason I bought it was because I was looking for a cheap burner/backup phone. When I first got it I really wasn't expecting anything due to the super low price. Even for a 399 dollars phone I would not expect it to be usable or enjoyable to use let alone this 39.99USD phone.This phone does exactly what it needs to. It makes calls, has 2 sim slots and is small and light enough to be carried as a secondary phone. To my surprise it comes with a protective case and also screen protector installed, that is one crazy deal for a phone!I would absolutely recommend getting this!"
3837,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,CÃ³modo no pesado
3838,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,Itâ€™s work good if you want use it for calling only not pictures
3839,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,Good price.
3840,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,Great quality for a low price.
3841,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"I only use this phone to listen to music and play very small mobile games. It runs my music great and it doesn't randomly close apps. Is it slow? Yes. But that's what you get with a $40 phone.UPDATE: Ive had it for about a month and a half and the phone decided it didnt want to allow me to get into it anymore, it does not track my finger. There was no damage to it at all and that swhy i dropped my rating from 3 to 2 stars"
3842,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,The physical dimensions is just perfect for putting into the pocket. The phone is quick good for entry-level users with a low price.
3843,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,I love it because I wish that phone is big
3844,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,"This phone does absolutely nothing other than receive a text or call. I could never install a simple app like uber or WhatsApp on it. The lag is traumatizing and although I understand it is just 30 bucks, it simply does nothing at all, even the call and texting have a super lag. Invest few more bucks and get a working phone."
3845,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,Phone was smaller than expected. Have trouble hanging up calls
3846,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,The phone works fine for calls and text messaging but the processor is dreadfully slow when accessing the internet.  I still do love the compact size that fit nicely in the hand or a shirt pocket unlike the tablet sized smart phones on the market now.  If you want a small phone for making calls or sending texts but rarely need to look something up on the internet this phone will probably work for you.
3847,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,Tried to get this phone after my Samsung broke and I was waiting for it to get repaired.  All I wanted was phone and text.  T-Mobile said they don't have any networks below 4G so this is useless.  On the plus side it can be used as a cheap trade in for a much better deal on their promotions.
3848,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,I gave it to my gardener and now I can communicate with him :)
3849,BLU,Advance L5,16 GB,Android 8.1,4 Inches,I purchased the phone which shipped in a few hours.  It arrived without the battery and I am due to leave the country tomorrow.  Now I am screwed.
3850,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A13 5G,64 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I am very satisfied with this phone considering the fact it is a Renewed phone. I had to replace a Galaxy S7 and had to on a budget. I was concerned buying Renewed would be a gamble and I will update this if I have problems later on. On day one, however, this phone is fast and all the quirks like face recognition and fingerprints work when tested.It had no cosmetic damage or any signs of use at a glance. I ran an app to test its specifications, no problems there. I ordered this on a Tuesday and it arrived on Friday.The Battery holds up, I'm not sure what the standard is, but it seems efficient even during heavy use.If you want a phone for less than retail that will outperform most cheaper phones I would definitely go for this."
3851,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A13 5G,64 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I like the long battery life so far.  It's heavier than my previous Moto (but that was super-thin). My biggest complaint (and it sounds silly), but when i text, it rarely corrects my mis-types into known words. IDK why, but for some reason, my i's & o's wind up being 8's & 9's in the MIDDLE of a word (& it won't correct it).  Obviously, I'm fat-fingering my keys, but it SHOULD correct it.  And, auto-correct IS ON.  I don't have that problem with my work iphone or my previous Moto, but i'm not returning to Moto due to their minimum # of system upgrades.  My wife hears my frustration & constantly tells me-Just get a new phone...."
3852,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A13 5G,64 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I purchased this phone to replace my cracked/broken A10 that would not be replaced by insurance.  I wasn't looking to spend a ton of money to replace it and found this A13 for under 200.00.  It was a decent upgrade from the A10 I had.  The camera works amazingly well, the screen resolution is crisp, clear.  If you 'live' on your phone you can find one that will better suit your needs, but for a casual phone user like myself (mostly talk, text, web surfing, etc.) this was a great little upgraded phone for me.Set up was super simple.  Pop your SIM card out of your old phone, and reinsert it into the new one.  Make sure both phones are connected to the same wifi, as the new phone will automatically ask you to transfer data from your old phone to new.  This process was fairly quick and really hands-free.  Be sure to back up your contact list to your SIM card in your old phone before doing this, as it will save you the hassle of figuring out who's who if some of the newer contacts haven't been saved to SIM.  Otherwise, the setup of this phone is really quite painless.I'd recommend this phone to anyone who is a causal user and not looking for a powerhouse phone.  It's fast, responsive, aesthetically pleasing to look at, screen is bright and crisp.  It arrived in new condition, no marks, scratches, etc.  Very happy so far."
3853,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A13 5G,64 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,I did not read the description of phone properly.  I had AT&T service before and do not want again.TOO expensive and bad customer service.  The xfer of information from old phone went great but Idid not understand that it required AT&T service I thought I could still use my Xfinity.  Case was easy to attach to phone.
3854,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A13 5G,64 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"It was easy to set up at home and easy to transfer data, pictures, etc with ease. My old phone was not the same brand but was able to transfer info to the new phone via Wi-Fi."
3855,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A13 5G,64 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,It is user-friendly and very reliable.
3856,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A13 5G,64 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Had to return. After several hours of attempts, could not get security updates for Android 11. Was nearly 1 year out of date! (and yes, Samsung is supposed to support this phone for at least another year or two)."
3857,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A13 5G,64 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Iâ€™m very happy with this purchase phone works incredibly well.
3858,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A13 5G,64 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Works great with my att service. Saved a lot of money. Like new. Great deal!
3859,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A13 5G,64 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,The accessories that came with it very bad very poorly packed something is not right about the SIM card drawer
3860,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A13 5G,64 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,It was very good and better than a lot of older models
3861,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A13 5G,64 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"This is not the first time I purchased a supposedly ""unlocked"" device from Amazon only to be unpleasantly surprised. The phone looked fine for a refurb but when I tried to use it with my Consumer Cellular phone it was clearly still locked to the AT&T network. After going through the hassle of manually setting up the APN I could not make any calls - when I went to the Network Operator option the fact it would not allow me to see other networks or do a manual network selection was a dead giveaway. Additionally there were no accessories included (like a charger  or cable) and the complete lack of useful documentation was challenging. Letting someone know in a quick start where to find the fingerprint sensor would have been nice. Overall a big fail.As an FYI - I once purchased a Comcast compatible modem so I would not have to pay Comcast's ridiculous modem rental fees only to discover that the ""new"" Modem Amazon sent me was registered to another user when comcast came to do the install."
3862,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A13 5G,64 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Got value for money.
3863,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A13 5G,64 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I bought this because it was claimed to be unlocked. WRONG. It is locked to ATT, and I am unable to activate phone service on this unit. (I have a Tmobile GSM network). Furthermore, there was just a little cord to charge the phone which is not the standard USB connection, so good luck finding an easy way to charge this. Also, there was no pin shipped to remove the sim card holder. Extremely disappointing and Amazon should know better than to put stuff like this on their site."
3864,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A13 5G,64 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Muy bueno
3865,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A13 5G,64 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I didn't find out until 5 months, we went out of town when I try to make a call from my hotel room phone comes up as not register with network, after the trip i reach out my service provider (Verizon) he said it can be use with sim but some places will not work, now I am stuck with it its unlock alright"
3866,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A13 5G,64 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"I WILL FOREVER NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN  , I JUST RETURNED IT BACK, IT DOESNT RECOGNISES MY WIFI IN MY AREA, WHAT A FAULTY PHONE IRRITATING, ITS LIKE THESE PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY SELLING FAULTY ITEMS"
3867,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A13 5G,64 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,Amazon knows this phone is unlocked and doesn't fix the advertising to make it more clear. It is obviously marketed as an unlocked phone and it is not unlocked nor is it unlockable.
3868,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A13 5G,64 GB,Android,6.5 Inches,"Disaster!!! Previous organization had all its permissions still on this phone, cant use camera or camscanner and they can monitor all your activity, DONT BUY A PHONE FROM AMAZON!!!"

3895,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"                    The media could not be loaded.
                



Â I bought the UMIDIGI A7 Pro Unlocked Cell Phone (4GB+64GB) in Cosmic Black. I was very skeptical as my previous purchase of an old UMIDIGI model turned out to be a disappointment. But the A7 Pro has been a pleasant surprise. As you can see in my unboxing video, the phone comes pretty decently boxed. You open to find a ""Thank you"" note which is nice. The phone is well-protected on both sides with protective plastic film and what felt even better was it came ready with a screen protector (along with a phone case!). Under the phone, the instruction manual is nicely enveloped, clipped with a SIM tray opener and beneath is the USB - C charger. Straight out of the box, I put the phone on charge and after it reached 100% I transferred all my data from my old phone through Google in a jiffy. Updates were pretty fast and it did not drain the battery as much as I expected. I have run the phone for a day with social media, emails, browsing at full blast and I need to charge now after approx. 36 hours. Camera takes pretty good picture. Sound quality is crisp with 4G LTE VOLTE. Although the OCTA-CORE processor claims to be robust, I have to keenly observe and perhaps get back as I am not into gaming. The convenience of having dual SIM running capacity is a plus. Overall, pretty good phone for the price. Those who are thinking about giving this a try, don't hesitate. It's worth it."
3896,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"Great phone for the price.Plenty of memory, great camera and it even takes your temperature."
3897,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"Umidigi A7 ProJust received my phone. I  am extremely pleased!The packaging is pretty good the elegant case makes the unboxing pleasant. Included with the phone are: printed instructions, charger brick, usb type C cable, pre installed case and pre installed screen protector(nice touch umidigi)Letâ€™s talk about the pros:The screen is gorgeous! really sharp and brilliant. Works really well in all conditions including bright days.Performance is really good I was able to run any application with no lag.No issues with android auto.Call quality is really good, I have at&t, no drop calls and LTE works rally good, getting 100mbps in my area.Battery life is good. This thing has a massive battery. Getting about 2 days with normal use and about a day with heavy use(playing games, video and music with external speaker.Camera is great under most normal conditions(see below) micro lens works great, wide angle lens also really good. Sharp clear images.Price. For a budget level phone you are getting so much.Cons:Camera can use some refinement in very low light. This is normal on any camera phone.Wish there was Bluetooth 5 as I have aptx headphones.Overall the phone is fantastic and does anything a phone that cost x10 more can do. I highly recommend it!!"
3898,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"This is my second phone I've purchased from Umidigi - my F1 Play kept soldiering on after I shattered the screen by dropping it on cement about 15 times through food deliveries.I'm pleased to say that unit was still going (albeit handicapped) when I finally decided to spring for the A7 Pro.For the money you'll be hard pressed to find something comparable - I'm pleased with the power, screen brightness, and all the extras that came with the phone (attached extra screen protector and a slim form fitting case).The fingerprint reader is fast and  snappy (actually improved upon from my F1) and I really canâ€™t complain for the price.Letâ€™s get one thing straight, this phone is not a flagship killer but itâ€™s damn good for the money.I work 12 hour shifts and depend on my phone for every single delivery. Through rain and snow, drops, falls, and slams in my car door it keeps soldiering on like a reliable friend.If you need something durable, with a bright screen, great battery, and a price that wonâ€™t destroy you if it breaks, get this phone.Itâ€™s the working manâ€™s phone."

Aside from screen distortion it would randomly open apps, restart itself, or generally act possessed by an evil entity. This is absolutely a ""you get what you pay for"" phone. (Actually, the $50 prepaid Verizon phone I got at a big box store over six years ago is still going strong, so in this case you get *less* than what you pay for.)"

3902,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"We bought this for my wife (an iPhone user) as a quick work phone. I needed to have stock Android and something that was unlocked so if we needed we could test a couple of different carriers with. WiFi calling was also a must. For the price I was blown away! Build quality, features, stock Android and it will be version upgradable. My only complaint (and itâ€™s not something she would ever use it for anyways) is no NFC for Google/Android Pay, but seriously, this is a flagship killer if you are on a budget.No bloatware. It charges fast, works well, call quality, video chat (tested with Google Duo) quality, and battery life were all excellent. Awesome phone, especially if you already are an Android user."
3903,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,My first impression was great because the phone looks and feels great. I appreciate the included case and screen protector. I most enjoy how nice the screen is. The display is bright and clear. I have been using this phone for mostly youtube watching and am very satisfied. I got the 64GB version because I plan on using a micro sd card to store photos on. I was not able to find the app draw in the settings but that is okay. Overall I like this phone because of the combination of good quality and low price.

I tried to work it out with supprt, they wanted me to make videos after the 8th exchange, I gave up and returned the product, thanks Amazon!"

3910,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"This phone has incredible power for its price point.  The octa-core processor is more than sufficient for decent gaming; it's ran anything i've thrown at it without a hitch.  The camera is fantastic, which is the main reason why I purchased.  Excellent contrast, focus, and resolution.  All-around excellent buy that's worth the money spent!"

After nine months (still in warranty) the case is starting to split and edge of the swollen battery is visible. My UmiDigi A3 Pro bought end of 2018 is now completely split in two pieces by battery, but I thought the problem was my fault (got too hot, or overcharged) so I got the A7. Now I know the problems are not my fault. UmiDigi Customer Service at first said by email 'sorry for the inconvenience, do not worry' and asked for photos. I sent the photos, but now Customer Service stop responding. In the photo, totally split A3 Pro is at left and starting to split A7 Pro is at right. Beware!"

Â I got this Umidigi phone for a few reasons, one: it was a good price. Two: its not a big name brand, but is prominent enough that there is a fair amount of support out there. Three: it is factory unlocked and supports dual SIM and expandable memory! I was also pleasantly surprised when the phone arrived and I felt how premium it actually is. The frame is an aluminum alloy, the front and the back are glass, not name brand Gorilla, but still a nice and durable glass. It had a screen protector on from the factory that was decently nice, but at certain angles you could see ""waves"" and you can notice them in the video I included with this review. the fingerprint reader is in a nice position on the back like a Google Pixel, and works decently well. It's not as fast or accurate as the Galaxy S9 Plus I also have, but it works well enough that most users probably won't even notice its shortcomings. The screen is actually quite impressive for a phone at this price and actually looks equivalent or even better in some situations, compared to some of the current iPhones a lot of people use. The camera, well it's there, and it's not as bad as I expected it to be, but it's definitely far from impressive. I'd say it's about equivalent to a Galaxy S8. The flash on this phone though, WOW. The flash is actually slightly brighter than the flash on my S20 Ultra! It's not brightness adjustable like most flagship phones, but damn did it impress me anyways. The processor the phone uses is certainly not top tier and I think probably actually a bit slower than they claim; that being said, it is still very usable for texting, calling, streaming, and other basic smartphone tasks. I didn't try gaming on it because I am fairly confident it would struggle or just be too slow entirely. For the casual user though, I would say the processor is more than good enough. (I also just installed a new update this morning and so far the phone seems to actually be more responsive and overall faster). The software that you get with this phone is actually really nice because it's BARE BONES Android 10! The only thing I'm not a huge fan of in that regard, is the fact that Android thinks the phone is a Google Pixel... This isn't a problem, but it can be a frustration at times because it offers you toggles or recommended settings for things the phone doesn't even actually have. If Umidigi were to go in and re-write some of the software, just enough that it doesn't keep trying to push me to set up face-unlock (does not support face-unlock) or trying to get me to ""finish setup and customize your Pixel"", then the software would be perfect. This however is a small annoyance and in my opinion shouldn't steer you away from the phone. Overall I am actually really impressed with this phone, especially for the price. I read some sort of negative reviews of Umidigi phones prior to buying this, that pretty much complained the phones were nice quality, but the support and continuous security updates (or lack thereof) were basically a joke. I have found this to not be true so far however, with the phone having done a major update right out of the box, and then a security patch later in that first week, then another about one week ago, and then a fairly major software update this morning. If you compare that to my Galaxy S20 Ultra, that's nearly double the frequency of updates. If I had to guess, it probably won't get that kind of continued support for much further into the future, but either way, it still is plenty good for the price of the phone. Overall if you are looking for a nice Android phone to do some tweaking and messing around with, or looking for a backup device, or maybe just want a nice simple and cheap but usable phone that doesn't cost $1,500, then I would actually recommend this phone. It is one of the nicest in build quality I have ever seen for the price, the software is just good'ole Android 10, the screen is better than most iPhones, and the price is perfect."
3926,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,I am updating this review to say I am disappointed in it.  The phone was ordered in Aug 2020 and now it's Nov 2020 and the phone no longer turns on.  It turned on earlier in the day and now it's just dead. So sad.
3927,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"This phone is a tremendous value.  It has so many bells and whistles and they work too.  The finger print reader works very well and the phone is FAST.  It has the latest Android 10 system.  I very much suggest this phone for a new user or even an intermediate user because of the specs.  Great price, great service from the folks at Umidigi makes this a win win!"
3928,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"El telÃ©fono funciona muy bien, trabaja bien con las telefÃ³nicas en LatinoamÃ©rica.Si vienes de utilizar un telÃ©fono con una pantalla mÃ¡s pequeÃ±a, menos capacidad en todo, notas en seguida la diferencia, me parece muy buen producto ademÃ¡s de que se agradece el traer funda y protector instalado"

3935,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,Phone is pretty snappy for entry level.  It has pure android and expandable memory which is a plus.  Glitches a little under gaming loads  like Call of duty.

Â Honest Review: for that price, the performances are outstanding. The processor is fast, it handles 84 apps with zero problems, no delay in processing, thanks also to the 8GB RAM. The cameras are good; I love the selfie camera. The color is beautiful the material feels good. Having a thermometer is a crazy reality.It works with no problems with a T Mobile virtual provider."

3938,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"Sleek-looking phone.  Pictures taken with the phone came out clean and sharp.  Playing shooter or intensive games was problematic since there was occasional frame loss and freezes during gameplay.  The battery life was typical although once it got down to 50%, it seemed to deplete at a much faster rate than the first half with idle usage throughout.  Transfering the sim card was simple and it's nice to have a second sim slot and a MicroSD storage expansion as well.  Phone calls were clear on both ends.  The general usage of the phone was crisp and responsive.  If you're looking for a nice phone on a budget and want to be able to take good quality pictures and utilize non-intensive apps without issue, this device will serve your needs.  If the intention is to play top-end or intensive mobile games, consider looking elsewhere."
3939,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"Hi I have been an Apple user for years and I got this phone to try the android world and here is what I found out-Phone build very good and it comes with case and screen protector-phone display the most, clear of any notch or black bars, it is complete display, great for videos and gaming, the colors are vivid-The design of the phone gives a nice feel to hold with semi curvy at the back and flat front- Face recognition works like charm and tried the fingerprint works very well- Camera I toke few pic it seems very decent I have to try it more and I will update my review with the results,-Phone comes with USB C charger , it does not have wireless charging featureOverall I love the phone and its very good for the price ,  I will keep playing with it and keep you updated ."
3940,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"This is not my first Umidigi phone, I bought the One Pro over a year ago and have been super happy with it but wanted to upgrade to a larger screen. That being said, I was expecting the same quality and performance as my One Pro (since I paid about the same price for it), but this A7 Pro exceeded my expectation in many ways. A few things that really surprised me with this A7 Pro are:1) Much better quality build (front and back glass)2) The screen is more vibrant and the colors really pop3) For the price, the camera is very impressive and definitely better than the One Pro4) Battery life is much more impressive (but of course the battery deteriorates overtime)That said, you still get all the other cool features such as fingerprint scanner, fast charge, dual sim, and Android 10 right out of the box. At this price point you really can't go wrong with the A7 pro!"

3942,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"I've been struggling with this phone for a week and am about to give up. 1) First off I can't seem to connect to 4G service with rogers (only 3G shows up) despite verifying APN settings. 2) For some reason the only widgets that will load on the homescreen at startup are google account related widgets (like google calendar). All third party widgets seem to be blocked from booting up (just a blank space with error message) until you manually open each app individually, and then maybe the widget will load if you're lucky. It's not a time thing either as I've waited several hours to see if the widgets would load on their own. In my case STOCard and ToDoList widgets won't load and even a simple clock widget cannot be loaded on startup.Save your frustration, buy something else, I've wasted a week and will be sending back.Update: Been a week and no response from their customer service online help system... No support for product = what should be a zero rating."

Once in a blue moon it will have a slight lag (for a split second) but this passes. I've also experienced a random restart before upon waking up the phone (don't know if it was from an update?). If you don't do serious phone gaming, but like me, watch Youtube, surf internet, stream music, text, call, take/ send photos, email....this phone does all these things extremely well.

3953,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"This is my first purchase of a Renewed cell phone.  I was pleasantly surprised that it has no signs of wear, had been wiped clean of any previous owners use/apps etc. The phone ports were also very clean with no dust of dirt.  The battery charges to at least 95% (probably more but, haven't let it charge further than that).  It lasts for a day and a half with my usage which is mostly texts, email and phone calls. The fingerprint and face recognition are about 70% but you can use a pin to unlock as well.It was fully unlocked and easy to transfer everything from my old phone to this S10e.  I did have to use a double ended usb c to transfer my data.  I simply removed my sim card from the old phone (Samsung with AT&T as my provider) and placed it in the slot.  I connected the wires and followed the instruction for that type of transfer.If the phone lasts for more than a year I will have gotten my money's worth from this purchase.  I will definitely search for renewed phones in the future.  It saves the environment and waste of materials. Thank you, Amazon for offering this service."

If you have an USB type C to HDMI adapter or cable, itâ€™s easy to connect to any tv or monitor. Itâ€™s plug-in play. You can choose to mirror your screen or use Samsung dex. You can also disable the Bixby Button or program it to do something else like opening your camera. The camera takes great photos. The phone also came with a fast charger as well.At the time of this review, you can upgrade this phone to Android 12.Unlike the other Samsung devices this screen is flat. So itâ€™s easier/cheaper to get a screen protector and case.For people who love retro gaming, you can run emulators for Super Nintendo, Gameboy or PlayStation. You can even play GameCube/Wii games.Overall great phone and great price!"

3970,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,I'm trying to update the phone to the latest Android system but it keeps restarting and not updating even though it appears to be installing the update.
3971,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Fair price.  Received as promised
3972,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Phone came bubble-wrapped, while charger and cord were loose in the box. Phone in mint condition, very clean, no smudges until I touched it. Did have to update the Android software to version 12. Since I don't have a data plan, I used my Wi-fi to do the update. Other than that, the phone works just fine. I'm using Consumer Cellular with a T-Mobile sim card. The phone is slippery, yes, so I've ordered a protective skin so I don't drop it."
3973,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Looked brand new. Battery stays charged when not in use. Came with a c type charger. Speed is good had no problems loading apps or streaming.
3974,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,phone looks new and appears to be a great deal. haven't activated it yet.
3975,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Worked great at firstThe seller was very helpful in the return process
3976,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"I am vey happy with my S10. This is my 4th Samsung Galaxy. The phone looks new, hooked right up, and loaded up immediately.  It looks nice, feels  ice, and performs superbly. It is connected by Bluetooth to my hearing aids, so I can listen to streaming or on-board music. It is fast, responsive, and lightweight.  It even arrived earlier than it was supposed to. It's a great phone and has so much memory, I will never get any warnings of it becoming unresponsive."
3977,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"The S10e was by my eye in perfect condition.  It looks new - never used.  A leap of faith buying a reconditioned phone but with Amazon's 90 day return policy I gave it a shot. So far, excellent.  I will update close to the 90 day date."
3978,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,My LG phone died and I needed another one. So far I have been very happy with my SE10e so far. Wish it came with a gallery for photos.
3979,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Cellphone was Refurbished but it looks brand new, no scratches, and is fully unlocked. The Charger that came with the phone was not the original Samsung Charger, but it charged my phone super fast, no complaints. Was able to use Straight Talk Verizon Sim Card. Size of phone is small but fits in my small crossbody shoulder bag which is exactly what I wanted, I don't like big cellphones. Extremely happy with my purchase. (Samsung Galaxy S10e)"
3980,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Great battery life, just like new.Shipping was extremely. Great value for the money. Would highly recommend buying this phone."
3981,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,I never really write reviews but after reading the negative reviews and the fact the phone was renewed my expectations weren't high . Phone exceeded expectations it looks and functions like a new phone not a single scratch or imperfection . Will buy from again
3982,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Just bought this product - its scratch less, mint condition with seller claiming to be unlocked which is Partially correct because it appears the product was prior used with Sprint network therefore OMADM App keeps popping up with showing ACTIVATE YOUR DEVICE after every hour thus eating battery and bandwidth. I have tried every way to stop this app executing but have been unsuccessful. Seller should already be aware of this issue if selling similar products and also needs to clearly describe this situation to buyers and now I intend to return this product."
3983,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Great Price, Works with Puretalk Mobile, Easy Phone Transfer. Can't find a scratch anywhere. Brand New in Appearance and Operation. Fast Shipping."
3984,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,I like the phone except it gets very hot while using.  You cannot have more than 1 app open at a time.
3985,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Good buy, good battery life."
3986,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Difficult recommend
3987,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"The phone was not in renewed condition, had a screen protector attached and other signs of wear.  On top of that, it was either not a US version of not properly unlocked, as it would not connect to T Mobile or Metro SIM cards.  This is not how the item was described.  Finally, when I shipped the item back (by the date requested from Amazon per policy), they have denied the return.  Awful seller experience"
3988,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Item damaged and defective, black screen of death took over immediately. not able to see anything just all  blank black screen. cracked back cover as well. travel damages."
3989,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Phone arrived with broken screen
3990,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,This phone kept saying it was going to lock me out which made it very difficult to do many things on it. It also had a crack across screen which was hard to see at first. I had to return phone and seller shorted me $23.90 because I forgot to return charger. You can get a charger for much less than that. Seller also said I was late in returning it which I was not. I'm looking at the receipt from UPS right now.
3991,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,The battery did not last three hours. The phone was hot to hold after five minutes.
3992,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"I was under the impression that an unlocked phone worked on any mobile carrier network. I was wrong. Phone didn't connect with my existing Sim card. I called At&t and was on the phone with customer service for an hour and was told that I needed a new Sim card. I went to the At&t store and was provided with a new Sim card. This didn't work either. So after wasting a week waiting for the phone and hours to set it up, ultimately I had to return it. Then I had to wait another week for another phone that did work right out of the box.I also haven't been issued a refund for the item even though it was returned to them (I checked the return and it made it) almost a week ago."
3993,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Love this phone.
3994,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,I dnt get any phone ok I jus get the cable
3995,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Phone was very dusty from speaker, charging ports and air phone plugs . Unpleased based on the product description before purchased. Will never order from same seller."
3996,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,Plugged in the device it started overheating immediately.  Graphics were bad.  Strongly recommend not purchasing this device from this seller.
3997,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Great price with Samsung Quality and Amazon's great return policy, however equals Samsung S8... Not worth it, returned"
3998,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,this phone is not fully unlocked and can only be used with verizon . its a waste of money.
3999,SAMSUNG,S10E,128 GB,Android,5.8 Inches,"Device was advertised ""fully unlocked,"" yet, with working SIM, will not connect to other networks. No product support available."
4000,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"Love it,only thing is the color on the metal has a little fade color on it and screen has a little small line but i wiped it down well and came out alright but iphone came out nice and clean"

Â I ordered this iPhone 13 in excellent condition. When the phone got here checked the battery's health it was at 100%. Practically new pretty much no scratches in the picture you can probably see my fingerprints. the phone was really clean so it was hard not to leave fingerprints.coming from a Samsung Galaxy S20 I can see why people like iPhones. the phone is very simple to use and a lot of apps just work smoother than android. the transfer was really easy just had to download ""Move to iOS"" on the google play store and it moved all of my data to this iPhone 13I will keep you guys updated on the phone. pretty much a new iPhone and for the price point  I can't complain about what I got.also in last picture I wanted to show everything I got in the box the charging cord is brand new I liked that a lot."
4002,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,The phone came in 4 days late but it was worth every penny.Its a great phone battery capacity is 100% like new excellentcondition no scratches cameras are accurate everything is great even thoughi was hesitant about buying it from amazon but its worth it.!!!
4003,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,I give this seller top ratings.  Of course iphones are the best but the phones from this seller are brand new even though sold as refurbished and it arrived in good time and good condition.
4004,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"used the phone for a week now and everythingâ€™s fine so far! other than some barely visible scratches on the screen, the phone conditionâ€™s pretty good. luckily i got one that had 100% battery capacity so that was nice"
4005,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,It was for a nice cheaper price and despite being refurbished it looks and feels like itâ€™s a brand new phone straight from Apple. Arrived days sooner than expected as well.I would recommend it lol
4006,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"Iâ€™m happy with the purchase, but I took 1 star away because there are a number of micro scratches (and 1 deeper â€œdotâ€ scratch) on the phone I received for being in the â€œexcellentâ€ category. Theyâ€™re forgivable marks, but I wouldnâ€™t call it excellent.Battery is at 100% capacity and Iâ€™m having no technical issues."
4007,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,My husband surprised me with an upgrade fom 11 to a 13 and Iâ€™m still finding out all the things itâ€™s capable of doing. I highly recommend this phone.
4008,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,My daughter lost her iPhone 13 so I bought this unlocked iPhone 13 as a replacement. Phone was in excellent condition and looked new. Works like new. She's very happy with it.
4009,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"The phone didnâ€™t come with the SIM card removal tool, but itâ€™s nothing a paperclip couldnâ€™t fix."

4011,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"Un equipo totalmente versÃ¡til,  de acuerdo a la descripciÃ³n  del vendedor, funciona totalmente de maravilla"
4012,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"Frankly, I don't care enough to return the phone and I already put a screen protector on, but yeah there is some minor cosmetic damage such as; scratches on the back and the front, as well as some minor damage on the bottom right corner of the edge where it was probably dropped in the past. It doesn't affect the way the phone functions but is really more of a heads-up to whoever is thinking about purchasing from this seller"
4013,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"Came with a charger, and a back that plugs into the wall. Came with 100% battery life and doesnâ€™t skip at all, works like a brand new iPhone. I love how it has 128 GB because my old phone only had 64. No scratches, no cracks, and was very well protected in the box. It was easy to transfer my old phone data on to here. I also love the color, (I got pink)"

4018,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,Pricey but what a performer. Camera is great. WiFi is stronger than my old iPhone 6s. Love the bigger screen. Battery is forever.
4019,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"I was surprised, I honestly didnâ€™t expect it to look this new, and the battery life is at 100%. This is definitely worth it!!"
4020,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"You really wouldâ€™ve thought I received a brand new phone ! The only thing that was different was the off brand charger that came with it. Other than that, no scratches , no mechanical issues, and battery life is at 100%!"

4023,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,Lots to learn with a new phone but I love it
4024,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"one of the most expensive and best products iâ€™ve bought on amazon! this phone is basically brand new! the battery capacity is 100% and i have yet to discover any problems with this phone! worth the price, 10/10"
4025,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,This is my First experience with an iPhone I had a 13 mini and I just couldnâ€™t handle the smallness of it so I sent it back and got the 13 and I really like the size of it it fits my hand good.. really in love with this phone! Technology can s amazing!
4026,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"Too many noticeable scratches and paint chips to consider the phone in â€œexcellent conditionâ€. Upon trying to charge the phone, it had difficulties detecting the charger. Not sure if this was due to the phone or the other person on the line, but when calling someone they couldnâ€™t hear me clearly either. Did not come in the original iPhone box and did not come with any original iPhone power adapter or cables. For the amount paid and the condition stated, I expected better. Not terrible, just not great."

4030,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,Bought it because I cracked my Samsung s21 Iâ€™ve used apple products before but this exceeded my expectations. The back is slippery so might want to slap a case on it and battery life (depending on usage) can easily last me a full day might need to turn on power saved mode and decrease screen brightness near the end of the day but you wonâ€™t need to worry about it dying on you real quickly
4031,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"Excelente tengo una semana de haberlo recibido y me llegÃ³ en buenas condiciones un par de rayones milimÃ©tricos pero muy muy difÃ­cil de detectar a simple vista.Lo Ãºnico que criticarÃ­a son los controles de calidad, debido  que en la galerÃ­a venÃ­an fotos del dueÃ±o anterior,  las borrÃ© y ya!"
4032,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"I like the product,  and am satisfied."
4033,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"I upgraded from an iPhone 5 and wow what a difference. I didnâ€™t want to spend the money for a new phone so I went with this one, it didnâ€™t have an Apple box but I donâ€™t care about that. I received a phone that was in pristine shape no scratches, nics, or dents. It looked brand new and in fact still has Apples warranty until March. I did go ahead and get the insurance for the phone along with a screen saver and case all in all I would defiantly buy from here again."
4034,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,Worked perfectly after inserting SIM card.
4035,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,I really really like

4043,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,This phone came in much better shape then described! Absolutely so scratches whatsoever and it looks as if it is a brand new phone!! It even came with 3 months free Apple TV for â€œpurchasing a new iPhoneâ€! It really is like the phone was never used. Even came with a screen protector already installed onto the phone. Great product and great seller.
4044,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,BaterÃ­a 100%
4045,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,This phone came in MINT condition. No scratches whatsoever. Whatâ€™s even better is that the battery health was 99%! Iâ€™m 100% Happy with this purchase.
4046,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,"I had the IPhone 11 for two years and it was starting to die on me battery wise. So I took a leap of faith and got the 13 on Amazon for about a hundred dollars cheaper than buying it in store. It came perfect. Charger and all, no scratches or anything. I have had no issues in the 6 months Iâ€™ve had it."
4047,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,Muy buena inversiÃ³n.
4048,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,Everything
4049,Apple,IPhone 13,128 GB,IOS,6.1 Inches,Everything came out perfectly just one little scratch on the right top corner but itâ€™s barely visible overall the phone works and battery/camera is definitely worth the upgrade coming from an iPhone 8 plus.I didnâ€™t like how it did not have a iPhone box.
4050,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,Bought this for use as a low cost desk phone. Phone had obnoxious delay in responding to touch commands. Used for two months then T-Mobile notified they wanted phone off their network. Did a no cost swap to a low end but 5G smartphone from brand name manufacturer.
4051,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"This works very good the battery is good but, if you are someone would love to take pictures the camera is not that great. The camera, I don't like the way the camera it takes nice pictures but the quality of the pictures is not nice. The speakers are good everything about it is good except that I don't like the way the quality of the camera is."
4052,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"Works well in Jamaica. Doesn't take beautiful pics. Long battery life. Nice size, nice phone."
4053,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,This device is very horrible by all means...Incapable of connections to a 5G network wifi 2.4ghz ... the touch screen is very horrible and their customer support is worse than their device.Not to mention the battery dies fast and this device has been just outside the box and they kept saying I need to restore device to it's factory settings... hell I haven't able to setup anything cause I can't connected it to a wifi.and can't run android auto.It's a piece of garbage
4054,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,Para uso personal y estar mÃ¡s cerca de la familia
4055,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,The phone is too slow
4056,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"I thought because it's Blu and as described a co.parable with GSM network's phone. Yes the 16gb internal isn't near enough so I also order a huge as card to go with it! I get it contact my carrier and nothing. Won't connect, not compatible!! I am shocked but I could have made a mistake. I check my order in Amazon re-read description and yes I was right, says in black and white it a unlocked GSM co.parable phone. Next I went to the manufacturer website Blu.com and find the C5 Max and read all and you again it's a GSM compatible unlocked phone. Now I'm mad! Because now a day later in still out of a phone. I emailed their customer service people, useless! Took three days to get a ""In sorry to hear that emai! And take it up with Amazon!!""  Well no choice I get a refund after three people!!! Horrible experience!!  I will not ever purchase a phone from either p!ace. Not will I purchase another unlocked phone. Peop!e are selling 3g phones and forgetting to pull in off shelves! 3g doesn't work anywhere now and they are still being sold, beware what you but and if it seems to good to be true then it usually is. Don't purchase y'all your wasting ti me and money!!ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ’”ğŸ’”ğŸ’”ğŸ’”ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘"

4060,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,Makes phone calls fine but everything loads slow and all apps run slow.
4061,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"This is getting returned.Total and complete crap!When it does turn on it immediately says ""temperature is too low, phone will now shut down"" so I'm not even going to entertain it.  I'm sure there's a fix, but I refuse to ""fix"" something brand new.  I feel I should be paid to have even tried this piece of garbage."

I guess you get what you pay for
4069,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,It freezes like every 5 sec and EXTREMELY slow. Returning
4070,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,Not unlocked as specified for all carriers.
4071,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,Couldnâ€™t set up with phone company
4072,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"Phone is too slow. Any app slows the phone. I loose service on the phone almost never have a good connection. This is not the service, since I used the SIM card with other phones and it works great. I will be trying to return phone. Really not even worth for a simple use. Way and I mean way too slow."
4073,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,Personal
4074,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,I was looking for a cheap phone to take for a short-term visit abroad.  This phone just doesn't work.  It's too convoluted to set-up.  It shut down several times due to overheating just as I turned it on. I had to send it back.
4075,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"To make radio spectrum available for 5G phones, the 3G cellular network is being rapidly shut down.This is a 3G phone.Do not spend money on anything less than 4G LTE.  LTE is required for 4G voice calls."
4076,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,This phone was awful. It would not stay connected to network. Put sims card back in old phone and it worked fine. Don't need a replacement phone that works worse than new one
4077,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,Canâ€™t use with any carrier
4078,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"Bought this phone for my daughter and I safely say, with not exaggeration, that this is THE worst phone I have ever used. Battery life is complete garbage. It's incredibly slow and crashes frequently."
4079,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,HATE THE PHONE.
4080,BLU,C5 MAX,16 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,I bought this phone not knowing all the BS that comes with it. It is super slow the camera is like a phone from the early 2000s and the 32Gb is almost gone just from the software program to the phone it. It does not work with AT&T and the touch screen is so horrible it hardly works when I push the volume or power button I have to wait a will for it to work. I have never been so disappointed in Amazon as I am now. This is no doubt one of the worst phones you can buy.
4081,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"The S21+ blows the doors off of the S22 (based on this used S21+ compared to a new S22). If you're trying to decide, the S21+ is less expensive than the S22, and has a significantly better battery. Everything else about it is the same (but for the obvious size difference).As to the fingerprint reader they have on all their phones starting with the S10 models... !@&%!. Ridiculously awkward, unreliable, slow, etc... Absolutely ridiculous concept that barely works, yet they (and most other companies), have doubled down on it and ignored the mountains of complaints about its uselessness.... Samsung still makes the best phones."
4082,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Ordered the good condition which said screen does not have scratches. It comes with quite a lot of scratches on the screen.
4083,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I love this phone and being able to buy Samsung's Flagship phone for 2021 for only $500 is a big part of it. I bought my phone from Amazon renewed and have to say I can't find a scratch or one thing wrong with it's performance. The phone looks sleek and high end. The back of the phone is made of glass and I really like the weight and feel of it. The phone has an incredible display on it with that oled screen, and internet, using apps, etc are very quick and smooth. The battery lasts significantly longer than any other phones I have ever owned. They are offering this phone now for even less than I paid on Amazon renewed. Take the dive if your thinking about it and if by really bad luck you get something your not happy with Amazon is great at giving you time to do that with no hassle."
4084,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Excellent condition, fast response. After installing the screen protector the fingerprint reader response deteriorated."
4085,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,The battery runs out quicker than it should but other than that everything is perfect. Great value for money!
4086,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I have never tried a renewed Amazon phone but I will most definitely buy another one. This everything I want in a phone at half the cost.
4087,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Supero mis expectativas escelente estado fisico la pantalla impecable como nuevo
4088,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"excellent product, the only detail that could be improved is the packaging, they just put a plastic bag inside a box for the cell phone"
4089,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Was nervous buying a refurbished phone site unseen. Didn't need to be. The phone shipped lightning fast, a day early. Was shipped in a very sturdy box wrapped in bubble wrap. Phone itself was in awesome condition and after getting it ready, is running great. So if you need/want a phone but don't want to pay ridiculous current gen price, buy with confidence. I rarely leave ratings but I'm so happy with purchase."
4090,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,So far this replacement phone â˜ï¸ is living up to my expectations !!!!!! A lot to learn â€¦ expect to have this one a very long time. Thank you ğŸ˜Š
4091,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I paid over $150.00 extended warranty. I havent had the phone 9 months, I dropped it while getting out of my car at a rest stop. A car ran over it and smashed it. Its not covered even on the regular 1 year warranty because of it being run over. I am now traveling without a phone. I am a senior woman traveling alone with small dog and need a phone for emergencies. I lost all photos of family burial site in Missouri, pictures of the Smokey Mountains in Tennessee, family pictures of brother in NC. I am so sad that this accident happened and I lost my wonderful phone and the security it gave me while traveling. :-("
4092,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I think you cannot really go wrong with a flagship Samsung, great cameras and super quick. He never complains about a dead battery or lag anymore so yay!"
4093,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,The phone is okay but the charging adapter burnt because it wasn't the original charger for the phone.
4094,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Nothing
4095,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"So far, this phone is everything I needed.  Fingerprint works great,  it took a minute to figure out what I needed to do to receive and make calls,  but once I did a network update, It was up and running.  Was able to transfer all my apps, contacts and I formation with no trouble.  If I figured this out at my age (73), then anybody can do it and work this phone. Battery has lasted 2 days so far.  It's very new for me right now so may change my review layer and hoping it stays positive"
4096,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Bought a refurbished S21+. Mint condition,  looks brand new and for an excellent price. Amazon Refurbished is the way to go."
4097,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,The phone was gorgeous and functional. It just would not work with AT&T. Carrier store couldn't make it work. Call to AT&T tech support didn't help. Seller couldn't help. I am giving 3 stars for a timely refund. Not happy that it specifically mentions AT&T as a carrier that will work with this unlocked phone. Seller said that others had the same issue.
4098,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Bought these as a replacement for the S8 plus. Really liked that phone had it for 3 years, decided to upgrade. Purchased the s21plus thinking it would be a better phone. I did not realize that it does not have a SD card slot. I need the extra memory and do not like uploading to the cloud. Samsung discontinued their cloud and google and such charges, plus I like having my pictures on music on phone so they are accessible when in no coverage areas. It was a disappointing Christmas. Sent them back and purchased s20plus, which is by most categories a better phone plus it has sd support.If the Finger print scan is the same as the s20+, then you will be disappointed if you try to use a screen protector. The face recognition isalso  awfully on the s20+, so unless the fixed that...The phone arrived quickly and in pristine condition. Other than the phone limitation, the seller was great."
4099,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Great phone and came in like new condition. Very pleased
4100,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"My reviews are from a real, unpaid person...not a page of useless info.Took two to get one on this purchase, first one came with charging issues and some heavy scratching one USB port. Used Amazon 90 renewed items return and within days had the replacement which workf and looks great."
4101,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I was skeptical buying a renewed device but I got an amazing one! I upgraded from the Samsung s10+ and so far it's fantastic. Looks brand new, came with a charging cord and adapters. Switched it over to my carrier in under 10 min and everything has been working great ğŸ‘"
4102,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Works great, no issues"
4103,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I was moving over from Pixel XL and wanted to hop on the 5G wagon. I do unlocked phones only and unfortunately Google has chosen not to enable all 5G systems on their unlocked Pixel 6.. So went for Samsung for the first time. Very happy with this phone: I usually have more than 60% battery left in the evening! Streaming music and using s little navigation is no problem with the battery. The fingerprint reader isn't very good, but the usual screen pattern lock works all the same. This was a refurbished phone and came looking and working like new"
4104,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Phone was in better shape than expected.. Fairly new, so still havent messed with all features.. Well worth the money. Great communication and fast shipping"
4105,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I bought this phone for my husband as a father's day gift. Everything worked fine but he couldn't make nor receive calls. I contacted the seller and he immediately responded. I was able to return the phone and he sent me another one that works great. I'm very happy with this purchase.
4106,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Received my device,  unboxed and inspected it.Looks brand new,  can't find any flaws.Set it up, spent a good amount of time installing software updates, including new one UI version 4 and Android 12.Working as expected."
4107,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"i bought 2 renewed at a very lower price, $625 each. when it show up, was it NEW? look like NEW, ZERO scratch, all like NEW sticker were on the phone. did not look like it was used at all.so here we go, 1 phone got 30% power, plug in was okay BUT the other one is completely DEAD. It wont charge or show anything on screen when plug in charging cable.....was frustrated, thought i got a dead on arrival phone. the charger i was using was a fast charger 18W. so i plug in a slow charger 5w, and wow it start charging, left it til full. now using my fast charger, its working fine now.so far so good, we love it, like i said, it's a NEW PHONE.  we got 90 day if anything go south. hopefully it dont lolz."
4108,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"El producto me llegÃ³ en perfecto estado, vÃ­ varios comentarios que varios iban bloqueados, pero el mÃ­o si llego desbloqueado. Buena reseÃ±a"
4109,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Very happy with the purchase. Phone looked new no scratches no issues.
4110,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Perfect condition. Works great so far.
4111,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,So I love this phone but since I have received this phone it keeps rebooting and freeze when I'm using it I'm not sure why it is happening but I'm not thrilled about it I've got a renewed tablet off another seller with no problems so I was comfortable with renewed products until I have received this one ....now I'm starting to rethink that renewed is taking a chance that the product will work correctly or not
4112,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Back story: I left Samsung a while back and went to Google. So great price on this phone thought I would try it. Just not quite there for me. Cannot get it to connect to my Bluetooth devices but maybe 60% of the time. Tried resetting and tweaking the Bluetooth to no avail. I actually have Samsung chargers that I've been using for a while now but for whatever reason this phone gets super hot when it's charging. The camera, rocks! I just wish the rest of it fell into place. The seller and Amazon we're very good about the refund. Maybe someday Samsung will be the right phone for me."
4113,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"It was in great condition, but it was locked and had to return it."
4114,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Purchased this Samsung Galaxy S21+ 0n 4-27-22. Phone looked and worked great until this past weekend when I was taking photos while on a family vacation and the screen went black. Mind you I am very cautious with my phones. I use screen protectors, keep the phone in a lifeproof case at all times and diligently avoid crashes, spills, water, etc. This phone was no exception.  All this said, and honestly not terribly surprised knowing that the phone was refurbished,  I was stuck paying a $200 repair bill to replace the screen because (very conveniently) I am just outside of the 90 day return policy (25 days to be exact). I did contact the seller but did not have time to waste playing the roundabout game that would undoubtedly drag on for much longer than I was willing to be without a phone. Moral of the story,  learn from my mistake, spend the extra money on a new phone with a full warranty because you'll never know exactly why these phones were refurbished to begin with.."
4115,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"                    The media could not be loaded.
                



Â Me llegÃ³ mejor de lo que esperaba, comprÃ© el modelo de 128 gb segÃºn dice el anuncio, pero me llegÃ³ el de 256gb osea me ofrece el doble de lo que paguÃ© en memoria lo que se agradece, en la caja llegÃ³ totalmente nuevo, sellado, con su cable de carga y instrucciones, ademÃ¡s Amazon agregÃ³ una cabeza del cargador del iPhone 12 lo que se agradece. PorquÃ© de por si Samsung no te lo vende con la cabeza del cargador incluida y Amazon me agregÃ³ una cabeza de cargador nueva y nada mÃ¡s que la del iPhone 12."
4116,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"The phone is practically brand new, no marks no scratches. Came with a charger and cord, and was unlocked as described. This was definitely worth the price."
4117,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I would have to say I was skeptical from the other reviews but definitely 10/10 it came in absolute perfect condition and I love it. Everything works and everything is just wonderful. Compared to other prices and the condition I am so happy. The seller is definitely an OG for this!!!!
4118,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,This was better than described.  I have had the phone for over a week. Great battery life and no scratches or blemishes. Arrived on time.  Fingerprint scanner is phenomenal.
4119,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"The phone was trash, wouldn't interact with apps, wouldn't connect to the internet, BUT the original seller was great, responsive, considerate and immediately accepted my return..... Amazon on the other hand was trash, wouldn't help me at all with the return process and I had to travel and pay out of pocket for the return....."
4120,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"The phone was brand new, It looked like it was someone ordered it took the charger and sent it back. It cam with all original plastic covers the Sim card tool had never been used. Not a smug or scratch or it was new. It is just a few days open box. This is my favorite smartphone now, amazing phone, gaming's top notch, hella fast!!! ğŸ™‚ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘âœŒï¸"
4121,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I was hesitant to order this phone because I was not to sure how it would look or work but I have to say I'm gland that I made this decision to buy it.
4122,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"The description mentioned that it was ""unlocked"" but it turns out IT'S LOCKED TO AT&T AND I CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO UNLOCK IT. The battery drains fast and I expected a battery change or something. I'm absolutely disappointed and angry that a LOCKED PHONE THATS SUPPOSE TO BE ""UNLOCKED"" GOT SHIPPED TO ME."
4123,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Loving the S21+. The speed of phone is great and has a long battery life.  Best upgrade ever!
4124,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,The phone is in 9.5/10 condition. Battery 10/10 lasts all day. Almost like it's brand new.
4125,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,The battery is not good condition
4126,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Ordered outside of USA .  Turns out American version of 21 plus doesn't support second Sim neither esim . This was nowhere mentioned . Even amazon support didn't know that for sure . I had to call samsung support.  Finally I had to return . Two months passed meanwhile.All the model details should be described at the description.
4127,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"with so many service providers eliminating 3g, we brought the samsung  galaxy  s21 plus...these are great phones with a lot of new features  that our old phones did not have.I love the camera and no I'm  not a pro but for what we shoot they are beautiful."
4128,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,The phone I received was in perfect condition. Received quicker than expected.
4129,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Product works great, although the fingerprint reader after applying the protective glass kinda slow on recognition,  but face scanning is great"
4130,SAMSUNG,S21+ PLUS,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Small mishap with first phone but was fixed immediately
4131,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I purchased the unlocked version of the Pixel 6 Pro to replace my aging Samsung phone. I've used Samsung phones for years and this is the first time I've purchased a different brand. So far I've been quite happy with it. This being the Google flagship phone (at the time), it is a great value. It was at least $400 less than the Samsung counterpart.With that being said, on to the good and bad:Pros:Camera is awesome (near pro grade). Unbelievably clear photos with tons of editing options built inThe fingerprint sensor works great. I always had problems with my Samsung phones using my fingerprint to sign into apps. Never been a problem with this phoneBattery life is really good. I heard a lot of negative comments regarding battery life, but it looks like Google figured it out with one of the updates. Holds a charge much longer than my previous phonesHaving come from the Samsung ecosphere, the interface needs some getting used to. But is good overall with a few exceptionsCons:The phone radio is not great. I live in a rural area and my old phone would have a connection in areas where this phone does not.The Gmail client just seems kind of clunky after getting used to the Samsung mail app. It is a pain using multiple mailboxes with Gmail. I'm constantly (i.e. EvErY SiNgLe TiMe) having to go to the hamburger menu and go to all mailboxes to see the inbox of my all accounts.The messaging app is weird. You have to create a group instead of just adding names to a message. Doesn't sound like much of an issue until you try sharing something and don't have a group set up before hand. You have to stop, set up the group, then go back to the app and reshare whatever it was. Groups are more difficult find as well.Really miss the close all apps option at the bottom of the all apps screen. Now I have to scroll right all the way to the end of the open app to find the close all button Big 'ol PITAI wouldn't hesitate to purchase a future Pixel phone and would highly recommend it to anyone"
4132,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,The product was 95% as advertised. it came in in excellent shape not one blemish on the device. I wish the included charger and cable were a little more high quality as it they don't support the full charge rate. however that is not a problem at all. they are fully compatible and work just fine.The hiccup in this transaction was the unlocked device part. When my device arrived it was carrier locked to ATT which posed a problem for me. I notified the seller and they were prompt with their replies. No problems with communication. I had already started the unlock procedure through ATT by the time I contacted the seller. The seller immediately went through their records and also started a second unlock request just to be on the safe side. I have seen unlocks not 'stick' on a device before so it is hard to say whether the seller was at fault or not. At the end of the day I received a great device at a great price. if it weren't for the hiccup I would have given a solid 5 stars.TLDRDevice was a great price and was basically new in box condition. Wasn't unlocked when received but that was remedied. Seller communicated and was generally great.
4133,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Was skeptical at first since it's a refurbished phone, but this phone is in perfect condition, not a single blimish on it and works perfectly. It's like a brand new phone. The packaging ensured the phone didn't move around and get damaged and was wrapped for added protection. The camera on this phone is absolutely spectacular. Battery life is solid. EDIT: after having this phone for a bit, there are a few things that I find annoying whish is why I lowered my rating for this phone. For whatever reason the notification tab will mess up and only show a couple tabs to select but will NOT scroll all the way down for all the other options. Very annoying bcuz the settings button is at the bottom of it along with power options for the phone(turn off, restart). And the only way to fix that notification tab issue is to restart the phone. And you can NOT get into power options via the power/lock button on the side. That ONLY will turn on the phone.  And the Bluetooth interface is weird and adds unnecessary steps for answering calls with Bluetooth. And if you want to connect to BT, there isn't an option for it once your in a call. u HAVE to scroll the notification tab bar and go from there. And use of the gallery is not good. Had to download an app for it. If those things don't bother you, then enjoy this phone. But if so. Just stick with Samsung."
4134,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"First off it took forever to arrive, not that I'm that disappointed just that it's a think to know.I have had the phone for a month now and it's served me very well. It did scare the crap out of me when it didn't charge, I thought the port was dead. Nope the charger cord it came with didn't work. Not the biggest deal but the little things add up.Over all the phone itself is great"
4135,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Very good phone, great battery life, and great pictures. The thumbprint on the front of the screen is kind of a drag but it is what it is."
4136,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"For context, I've always been a fan of the cheaper ""knock-off"" models of flagship phones. You know the ones, that were banned from secure places repeatedly in the US.  Well after years of dealing with my last one, I gave this phone a shot.I have never been happier with a phone purchase. The price is reasonable, the camera is amazing, connectivity has been great (my old phone used to drop calls), and Did I mention Google makes Quality of Life updates and actually tells you what the update is doing? It's great. I'm one of those people who only make phone purchases when their last one is pretty much dead (5+ years between phones)."
4137,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Another home run by Google. Feels solid. Haven't had any issues with it. Visual Voicemail working fine with my prepaid carrier (Tello). The camera punch hole at the top of the screen does not bother me 99% of the time, so good enough. High quality camera works very well."
4138,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I like the phone. Very fast and functional. Screen has good brightness outside. Speakers are great. But the curved screen does not work well with a simple silicone case with raised edges that protect the screen. I will not get another phone with a curved screen.
4139,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I bought this phone as  refurbished , but it had all the accessories, a warranty and looks like brand new . I Saved $200 over the price of the same phone if I bought it brand new - very happy with my purchase."
4140,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I was still running on an Galaxy S8, yea, needed an upgrade.  I got mine a reconditioned one so the price I paid was the same as the non pro model.  Budget wise I was planning on spending the cost of the regular 6 but couldn't justify the additional cost for the camera upgrade.  I'm just not a big camera user.  BUT! when I seen the reconditioned on for the same price, you bet I jumped on that.  THIS THING IS AWESOME! Ok, maybe I'm being over dramattic but it is a very nice phone.  My S8 had a brighter screen, but the resolution on the 6Pro is awesome.  Typically I only run about 50% anyways. So if your a person that is always in the sun then might not be as nice. But who is anyway. GET THE FREAKIN P!HONE! Yes the finger print scanner on the 6Pro is not as fast as the one on my S8 but it's still pretty fast.  Sometimes I feel like it doesn't wake up on first touch but I think I'm just no pressing hard enough. And the battery life... OMG.... Awesome. Let be known that I'm not one that is always on my phone but I do have to do a lot of 2FA stuff for work so i am waking it up many times during the work day. But I don't play on it during work either. OH! and the bluetooth range is awesome.  Twice the distance of my S8, so much that when I was walking outside my home and suddenly realized I didn't have my phone on me but my music was still jamming.  Yes it's a little bit larger than the Galaxy S8 (but what phone today isn't, LOL). But after using the Pixel 6Pro for a few days I had to get something off my S8 and it felt tiny. LOL.  Did I tell you yet..... BUY THE PHONE! LOL. Good luck."
4141,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Buying a refurbished phone is a smart choice for getting the phone you want for a great price!  Phones are both pristine.  They arrived quickly and were well packaged.  The chargers could be more powerful, but we have others that get the job done quickly!  Fulfillment by havEarly.  Great company to deal with!  The phones are great!  Fast.  Reliable fingerprint reader.  Excellent camera!"
4142,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,No scratches. Phone functioning normally. It's unlocked. But get overheated easily while playing games or long activity.
4143,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,So glad to return to Pixel after 3 yrs with one plus. Runs slightly hot but not problematic. The finger print sensor was fine without screen protector. Took a few tries to set up with protector but working fine now. Like the overall design. Price was good. Not a fan of the curved sides but that is minor.
4144,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"There's a lot about the Pixel 6 pro to love. The sleek design is tops.This phone is responsive and fast. I'm not a gamer, but I watch a lot of video. I don't think I'll ever want another phone."
4145,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I was a little hesitant about buying a refurb phone, I've always bought brand new phones only, but I saved $110 and it works great and looked brand new.So far so good."
4146,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,The phone is in mint condition but the battery definitely needs replaced. Not super thrilled about this and pretty upset.
4147,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I continue to be impressed with Amazon's renewed devices.  This Pixel 6 Pro is indistinguishable from new.  Couldn't be happier with the phone, screen size, performance, and battery life."
4148,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Don't be misled by nitpicky critics. The Google pixel 6 pro is a phenomenal phone.  Even the fingerprint reader works perfectly for me, and I was skeptical at first having a bad experience several years ago with the Samsung S9. So not only is the hardware top of the line, but you get all the wonderfully performing functions that Google provides. The only problem I am having is finding a screen cover that does not interfere with the fingerprint reader and the touch responsiveness of the display around the edges. I suspect the curved edges that give the phone an elegant look make it harder for manufacturers to design a screen cover. Anyway, I am enjoying the phone and if it continues working reliably I will be very happy with my purchase."
4149,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,The google operating system is a little differnt to get used too.
4150,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Phone virtually brand new. I don't agree with all the negative reviews. It's a solid phone. My previous phone was a pixel 4. Not that much different sadly. If I had to sight negative aspects it would be beveled edges. It's pretty but just begging to bump into something and makes holding the phone akward. Also makes the display more expensive and require you to use weird screen protectors that suck. But the battery life Iife is awesome as is the speed. Very happy. Also quite surprised that the fingerprint reader works very well after all the negative reviews.
4151,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I was really skeptical of buying a refushed device but then went I could get a refund if I didn't turn out to be what I want it to be and I'll definitely be having any of my other family member use Amazon refushed to save on there phones with afirm and shipping didn't take that long to come from and here it came in within a week later
4152,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Pictures I took were colorless.  No matter what I tried, no matter what the settings.  Googled till I was googled out to find a solution.  Bought the camera specifically for a fall colors trip through Door County.  My friend and I compared pictures of the same things and no comparison.  She has to share all of her photos  with me.  Only had it  a very short while and am totally disgusted."
4153,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Was worried about being refurb, but it was as good as now for less money. Fast a clean. Hate the bevel edges, but what can you do?Have not tried the face rec."
4154,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"If you want the IOS experience from Android, this is the one! The phone arrived in perfect condition, like brand new! And even with an official charger, something that if you buy it new will not be included."
4155,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,It's a pixel 6 pro.  Phone arrived in unoriginal box.  It was pristine and I couldn't tell it had been used.  It was not unlocked so I can use google pay.  Camera is amazing.
4156,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I've only had my Google pixel 6 pro for a few short weeks, but I'm very pleased with it. It has so many features. I haven't even learned half of them yet. It lives up to its expectations as far as the camera goes and many people with these iPhones want to use my camera enough said"
4157,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Pros: takes amazing pictures and has awesome features.Cons: fully charged, the battery life is only 3 to 4 hours"
4158,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I ordered the Pixel 6 Pro as ""renewed"".  The phone I got was flawless.  No scratches dents or anything.  The phone is working great.  A seller called Bayshine Trading fulfilled the order and they were helpful.  I'm happy with the purchase."
4159,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I wanted a pixel 6 pro, but didn't want the contract associated with a discount. This was the perfect alternative! It looks and acts brand new."
4160,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"When I went to set up the phone it was carrier locked to Verizon. After a couple hours trying to get through to their support, they tell me that they can't unlock it unless I have the account details for the original owner.I also purchased the ""excellent quality"" version which is supposed to have no visible defects from 12"" away or more. The screen and back glass look great, but unfortunately the device frame is very scuffed and it looks horrible.It also took over 10 days for the phone to be shipped out. Very disappointed with the purchase overall."
4161,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Very good phone
4162,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,This is beautiful and runs great.  It is not unlocked.  Went to T-Mobile and they said it will not work
4163,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"My google pro 6 came with an unlocked bootloader.  This means that if I lose the phone and the person that stole the phone has any knowledge of Android development, then he can hack the phone and get my credentials.  Basically, the phone can be hacked easily regardless of the security features.  An unlocked bootloader will void Google's warranty.  It will not enable Google pay on the phone which I use often.  This should have been noted in the advertising about the issues with an unlocked phone.  I did like the phone overall, but now I have to go through the hassle of returning this."
4164,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I needed this product, waited 5 days for it, just to open the box and see the phone not even turn on .  The company does not  show professionalis I wish I could rate 0 stars"
4165,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"This phone was advertised as an unlocked phone but when I put my sim card into it, it said that it was locked to AT&T."
4166,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,The only thing that is better than my previous Pixel is the camera.  The actual phone part sucks.  I am using Skype instead of my phone these days
4167,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Advertised as unlocked. It was locked to Affinity Mobile, couldn't use with either of my carriers."
4168,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Phone was in great condition and all, but it was locked."
4169,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"The main reason why I bought this phone is because of its photographic heritage. I had the Pixel 4, which was a great cameraphone with an awful battery life.  This new Pixel 6 Pro is almost everything I could want in a cameraphone, except for the fingerprint reader. After applying a tempered glass protector, increasing the fingerprint sensitivity to compensate, opening the phone with the fingerprint reader is hit or miss. It often fails to recognize my fingerprint (my thumb's). I deleted the stored fingerprints, re-entered and it's still hit or miss. I'm hoping the phone will eventually get used to my fingerprint."
4170,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I got my cell phone the day it came out. Since the first minute I had the phone in my hand... multiple problems: hyper scrolling, turns on assistant by itself, constantly listening (turned off) screen doesn't lock, freezing and other issues. Got a replacement phone that had same issues, I just bought an iPhone"
4171,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Software bugs galore , fingerprint reader works about 30% of the time , no face unlock , if you use the Esim and physical sim ringtone is the same. NOT recommended."
4172,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Review de mi experiencia de compra en Amazon Renewed:La verdad es que he tenido una experiencia agridulce. Para empezar, tardÃ³ casi un mes desde que lo comprÃ© para que me llegara a mi casa.Cuando abrÃ­ la caja, quedÃ© decepcionado ya que la caja en la que viene es completamente genÃ©rica, carece de estÃ©tica y da la sensaciÃ³n de hacer comprado un producto de baja calidad.VenÃ­a con un cargador de la mara motorola y un cable usb tipo c. La verdad es que la presentaciÃ³n es muy pobre.Al momento de sacarlo de la caja, me percatÃ© de unas marcas en la pantalla, pero eran solo de suciedad y sobre la mica (incluye una mica de plÃ¡stico de bastante mala calidad), se agradece que tenga mica ya que se protege la pantalla antes de comprarle una mica de mejor calidad. TambiÃ©n estaba muy sucio el telÃ©fono, pues estaba lleno de huellas por todos lados, se veÃ­a todo manoseado.Se supone que es restaurado, pero no parece que lo hayan limpiado. Los altavoces estÃ¡n llenos de polvo, asÃ­ como los micrÃ³fonos y el puerto de carga.TambiÃ©n tiene detalles como que estÃ¡ despostillado de los marcos, asÃ­ como de los botones de desbloqueo y volumen. Los marcos superiores tienen marcas tambiÃ©n.De la parte trasera de cristal, hay marcas como de rayones y estÃ¡ un poco picado, como si lo hubieran puesto sobre una superficie arenosa o con piedras. TambiÃ©n se puede apreciar que, en la cÃ¡mara, a los costados tiene rayones, pero la parte de los lentes estÃ¡ en perfectas condiciones.SÃ© que es renovado, pero por el precio y por el tiempo, realmente esperaba un mejor empaque y que al menos hubiesen limpiado las hendiduras, los puertos y el dispositivo en general.Review del Celular:Es un celular que me ha gustado mucho, sin duda la mejor experiencia en software que he probado.Es un telÃ©fono rÃ¡pido y fluido, y ofrece una experiencia en android completamente inigualable. PrÃ¡cticamente no tiene bugs y funciona al instante. Android 13 es una maravilla visual y utilitariamente.La cÃ¡mara es increÃ­ble. Toma fotos espectaculares y el procesado que da por software es verdaderamente bueno es las diferentes condiciones de luz.La pantalla es muy fluida, responde rÃ¡pidamente, aunque me gustarÃ­a que tuviera un poco mÃ¡s de brillo ya que casi siempre lo tengo que tener a mÃ¡s de la mitad del brillo, de lo contrario casi no se visualiza la pantalla.El sonido es envolvente y rotundo, aunque me gustarÃ­a que fuera un poco mÃ¡s alto ya que casi siempre escucho audio a mÃ¡s de la mitad del volumen, de lo contrario se escucha muy bajo.La baterÃ­a es media. La verdad es que vengo de un Xiaomi Mi A2 del 2018 y tenÃ­a 4000mAh y tenÃ­a que cargarlo al menos 4 veces por dÃ­a. Con este Pixel 6 Pro es casi lo mismo. Debo cargarlo mÃ¡s de 2 veces para que me rinda la baterÃ­a y eso que no juego ni consumo mucha multimedia. Lo utilizo para cosas mucho mÃ¡s sencillas como llamadas, whatsapp, productividad, ver algunos videos en youtube, escuchar mÃºsica en spotify, y ver netflix. Me ha decepcionado un poco esa parte.El lector de huellas falla mucho, pero es debido a que es un sensor Ã³ptico y no uno sÃ³nico, esta tecnologÃ­a Ã³ptica tiende a fallar mucho, pero la verdad es que no me quejo. Cumple su funciÃ³n.La verdad es que estoy mÃ¡s que satisfecho porque cumple y lo hace muy bien, mereciÃ³ la pena ya que estaba en un super descuento.Para concluir, puedo decir que el telÃ©fono es increÃ­ble, me encantÃ³ y le doy 5 estrellas. Sin embargo, aquÃ­ le doy 3 debido al servicio de Amazon renewed, ya que, a mi parecer, tienen muy bajos estÃ¡ndares de calidad y presentaciÃ³n."
4173,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Had to return this as it came locked to an AT&T network
4174,Google,Pixel 6 Pro,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Phone was not unlocked and would not connect to my network carrier ""SIM card isn't supported"" and then suggests I contact AT&T. Furious and frustrated. Make this right Amazon!!!"
4175,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"This is the fourth tablet I have owned and have been using it heavily for business and recreation (I am not a gamer) for 2 months and am extremely happy with the purchase.  The features I was looking for were size (not too large), good performance, low price, ample  Ram/memory, SD card support, good screen resolution, modern dual band WiFi, good camera, GNSS support.This came as close to my ideal as I could find and the added bonus of inbuilt unlocked 4G LTE was unexpected but I tested (Trafone prepaid SIM and service $21) and it works fine though holding a 9"" smartphone to your ear is attention-getting.Add-ons I have augmented this tablet with include a Tracfone nano-SIM, a Gigastore 256 GB micro SD, ivoler glass screen protector, armor suit anti-glare film (layered on the glass screen protecto - both easy to install with no bubbles - and touch screen works fine), a Puxicu matte silicone cover, and a Finte universal hand strap.  I recommend them all.I consider myself a heavy user and have installed about 40 apps (only one was a game) and this tablet has not choked once.  The battery is good for more than 3 days.The only minor negatives I would mention are the lack of USB 3.0 support (the USB-C port is 2.0), the lack of HDMI support, and the fact the cameras are only good but not excellent.All in all I recommend this tablet and would definitely buy it again."
4176,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"Buen dÃ­a compre Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" para ver los videos de prime video en la tv pero la conexiÃ³n que compre no funciona. Me gustarÃ­a que me recomendara una que si funciona."
4177,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,When power on boots up longer
4178,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,takes awhile to start up
4179,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,Nice tablet. I really enjoy its slim design.
4180,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,Needed a basic tablet for work.  This works well for that.  I like that I can put it on my cell plan.  The only quirk is that I cannot change the temperature to Fahrenheit on the weather app.  This table came with a sticker on the box that indicated it was for Africa.  I wonder if that is why it is only Celsius.  But it's not a deal breaker.  I found videos on Youtube on how to change the temperature but that option is not on this tablet.
4181,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"If you are used to having a flash (LED) with your phone, be advised that this phablet does not have one.  I found out when I installed a flashlight app."
4182,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"I've been using the Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" for almost two months. The functions of this phablet works similarly to the other Samsung phones I had. However, the battery life isn't as good as my previous Samsung phablet that I could use (phone calls, watching videos, web searching,etc...) for over five days after a full charge. This Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" take roughly four to five hours to fully charge but the battery life would only last for around two and a half days when I use it the same way I used my previous Samsung phablet. The battery life is the only real disappointment."
4183,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,A mi hijo leGusto y tambiÃ©n le puedes colocar chip de telÃ©fono
4184,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,great gift for my grandson.
4185,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"This is a great tablet for cruising the inet, used smart switch to import all data and apps in minutes. Took sim out my my android phone installed with 128gb sd micro card and the tablet has all my phone contacts ,messages data ready to go. My sim is att and calls out and receives calls perfectly. You do have to be on speaker phone to use but you can always use Bluetooth ear piece for privacy.. This is a great unit for the average web surfer,if you are going to use a tablet for business then you will want a tab that has more ram and gigs of storage. I bought this for buying stuff online, playing on the inet and to have the phone ability. It took all of fifteen minutes to load cards and smart switch my devices. Also you can use your old Samsung phone charger so it will quick charge instead of the included Charger.  To keep it protected I highly recommend the unicorn beetle case as it is mil spec and has a built in s screen protector. I do not play games but that may need a tablet with more power? All in all this tablet does everything I need. Hope this helps."
4186,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"I bought this for my daughter and she really loves it,only problem is the back  camera not so good."
4187,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,I totally love this tablet. I purchased just to have an extra device for home and on the go but mainly I wanted to have another phone alternative. I wanted a smaller tablet. I took my time searching and reading all the reviews. I installed a sim card and activated a prepaid plan. This tablet is very functional for me. Making calls works. Highly recommend if your looking for a quality budget tab. It's does what I need it to do. It's a 2 in one win win.
4188,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"Love the size of this pad ... and most of the LTE functionality works exactly as expected (i.e., phone calls and text). That said, while the pad has VoLTE support it apparently the unlocked version of the pad DOES NOT appear to support WiFi Calling (according to Samsung Support).  The VoLTE slider/controls disappeared when the pad upgraded itself from Android 11 to 12.  For those who need to toggle VoLTE on/off or change the LTE bands, there is still the option of using Samsung key-codes from the phone keypad (so it's not impossible ... just less convenient than using the ""Samsung Band Selection"" app (which broke for the same reason, due to the upgrade to 12). While VoWiFi is important to me, I decided to keep this pad because [so far] I haven't found an unlocked inexpensive alternative with equivalent features!"
4189,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,I would recommend this productâ€¦
4190,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,The system works great but is slow in general.
4191,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"I got this to use as my door dash device. The bigger screen for gps was good, the image is nice. The biggest downfalls are ram and internal storage. Internal storage is taken 50% of just system software. Then, you can't install apps on your ad card for some reason, because it's an android.There's only 2 gb ram and if you Doo too much with it, it really slows down. But as an internet tablet, reader, streaming, etc, it's okay if you're using it for one purpose. But don't expect to have Spotify going while you browse Amazon as your pages will load super slow and navigating the screen is bogged down."
4192,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"Arrived on time, the screen has no cover to protect  and has a little scracth on the screen and no data but u can call and text only works in att and its not unlocked. White label sticker  at the back of the device is russia cant understand it. And slow on wifi"
4193,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"Tablet works fine. I have another one, the S6 that I use for serious things. For the purpose for which I bought this, to have a tablet with lte that I could use when I don't want to carry my other tablet, it works quite well."
4194,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"OK, for those who want a ""Super Tablet"" this is not the option, this is a basic tablet for streaming, some light gaming and checking social netwoks, making phone calls...light, sturdy and reliable, no issues at all.  Price is great knowing that is a Samsung brand, for me it meets my needs."
4195,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,ok
4196,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,Tablet worked fine but says network and wifi. Upon taking it to AT&T they said it was not compatible with their systems and could not be linked.
4197,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,Excellent
4198,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,8.7 -inch machine is a little big system is very slow
4199,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"I bought this tablet and as they specified in the description it's a international model.  After checking the firmware installed on tablet i found actually that the model is SM-T225N and correspond as a region to Pakistan. The firmware number is T225NDXU1AUJ1. This tablet worked satisfactory for me , also as a phone using a TMobile sim card, making calls, in Chicago area. Also 4G LTE works good with TMobile sim card in my area."
4200,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"Itâ€™s very good for the  amount I paid, itâ€™s hard to get used to it not familiar how to used it. Iâ€™m used to have an apple Ipad. But itâ€™s not bad love it."
4201,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"Email, on line bill payments, video such as movies and internet"
4202,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"Soooooo, I don't think I would buy something like this again, lol probably for a child ill make the investment but not for my personal use.....I wanted something jus to run my business with, and I mean, for the price atleast it works, but it just does not stand up to something that i should be using. It lags and is slow and some how, the on board storage is almost full and it hardly has anything on the device!!!! Currently I'm looking to resell! If I had known better I would've invested more money into a better device."
4203,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,Good for web searches and mail. Nice for the cost. Battery seems to last.  For those who want to connect with AT&T you will need to set your APN settings and have a data only ( no voice) phone line established. I went to the AT&T store and as another person stated tried several sim cards which showed connection to the tower but I could not recieve data via cell. He worked for AT&T for many years but was stumped. Left the card installed to see if it would hook up after an hour our so. No luck. Tried many APN suggested settings on the internet. No luck. What I then discovered was the APN settings on my old locked to AT&T tabe 4 was the ticket to access my data only phone connection / number. This may work for those who have an AT&T data cell phone number.
4204,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"Best value for the price. BUT check your carrier.I have been having problems with Mint though I live in a major metro.This Tablet dropping calls, and very poor quality on Mint.  I had to switch back to my old phone.Will update as I get to use it."
4205,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,Wanted this for a while now to upgrade one of my Metro PCS lines. Description says Cellular and I can say as I write this that I'm able to dial out and make calls like a regular cell phone. My main reason for getting this is to have my second line function as BOTH a tablet and phone without having to pay for a dedicated tablet line. Switched SIM from phone to tablet from Metro's website. NO store visit required.
4206,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"I got this for my grandson and he's just thrilled with it. Does everything he wants it to do, and more."
4207,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,WHAT IS IT POWER CYCLING! ONLY HAD IT 2 MONTHS
4208,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"This item is awesome ğŸ‘Œ exactly  what I expected  though  I didn't  notice that it didn't  come with a flash,but it is a tablet  after all everything  running  smooth good graphics .videos like bit sharp or lil bit blury but that 480p otherwise  theis device is perfect  im loving it.shoots I'm writing  this  review  on it right now ğŸ˜„ ğŸ˜Š"
4209,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"BaterÃ­a duradera, precio excelente , el face recognition no lo utilizo. Es muy buena tablet."
4210,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"This tablet/mobile device is a surprisingly capable, affordable and decently performing hybrid model when used with generous sized sd card and cellular provider SIM card with data and text and calling services.  Protect screen with glass protection and with flexible outer  casing shock absorbing protection. Good entry level device certainly not an iPad mini but not bad for what it is. Good companion device for iPhone 6.1 inch if you want larger screen for better reading and viewing."
4211,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,Iâ€™m surprised how affordable this was. My mom loves it.
4212,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,Es muy util
4213,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"Wow right, size and covers what I need to do. I added the watch and number shared with my carrier and no longer carry a phone. Whew, amen! It's been a week and It works well."
4214,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,Very happy with the size and quality of the phone.  Works perfectly and the speaker is clear and crisp sounding.
4215,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,Claims to be unlocked but the IMEI is not compatible with T-Mobile or sprint.
4216,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"I own several Samsung Galaxy products. This unit worked, however compared to my other units (Galaxy Tab 10.5 and my Galaxy S10+ phone) this units display is poor. Slow response. Would sometimes launch random things on it's own. This was returned due to this. The Cellular option worked fine as well as WIFI. Just didn't fit my expectations and needs."
4217,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,"I purchased this tablet because it was 4 g and my old 3g galaxy tab was being phased out. Super easy set up, great screen and sound quality. I only use for basic things but it is fast and the battery is long lasting. I hope this lasts as long as my old galaxy tablet, so far so good. You will not regret purchasing this."
4218,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,I only had this item for a few days but it's working great so far and the battery life is long. Hopefully this device me will last a long time.
4219,SAMSUNG,A7 Lite,32 GB,Android,8.7 Inches,Brought it to ATT and they states this tablet is not compatible.This one is compatible with ATT LTE https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0971SCNMG?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1

Â I had a samsung Tab A, it was an international version.2019 model, 3g service is now gone, my tablet worked well until 3g signal isn't supported now, so I bought this 2021 Samsung tablet A7, it says makes calls.I went to ATT and cricket, neither service works.It isn't unlocked or supported for either service.The information on the site say GSM unlocked, it is not.You can go to ATT and order the same tablet, or very close for 199 bucks and pay ATT 21 dollars a month for 5g service, 21 dollars is an add on account50 buck for main service. Sim card is supplied in ATT tablet boxI can't go back to a little phone now, I use Talkatone for back up phone service, the Samsung software does has a dedicated phone application.I love my big phone, never want a little phone again."

4225,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"Well, first let me preface my review on saying I don't use this as my main phone, I use this more as a storage partner to lighten the load on my main one. I still haven't put a sim card in it but it does damn near everything without one! I use my wifi and can do everything I do on my main phone faster and with a much bigger screen.This phone came in excellent condition and it works amazing! It was worth every penny and then some! You're always a little skeptical when you buy anything used, let alone something that was formerly damaged, repaired, and then re-sold. But, as I said before, it was meant as my side-phone so as long as the storage I had heard about with this phone held true the cosmetics and things of that nature didn't matter. But the fact that it came looking like a brand new phone was truly icing on the cake. I initially was just going to get the Note 10, I had ordered it and everything and then in the process of looking into what memory card I was going to get along with some of the accessories people favored, I saw some people had said they hated that it didn't come with a memory slot. And I was like wait, what!!! I thought I had done my homework on it and missed that entirely and that was a deal breaker for me. Needless to say I canceled that one and ordered this 1 and I'm extremely glad I did.I'm a check to make sure I put the right seller I bought from bcuz I wanna make sure they get the credit they deserve and hopefully I help bring them business. And here's to also hoping you guys get the same quality phone then I ended up with bcuz we all kno everybody's experiences are different. But I have no gripes with this phone at all. I'm even getting used to the power button on the left side of the phone. Lolz, its starting to make using my regular one feel kinda wierd. Smh.But I ordered mine from Chubbiestech. I think I spelled that right. But shouts to them, amazing quality phone, that came fast, and theres honestly no bad things I could say about it. The phone it was replacing was a J7 Samsung Galaxy Prime, which is prehistoric now. Lol. And I was just gonna get another one of them bcuz it was just meant for storage and I was used to using it for that purpose for many a year, but 200 dollars for an old and used phone.... This was literally going from the stone ages to the Matrix in 0 to 60 seconds. But anyway, I hope this review helped sway at least a few people. It's a great buy for that price!Oh, and I didn't rate the face recognition bcuz I still haven't used it. I'll come back if I ever decide to. But stuff like that isn't that important to me."
4226,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"It looks like a brand new phone. Can't recommend it enough.Very small issues:The only thing that I would suggest, would be that it came with the sim card tray ejector... I borrowed it from someone and ejected the sim card tray...When I started the phone it said that it was locked with verizon and I was confused since I ordered an unlocked phone, but when I inserted the sim it automatically got unlocked and started working.Again, the phone looks like brand new and everything works perfectly. I can't recommend it enough!"
4227,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"Absolutely beautiful phone. I have searched an waited months because I was skeptical about purchasing. My old phone had its final hard hit to the floor, an it was done. So I had to make a quick decision. After 3 days, so far so good.Seller was quick responding to questions an concerns.Phone is in EXCELLENT condition, the color is just as beautiful in hand as it is on amazon. No issues switching Sim card. I have t-mobile prepaid, FYI."
4228,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Good overall. Screen only has one small scratch. Body only has a little damage. Everything else looks OK.My testing says battery is at 77% health. Product listing said 80+ and case it came in said 86%. The pen also always does not connect to the phone at all. It still works as a pen for my phone but I cannot use the pen gestures as it doesn't connect to my phone.
4229,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"I am hesistant buying electronics on line but I went for its amazon and it shouldn't be an issue and it wasnt everything as described works great after replacing my s21 5g that got no signal, now my signal is great."
4230,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Excellent product fast shipping
4231,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,I ordered this phone so I didn't have to get a 5g phone since it is very spotty and I was surprised at the quality. I would definitely consider Amazon renewed products in the future
4232,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"I have been using my phone 1 month and it is working fine, when it arrived it was in like new condition.I am very pleased with my phone."
4233,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"I have been looking for a different phone for a mo but I couldn't find anything unlocked and new within my price range. When I saw the certified pre-owned, I was a bit skeptical but Amazon has a decent return policy so I figured it was worth the shot.Y'all. I am beyond impressed with the quality. I saw a couple of reviews about minuscule scratches, nothing I needed to worry about. It's not like I was buying a brand-new phone or spending 1000 dollars. The condition is magnificent with a very VERY minor scratch in the bottom corner that I wouldn't have noticed had it not been tilted in the light just right. I have a quality screen protector, it's not even noticeable now.I was even more impressed with the fact that I could get phone insurance through Amazon. 36 months of protection on a used phone? For only 4 dollars a month?? Yes, please!I haven't set up face recognition yet, but the fingerprint scanner has been working splendidly. The camera has magnificent detail, the screen is large and beautiful. Definitely looking for this store in the future!"
4234,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"I was anticipating my phone to be delivered no later than Friday, it arrived today Wednesday!  Device looks in great shape and booted right up with AT&T services when I placed my current sim and sd cards from my prior device.  Just in time too, my other phone was dropped and shattered screen a few days ago; was in need of a replacement fast.Thank you for providing above and beyond.  highly recommend the seller"
4235,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Phone works as it should all functions and buttons and features work . I'm happy with my purchase other than the color. I ordered a black one and they sent me a silverish one with a big scratch down the back of the phone. Put a phone cover over it now I can't see it. That's my only gripe.  Other then that phone works Great!
4236,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,I bought this phone as a gift for my techie son with my fingers crossed. He loved the features (the bells and whistles). I can't tell you about the phone all I can say is he likes it very much since it is vital for his work.
4237,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Was a tad worried based on a few reviews that I've seen but I took the plunge and I'm glad I did. Phone is in great condition with no problems. Looks brand new. I'm typing this review on it right now lol highly recommend this seller.
4238,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"The ""renewed"" Note 10+ is an amazing device for an affordable price. This phone offers a better build quality than mid-priced new phones for even less money. The large 6.8"" UHD display produces and amazing viewing experience for watching videos. I don't think the phone is 5G but I don't care 4G LTE provides enough bandwidth to stream 4k video on my phone. In my opinion unless your some sort of poweruser 5G is just a gimmick smart phone manufactuers came out with to entice people to buy new phones they don't need when for the vast majority of users will never notice the defference plus most areas don't have 5G yet so you only connect in 4G LTE anyway also the 5G chips use more power draining the battery life. The camara is excellent for most. The phone does lack 120 hertz display which is the only reason I would upgrade to a more current model. My phone arrived in mint condition with no scratches. This is the second phone I bought as ""renewed"" my last was the S9+ which was also in perfect condition. I upraded to get a larger screen and couldn't be happier. Since the price of the S9+ was prumited recently, I gave the old phone to an economically challenged friend in need of a better phone. They love the phone. I love my new purchase and am very satisfied with my decision to upgrade. It was very easy to transfer all of my apps, photos, texts, etc with the Samsung Smart Transfer app but it did take 14 hours to compleate the transfer process. It even kept most of my settings and home screen layout so there was no learning curve. I will never buy a new phone again and will trust Amazon ""Renewed"" for all my future smart phone purcheses."
4239,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"Phone is great, its snappy, no cracks or scrapes, works with my Metro By T-Mobile sim card, thing is performing wonderful, however, this is definitely a situation where you get what you paid for, after only taking out about 10 to 15 times, the tip has broken, and I wasn't pushing hard, luckily you can bye a replacement pen on here for like 25 bucks, which I did, so no biggie."
4240,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"I was skeptical at first purchasing a Refurbished phone online even more from a Vendor I never purchased from. I very much needed a new phone, so I read the reviews about this Vendor (Refoned), they seem to have great reviews, so I went ahead and purchased a phone which is the Samsung Note 10+ to be exact.Can I say... the Phone came two days early, looks brand spanking new and no scratches, I switched my service with no problems everything works perfectly well only thing was I could not get my text messages back because my previous phone was an LG... But that's ok.I would definitely shop from here and recommend this Vendor (ReFoned) to others.I love my new phone...Thank you! :)"
4241,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,There wasnâ€™t nothing wrong with the phone phone was absolutely in perfect working condition.
4242,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"Everything on the device has been great, however, the pen doesn't work. It keeps saying unable to connect and no matter what I try it doesn't help. I will have to purchase a replacement pen because all I got was a generic pen and not the correct one."
4243,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,It is honestly amazing I didn't even notice that this was a used phone other than a non noticable scratch on the right hand side. The phone has been working amazingly well so far definitely worth the price!
4244,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"So I knew I was gambling by buying a renewed phone. However, I took the chance and went for the excellent condition option. Phone had one tiny little scuff on the bottom right corner where the S pen is. No big deal because I case my phones anyway. Otherwise this thing so far is outstanding. I have an app that will take the battery life of the device and calculate its health, it's called AcuBattery and after a full charge test from 5% battery to 100% battery it determined its health was at 94%.. my old phone was a Motorola one 5G ace that I had for over a year and it's battery is bigger at 5000mah vs the note 10+ at roughly 4100mah. However, my old phones health was determined over a week of charging and using and its at 89% according to acubattery so I would say the battery being one of the biggest issues I have had in the past with renewed phones, this one was solid and with Amazon's 90 day return policy I don't see me being disappointed if the numbers change and the actual health is much worse than expected however this phones battery isn't big and it'd great size and features can really kill it fast. Otherwise, Spen/256gb storage with micro SD slot/cameras/Android 11/12gb ram/amazing processor/ great size/beautiful screen... this phone is totally worth $300-320 renewed. Beyond worth it. I'll update this if anything goes wrong but so far, solid buy."
4245,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Good phone
4246,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"The phone itself is OK. I purchased it refurbished from OlympicWireless is the only issue I have.  The phone came looking great in appearance. However,  multiple issues, the greatest is the fact that even though the phone was released in December and I received it on 8/24 the battery is GREATLY degraded. I get about 4.5-5 hours of normal use for me, watching YouTube and playing on Facebook. If I decide to play a game or something you can easily take an hour to 1.5 from the total above.  Also the screen quality,  I came from a 6yo Note 4 and my wife and daughter both recently picked up a S10 lite and A71 ALL 3 have MUCH BETTER image quality, yes including the Note4. My screen is fuzzy, like slightly out of focus and I'm not having the extremely vivid experience that pushed me towards this phone.  Side by side with the A71 it's almost comical knowing how much less expensive the A71 was yet has a far superior image. Yes my settings are maxed and I've tried mixing them,  lower resolution or vivid to natural etc. And lastly, the MOST GLARING proof the seller WOULD knowingly pass an inferior example on to the customer. All I received in the box was a aftermarket power brick and charge cord.  The brick COMPLETELY FAILED before completing the very FIRST CHARGE! The cord lasted about 3 days before starting in with the charge, stop charge, charge, stop and I'm taking every few seconds. Coming off the replaceable battery Note4 I VERY WELL KNOW the process to go thru to get the best out of a new battery. So I did the same with the phone. When I first booted the phone it had 57% charge,  I used the phone until it completely depleted the battery and powered off before charging. And when I powered the phone back on, the power brick from OlympicWireless had given up at only 26% charge! This IS A FLAGSHIP DEVICE,  yes a 10 month old flagship, (yes can be huge these days with how devices are changing) but the seller should realize people buying a device like this are serious users and want the best. The components sent with this phone are anything but. I'm still very tempted to return for the reasons above but I had to get a nano sim to replace the micro in the 4 and have gone thru the trouble of swapping what I had on that old phone. Was tempted to exchange it for note 20 ultra but prefer the less obtrusive camera on the back of the 10 plus so here I am,  slightly fuzzy screen, seemingly damaged battery with no way of charging it in the manner the phone was DESIGNED to be charged.  So BUY a refurbished note 10 plus,  it's a great device, just AVOID OlympicWireless. Found a GREAT SELLER here AFTER ordering this, forgot the name unfortunately but I suggest you keep searching past OW for a more positive experience and so you don't receive a BARE phone no factory installed screen protection or means of charging it AT ALL.ENJOY YOUR NEW DEVICE!"
4247,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"Got this a lot faster than expected, phone works great"
4248,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"Battery is good 100% charge, fingerprint reader is working very well, the phone works great I haven't encounter a problem at all."
4249,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,El artÃ­culo llegÃ³ mejor de lo que esperaba
4250,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Not sure if I got lucky or all refurbs are this good. It came looking brand new. Worked great of the box. I have had it for over 6 months and its been great. No issues so far. I dropped it on the bathroom floor so hard the pen came out. But it did not have any damage when I picked it up and all I have is a simple tpu case. So this thing must be strong.
4251,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,I got tired of paying monthly on my phone and decided to buy outright. I chose refurbished for the price and for environmental reasons. I will never buy from a phone carrier again!!! This phone has been amazing and iv had it for going on 2 years with no issues. Its not the newest model but it that doesn't bother me. I would highly recommend going this route to not only save money but to keep them out of landfills.
4252,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"IMPECABLE , FUNCIONA COMO SI FUERA NUEVO , PARECE NUEVO, LA UNICA DIFERENCIA QUE TU NO FUISTE EL PRIMERO EN USARLO , PERO PAGASTE MENOS DE  TRES O MAS VECES SU VALOR , ESO ES SUFICIENTE .LOS RECOMIENDO"
4253,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"This phone was available in excellent, good and acceptable condition. I went with the acceptable condition and there were only a few very small scuffs around the edges."
4254,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,This is my first time purchasing refurbished products. You can't even tell the difference but my pocket book can. With the extra money I was able to purchase a refurbished surround sound. I suggest giving it a try. You won't regret it and it's good for the environment.
4255,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"Came in early, looked great, sounded great. Very similar to the note 10 plus aura I previously had. Only one semi big issue. Backing of the phone by the power and volume side was not properly sealed correctly and was opening on first visual inspection. Battery life seemed solid and same as before and don't see a bulge so just taking it as a bad back glass replacement. If issues do arise will return but at the moment let's see if it's even noticeable in a case. If not then no worries. 3.8 out of 5"
4256,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"The Note 10+ I purchased from ReFoned was absolutely pristine - it looks and operates like a brand new phone. The included charging brick was pretty cheap e-waste, but I expected that going in. I'd almost prefer no brick, but it's fine. This phone is a vastly superior option to any midranger out there at a similar price. I see little practical difference between 4G LTE and 5G speeds, that may change in the future, but even then the typical 4G 40-60 mbps is just fine."
4257,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Phone came pretty much perfect.  Screen didn't have any scratches. Neither did the backside.  Only knick was near the USB c port but not even noticeable.  S pen works great.  Battery life is amazing.  Only charge it wireless while driving to work.  Very happy with this purchase.  Upgraded from a pixel 3. Had to charge that 3 times a day.  Now I don't even plug my phone in. Crazy.
4258,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Refurbished (good condition).Came in excellent condition and works great. Only flaw I found was on the S pen it looks like someone had chewed on it.
4259,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Not a single scratch on it. Was supplied with a a QC3 charger and no name cable. The cable was a little short but functions normally.
4260,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,I purchased the excellent condition.1. zero scratches2. Clean3. Quick shipmentIt's everything what I needed (like new)
4261,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"Buy from Re-Cell...I saw alot of reviews on here about sketchy shipping and cracked phones so I was a nervous wreck.  Got my refurbed phone a day early and it was packaged beautifully.  Phone had zero marks on it not even a hair scratch.  Huge Kudos Re-Cell, thanks for being so cool!The phone?  Let me just say that you can make it completely perfect by getting into the expansive settings menu.  If you are used to a different Android (me was LG) you can customize the three home buttons on the bottom.  If you put a tempered glass screen protector on there like I did they have a setting to adjust the screen sensitivity to compensate for that.  The side power button can be programmed to open any app on a double press, or open up your camera.Way to kill it Samsung!  Let's be honest, the S-Pen and size are really why you are here even looking at this review.  The screen is big and beautiful and bleeds over the rounded edges.  Those edges make this phone so easy to hang onto.  You can tell the phone to automatically open a certain app as soon as you pop out the pen.  If you are an artist the S-Pen has real sensitivity.  I was using the paintbrush and it actually reacted like real paint.  If I left the pen on the page the ""paper"" would absorb more ink....very cool.  I marked it down for battery life because although it will get you through a workday of normal use it will more than likely land you at home on 25%.  I imagine streaming and heavy usage may require a midday charge.  The fingerprint sensor worked good but not with a protective tempered screen even though the screen I purchased was specially made for the sensor.  Even with the extra sensitivity setting on I still had to press way too firmly for it to register my thumb and unlock my phone every time.  Again not really a flaw with the phone but something I wanted to share since everyone is (should) put a glass screen protector on here.  I finally just put it on swipe because I don't really have a reason to ever lock my phone.  Facial recognition may be a better choice if you have the protector on there as I would imagine pressing that firmly on your phone every day would eventually damage some pixels.  It is amazing device and it continues to blow my mind.  If you are on the fence, GET IT!  For some reason the black one is way cheaper.  It looks way better in person because it constantly is reflecting the blue sky outside so it gives it this amazing raven feather effect...only way I can think to describe it (Nevermore...will I have an ugly phone). I'm head over heels with this thing!"
4262,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Siempre lo comprÃ³ asÃ­ ya que la liberaciÃ³n mundial me favorece

4264,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"When my Moto Z4 discontinued support, I was in the market for a phone running Android 11 with potential for further support. I absolutely love my Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 tablet, and in using it, have become a regular S-pen user. Also, many years ago I had owned one of the early Note phones, and so the combination of those factors made me take a serious look at the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ 5G. I have had the phone for a month now (purchased from CPRTX, who has an 88% approval rating), and so felt it was time to share why I am extremely satisfied with this phone.The phone arrived earlier than promised, and had absolutely no marks of any kind on it. Without a case, it really is slippery--within 2 days I discovered that it truly was waterproof as it slipped into our hot tub. I obtained a thin, clear case (the back is too beautiful to hide), and all has been well.Although I have a Samsung tablet, it has taken a while to get used to the Samsung features of One UI 3.1, but I am adjusting and have even gravitated away from some Google apps to its Samsung app counterpart. The phone is lightning fast, the screen is clear and crisp (even though it's only 60 Hz), and the S-pen helps me to do work on the fly. Running Android 11 and supporting wireless charging has helped me use Android Auto wirelessly and use the wireless charger in my car. As others have noted, the included charger is actually a Samsung travel charger which was fine, but I purchased a 45W charger, and it is lightning fast!The camera is excellent, although I am not a heavy picture taker. However, the quality of scenic outdoor shots, such as sunrises and sunsets, is far better than pictures taken by my Z4 camera.With 4300 mAh battery, 6.8"" screen (still easy to hold and doesn't feel too big), 256 GB storage with SD card slot, and 12 GB RAM, the specs on this phone are still relevant which is amazing for a 2-year old phone. I have watched several videos of Note 10+ owners who feel strongly that this phone is still one of the best phones available today. I strongly agree!I would definitely purchase again and recommend this seller to anyone in the market."
4265,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"There's a lot of people that say refurbushed electronics are bad, but this phone has been a wonder since I got it. I got it for a very good price and it came almost as new.Been working for 5 months now. It was a great Amazon deal."
4266,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Need to download  the keyboard  with choosing  emogie and no gif option
4267,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"Like this phone very much,  it's excellent in condition!"
4268,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,I bought  two  because I never had any issues  with this cell note 10 plusGreat cell .I recommend  it.
4269,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"I took a considerate amount of time choosing to get this phone and I knew i couldn't afford the new full price so i trusted amazon with their 90 day money back guarantee for renewed products and i am so happy i did. The phone is beautiful and powerful! I have had the phone for almost a month and I know this phone is going to future proof me for a very long time and I absolutely recommend the device.The only hard part about getting this phone renewed is choosing which seller to buy it from. I bought mine through Electronic Deals and this phone came fast and practically new. There were no scratches on either side but there was a little dent on the bottom corner but it is soo little and with a case its non existent.PRO's:- $649 vs the full price (crazy amazing and the price fluctuates a lot so i waited for a day and then it dropped down)- NFC (samsung pay - love)- on screen fingerprint unlock is just awesome it does sometimes hiccup though but the technology is amazing.- Camera is just wow. (my samsung s7 took the pics of the phone and anything other was with the note 10+)- you can disable bixby- S-Pen is awesome! you can press the button to take pictures.- FAST and handles everything I throw at it- the screen ratio and quality beats every phone imo- the speakers are crispy (speakers are at the bottom and top)- the tiny hole disappears in my eyes and its worth to get the bezel-less displayCons:- tiny *very* tiny dent- I wasn't expecting the backside being so blue (still pretty) but for some reason i thought itd be silver. (see pics)- didn't come with Samsung charger just a random one (I still haven't used it) but i knew that already.- packaging freaked me out but it was protected enough- Lastly, sadly the waiting game to see if the phone in its renewed condition was okay w/o scratches (this had me anxious but know your protected by amazons guarantee and I recommend the seller Electron Deals)If you're on a budget and your okay with renewed then I recommend to buy it and even if your okay buying the new full price buy it renewed and use the rest of the money on something else. Its crazy to me that this phone is practically new and affordable so don't hesitate - its worth it. I bought my dream phone and I hope you can too!"
4270,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"Was delivered earlier than expected. Phone looks almost new, no noticeable scratches or dents. I'm downgrading from a 5G phone (Samsung A71 5G) but I can hardly notice the difference in speed because I use Wi-Fi most of the time. I'm satisfied with my purchase."
4271,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"I really like the Galaxy Note series. I hade a Note 8 before, and this Note 10 Plus is great! I am very satisfied with Amazon renewed. In fact, it is probably more impressive then companies like Swappa. I received my another 10 Plus and it had a problem. Bummer! The wireless functions didn't work. That is, wireless charging and wireless power share. I asked for an exchange, and the company sent out a replacement right away. I was able to copy all the data from the previous Note 10 Plus, to the new one, without any problem. The battery life on the Note 10 Plus is great. I can get about 6 hours of on screen usage time in one day, and the battery will last until I go to bed around 12. If you are looking for excellent phones that are used, Amazon renewed is a great option. They offer 3 months return no matter what is wrong with the phone. And as I stated before, when I received the replacement I was able to copy all the information to the new phone. So easy!"
4272,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"UPDATE - If you think SPen does not work make sure you stick it in the hole at the bottom and charge it ! I'm an idiot. At first I thought SPen did not work. It works fine.I am puzzled about the negative reviews  here. I got my Samsung Note 10+ from Amazon  Renewed via Re-Cell and I couldn't  be happier. The phone  looks brand new, as in unused. There were 2 small mishaps  which a quick call to Re-Cell fixed. The first is that I didn't  get an Spen, and they were very apologetic about that, they shipped  it immediately.  The second  was that the phone  had a screen  protector which had an air bubble. I don't like screen  protectors  so I simply  popped  it off. They offered to send me a return box (shipping  label for free shipping) and resend  me a phone  without  a screen  protector  though. I spent the first day setting  up my phone  (unlocked but I use T-mobile) and everything  was smooth. As a rule I never  hop on the new tech bandwagon  (5G) the first year  out. There's not much difference  between the 2021 Note20 and the 2020 Note10 but for 5G. For now the difference  between  4G and 5G is not perceptible  by users who are not streaming gamers and I would  argue that even heavy streaming gamers won't see much improvement.  5G for the next few years  is nothing  but HYPE . If my luck with this refurbished  phone continues  I will once again go with refurbished  for the 5G version  next year.  I don't  mind being  ""one year  behind"" with my smartphone and I refuse to sign long term  contracts.  Another  advantage of this approach  is that you get all the fixes and software  updates when you buy last year's model. Brand new models are always  full of bugs. Face recognition  and fingerprint security  work great! I have  been a Google pixel loyalist  so far and I have  to day Samsung  Note 10 UI is far better than Pixel."
4273,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"The value is decent , lots of storage , big screen.S-pen didn't connect at all do it was just a fancy stylus.Pretty Large scuff on the outer corner where the s-pen is probably not worth the hassle to return it for a new one.The price was good so I'd probably buy again.Wasn't expecting a perfect phone buying from renewed so it was good enough."
4274,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Phone is excellent however the battery seems to run down a bit faster than normal.  I am still monitoring. A good buy nevertheless.
4275,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I got this phone for my aunt that lives out of the country and she loves it. It really gives value for money and she really likes that itâ€™s dual sim and doesnâ€™t compromise on features such as fingerprint reading and facial recognition
4276,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Bought this phone for my grandma in Jamaica and she loves it especially that itâ€™s light weight. The only downside is that it doesnâ€™t come with the wall outlet to charge. So make sure you buy the wall outlet adapter. Overall she loves it. And itâ€™s easy for her to manage at 80.
4277,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Sound quality not so great!
4278,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"This is a good phone. The cameras are great, the storage space is great, and it has good battery life. It does take longer to charge than most phones, but I got used to it pretty quickly. I like that it's a popular model so there are a lot of different cases to choose from. If you are buying this phone in the US, I would order a wall plug if you use one because the phone came with a UK wall plug. Overall, I recommend this phone as an affordable option."
4279,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Very great product for the value
4280,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I purchased this device with the intent to use it on T-Mobile, after a Samsung representative assured me that it works on T-Mobile.Unfortunately, it appears that the A12 has very limited data bands, and as such, there is extremely spotty data coverage. This is very annoying and I will be returning this device.Make sure you do your research! This has potential to be an amazing phone in your region, but it will not be good for me in my region."
4281,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,The phone is decent for the price. It isn't perfect but it isn't bad. The camera isn't so great indoors or in low light. No issues other than lag here and there and calls cut every 1 and a half hours.
4282,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I installed my Sim card for tracphone however Every time I want to call out I have to put it in airplane mode turn off after 20 seconds and then I can place a call. This happens all the time. Called tracphone and they cannot figure my problem out? I can receive calls but not call out. Frustrated
4283,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Great phone for device consolidation.  Worked with Mint Mobile and T-Mobile Business right from the swap.  About the rest... amazing cameras, 4 GB memory, 128 GB storage and up to 1 TB card (swapped in a Kingston 512 GB microSDXC U3 for ""plenty"" extra storage) ...all, well, Samsung quality. Not brand-oriented at all, I had tried other phones and this one is exceptional in quality, dimensions and weight, being just about 35 grams heavier and 1/4 inch longer than a single-SIM Samsung Galaxy A20 --guess because of the beefier battery."
4284,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Recently, I bought this phone for my mom and she like it. I put this this overall rating, because this phone come with a travel adapter type G, it doesn't normal."
4285,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I needed dual sim phone for Philippines.  The phone works well in Philippines and I use both Globe and Smart sim cards.The phone lacks the smart view ability to screen cast.  It also is only 2.4g for internet connection.  It would have been nice to use 5g routers too.  Except for these two items I am very happy with the phone and camera.
4286,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,it works
4287,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,(SIM 1) No longer works on AT&T 3G (Band 5) (HSPA/UMTS/HSPA+) cell network as of 02/23/2022(SIM2) T-Mobile identifies as 4G (Band 41)(roaming band). I don't think this phone is true 4G-LTE. It to may stop working when T-Mobile shuts down there 3G service. I used Network Cell Info Lite and the paid version to identify the bands.Just seems dual SIM phones are NOT sold in the US market unless you want to spend $1000 plus USD.
4288,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,lose signal frequently
4289,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Phone came with charger but no headphones..overall it is a good phone
4290,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,gracias infinitas
4291,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I bought this product a new.But when delivered it was in a Ziplock bag with no product information, but because i was travelling the next day i had no choice but to take the loss"
4292,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Es un buen producto por el precio pagado.
4293,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,A gift item
4294,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Great phone for the Samsung name and the money value but just be careful that if anyone will use it in an LTE network which requires a Band 4, it wont work. It clearly says it in the seller description and it was my mistake that I didn't check our network provider available LTE Band."
4295,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I love this phone
4296,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Great
4297,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Ended up returning, phone worked but very slow."
4298,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Product arrived in perfect condition. Phone charges fast. Must unblock automatic downloads in phone settings before you can download anything from Google Play or anywhere else. That is the only known drawbavk of this device.
4299,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Found new in best buy for $50 cheaper...great phone but it's a scam. Had to find and remove a hidden system cleaner program & still having issues figuring out why it keeps disconnecting & saying emergency calls only. Just go buy it new in stores!!!
4300,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Phone works great in 4G. The camera is amazing!.It really was as expected
4301,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"All in all, a good purchase, but not terribly impressed w the sound quality as I'm always listening to online radio or podcasts and my previous phone sounds better (Motorola)."
4302,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I like but the price and the phone not much
4303,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,ITS A WONDERFUL PHONE IT REALLY WORKS WELL IN THE CARIBBEAN.
4304,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Did everything well and professionally

4306,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I bought it for my mom and she loves it! My mom is not a tech person at all, but this phone is easy to use."
4307,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Puede ser usado en Cuba, se conecta muy bien."
4308,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,To travel
4309,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I know it is a budget phone and I expected it to be slow. But I could not be able to use wifi on it. It could not list it even.
4310,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I bought 2 phones in late April to replace my 2 son's phones after the 3g/2g phase out. Everything worked really well, until one morning neither could connect to my providers network. They've spent the last week calling our provider trying to resolve it but everything on their end is fine, it's something wrong with the phone itself. We have even tried to replace the SIM card and now it doesn't even recognize the phone numbers on the card. No more calls, texts, or data on either phone. And because it's the international model Samsung said they couldn't help us. My best options so far to resell it range from $10 to $40, for a phone barely 2 months old. I'd give this a 0/5 if possible."
4311,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Exelente regalo para un familiar. Le gusto mucho.
4312,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,I had no problem with the phone.
4313,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"Iâ€™m very happy with this phone, I bought it for my niece and she loves it."
4314,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,No comments
4315,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Simply excellent product
4316,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,As expected
4317,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"I bought this to use it in my trip , it said that its international unlocked,  but the phone didnt not read the sim at all , i tried all sort local sims , gsm too.. nope... now it's a prop.. will return it when I get back to states."
4318,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,"This phone is literally the worst I've ever owned.  I hadn't owned it even two weeks when it fell off the bed onto a carpeted floor, and the screen had splintered despite a protective case and screen protector.  Its performance is irrelevant when being this delicate.  Now, it displays in monochrome, not color.  Biggest waste of money ever spent.  It leaves me wondering if it isn't actually remanufactured rather than new.  The screen is obviously plain, delicate glass."
4319,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,The phone came without a headset and the charger does not work.. not even the USB part when plugged into the computer
4320,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Samsung phone are good.Old faithful
4321,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Phone is brand new every fast shipping
4322,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Lo utilice para regalo
4323,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Worth every penny of it
4324,SAMSUNG,A12,4 GB,Android 10.0,6.5 Inches,Good value for the money.
4325,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"The phone itself looks and works great but just know that it may not be as unlocked as the listing implies. When I first put my VZW sim in.... Absolutely nothing. Phone said locked to ATT. After some furious googling for a couple hours trying everything I could possibly find I eventually discovered some settings that need changed and a code that had to be requested from the seller. After several hours and a huge pain it was eventually unlocked but this was not a process that would have been possible without a fairly significant amount of technical skills. I used to repair phones so this was something I could handle but if you just want something that is cheap and will work with no hassle this may not be a good option for you. That said, I do now enjoy this phone and got a fairly significant savings on it to buy refurbished like this."
4326,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"Years ago I had a Note3, I loved that phone,  and I'm so happy that the Notes have only gotten better!  I've had my Note 10 for about a month now and everything is awesome.  Great camera,  love the face recognition,  impressive battery life and I know there's so much more that I haven't even gotten to yet.  And then the AMAZING price of less than $300 for this incredible device!  Oh, and it is a stunning beautiful device.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase!"
4327,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"EDIT AUGUST 24, 2022: two years later and this phone is still going strong! Even when I use the phone throughout the day, it only needs to be charged every 24 hours. My phone case has kept it protected, it still looks brand new. Still runs like new. Even though this phone is ""renewed"" I've never had an issue that required it to be troubleshooted or repaired. If I ever replace the phone, I'm buying it renewed!Original review 2020:This is a product review, but first I wanna discuss my satisfaction with the fact that this is a renewed item.The phone arrived in a neat little box with generic brand charge cable and adapter, neither of these items are suited for the fast-charging capabilities of the phone, but I bought this item for the phone, so I'm not gonna knock them on a cord and adapter. The phone looked brand new, no scratches or damage of any kind, not even so much as a fingerprint on it.The phone powered up just fine and I was able to get it setup without a hitch, as far as I'm concerned they did an excellent job with the renewal, there's no way I can tell that it was even renewed except for the generic box, cable and charger. BTW, this product does not come with earbuds or anything, you only get the phone, the generic cord and generic adapter. Overall, I'm happy buying this renewed, saved myself 50% of the brand new price.As for reviewing the phone itself, this is my first Samsung phone, I've never so much as seen a Galaxy Note with my own eyes, and therefore I'm still learning things about it. But I can say I love the stereo speakers, it's great when playing music or gaming, the sound has a nice punch to it, better than any phone speakers I've ever heard. I was worried I wouldn't get used to the lack of a headphone jack, but I don't actually need it, I bought myself a nice pair of Bluetooth headphones, and I can't think of any other reason I would need the headphone jack.The screen is really nice, it's amazing how the fingerprint scanner is INSIDE the screen, makes for unlocking the phone quite easy and free of having to hold the phone awkwardly like with other phones. The hole punch for the camera in the screen is much less distracting than I thought it would be, and in the end, I hardly notice it. Since the fingerprint scanner is located inside the screen, you can't just get a traditional otterbox case for this phone, the heavy duty screen protector doesn't allow fingerprint scanning, so you have to buy a specific stick-on screen protector. As for the phone case, I bought myself a ArmadilloTek case, and I love it...I like having all the extra storage on the phone, in the past I always felt like my phone filled up with stuff too quickly. Also all my previous phones were prone to becoming slow after filling it up with apps, photos and music, but this phone...I've given it everything I have, only used up like 75 gigs, and have plenty more space, as well as the fast chip set in the phone makes the phone lightning fast.As for battery life, it lasts a long time! If you're just texting, listening to music, or periodically surfing the web, this phone lasts approximately 40-48 hours on a single charge.  If you're playing games and other power-consuming things, I believe this phone might get you through a pretty rigorous 24 hours.This phone came pre-loaded with a few useless apps, but didn't come pre-loaded with all the other useful apps that generally come on androids like a music player, Amazon, and other such...loaded it myself. I ended up loading Samsung Music...which I already love way more than iTunes or Apple Music.I'm still learning how to use the stylus pen, believe me, there is a TON of ways to use the pen, but from what I've tried so far, it's great! I especially like being able to hand-write notes and convert them to text. I wish I could say more about the phone, but again, I'm still learning. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase, it was well worth the money, I highly recommend it!"
4328,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"I have just recently put this phone down to try the Not 10. I miss it already!!! Although I have absolutely loved this phone, due to its weight & size my hands can no longer use it. I have used it a long while & I am afraid that it may be what has caused my hands to become so crippled up. I have very small hands & this phone absolutely is NOT friendly for ppl with small hands!!! I did use it ALOT!! I miss it too...I miss the headphone jack, the SD card slot, the power button...ALOT!! It has been the best phone I'd ever had even though it has caused me pain! Its now a Long Lost Love that I miss everyday but my hands are thankful for the smaller, much lighter Note 10. I also like how fast it is but my Note 9...I'll never part with!!"
4329,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,Won't hold chg. Past 8 hrs. Waiting on ideas from vendor. Didn't notice right away but now I have to run around with a charger all the time. Super frustrating after adding all my personal info. On the phone.
4330,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"It charges fast if you have a powerful cord. I like the blue stylus (blue is my favorite color).I bought a refurbished Note10 and it has screen sensitivity issues around the biometric area near the bottom of the screen, but I don't think this is a problem with all models."
4331,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"Face recognition and fingerprint wasn't used due to it being for my daughter (6) and I require full access to it as she is so young. I got it for snapchat to video call and send pics while I'm at work, that works decent. The phone (galaxy note 10) runs a bit slow but that's expected for the age. Worth the purchase without a doubt. Only 4 stars because the package wasn't very safe unlike it is directly from Samsung or a carrier. The screen also shattered after one drop but I believe that was her fault and not the company, worth the mention. I will buy from the company again if I am in need of a phone and I trust this company."
4332,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,I got the unlocked galaxy note 10 and it's wonderful and way cheaper than buying a new phone. I highly reccomend this. It was unlocked and I had no issues when I took it to Verizon. Very happy with this purchase.
4333,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,I was  kinda iffy about getting  anote 10 because  it  not made anymore but I glade I did I love it from the stylish  to the color  and there is so much it does
4334,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"Just received my note 10 today. The box contains the phone, Samsung charger, and pen. The phone was in prestine condition. No scratches and no dents. Since my older phone was a Samsung, I was able to use Smart Switch app to tranfer all my files and apps to the note. I took the cricket sim card from the older phone and inserted it to the note. As far as calls and texts, the phone works perfectly. The pen works also. What i have noticed, that with wire and wireless charging, the phone heat up. The fingerprint sensor is located on the front of the phone. It does what it suppose to do. I would have to get back with you about the battery and beleive me I will.  Looking at what I need from a phone in today digital world, this phone suits my needs. I could not afford this phone when it first came out. I had a Samsung 8 and was happy with it. It got damaged. Once again, do to lack of funds, l brought an A11. That phone was less than 200 and it let me know that. You pay for what you get. Samsung charges up to a 75 to 100 dollars for a note 10 renewed phone. So the money value is worth it. I have 90 days to critique this phone. If anything goes wrong, I will be back.Part 2, April 23, I have had the phone for two months. I had a problem with the sound quality. That turned out to be an app that I put on the phone. Do not put any sound enhanced app on this phone. There is no need for it. When this first happen, I contacted the seller with an email. As of today, I have not received any response from them. After contacting Samsung, the issue was resolved. As far as the amount of time your phone last on a charge depends on several factors. How much time you use your phone during the day. What are you using to charge the phone with. Base on my usage, a full charge will last a day. The fastest way is with a Samsung plug in the wall. It works faster than what came  in the package with this phone. I also have two anker wireless chargers. One is a stand. The other is a flat round one. The stand is good for overnight charging cause it the slower of the two.  The quickest way is to power down the phone and plug it into the wall with a 15w to 25w Samsung charger. 30 to 45 minutes, depending on battery level at the time you plug it  For you video needs. This phone has a 60hz refresh rate. The rate can't be changed like on the Note 10+. Also the screen is 1080p only. I haven't played with the camera yet. I will give it an eight for visual quality. They should have done at least HD. The 8 had HD and 4k video recording on it. For right now it serves my phone needs. I been wanting one for the last two years. I feel that this phone fulfill the basic digital features for a person today. Especially with the application of S pen capabilities."
4335,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,The stylus pen is all chewed up like someome had bitten up woukd like a replacement for this pen.
4336,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,The phone is perfect and runs great. It came a day early too. I have no complaints what so ever. I will be buying another on in the very near future.
4337,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,My daughter loves her new phone! Everything about the phone is just amazing. No disappointments. Thanks.
4338,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"So far it has been easy to set up I have metro and haven't had any problems phone looked flawless though it was moving around freely in the box so don't shake it too much, but once I was fully setup I can still see the same notification popping up for the s pen ive done youtube searches reset the pen taken it out and troubleshoot put it back in and trouble shoot what ive got outta it so far is I'm going to need to buy a new s pen that actually connects. I can take it out and scroll on the screen but that's it, not top happy about that it's one of the main reasons I got the note 10"
4339,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,Just wish it didn't have a chip out of screen since I paid for the the better one that was supposed to have a flawless display
4340,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"Samsung Galaxy Note 10, by seller: AradSystemCR I was highly sceptical of the ""Renewed"" deal, but I need to save some money! I had never bought a phone sight unseen, certainly not in a degree of used and most defiantly not in this price range, but I am so glad I did!  The Note 10, looks brand new!! I'm sure it is!!  It came in the original box, covered with a Samsung screen protector, in the soft little bag. All of the factory accessories seem to be included: Samsung fast charger, usb-c cable, (Not usb-C, Samsung, headphone/earbuds) and the key needed to remove/install the sim-card. The S-Pen was in it's compartment on the phone.  The battery had a 50% charge. With previous Galaxy phones I seem to recall an instruction manual in the box? Perhaps they stopped doing that? Nevertheless the manual was simple to find on the Internet.  There was a typed written note included, stating; that the phone had been tested on AT&T and/or T Mobile and that please address any issues or concerns to the seller: AradSystemCR. Activation: When I first started the Note 10, before inserting the sim-card, it had a Verizon Wireless, splash screen. I'm on Verizon, so I was hoping it would go easy - and it did!!  After connecting to my WiFi network, I let the phone charge completely, while I played a little with it a little, then turned off.  I moved the sim-card to this; new Note 10, and turned the phone back on. Just as it started I received a text from a friend, I made a before I could reply to the text I received a phone call. Now I am really happy!! Migrating Data & Apps: I had read a recent review on the phone recommending Samsung Smart Switch. WOW, this worked flawlessly!!  I had one issue with data and apps installed on a MicroSD card, which, of course, this phone cannot use. So now I have a folder; _ExternalCard_ that I cannot delete because I do not want to risk loosing my health related data for the past two years. I manually dragged all of the photos & videos to the default location, via Windows file explorer. I deleted all of the music and re-synced the PC with my Note 10's music app. All and all, migration and activation took me an hour, which was so much better than anticipated!! I had to re-enter my gmail account and all app related passwords. Everything was in the exact location as my old Galaxy j7v, all of my paired devices were listed, but I had to connect them all once before using them. The Note 10, did not seem to have any additional apps - bloatwear installed. It had nothing from Verizon, AT&T or anyone else, and only the generic Samsung/Android apps. I did have to install an Android update and restart. I installed the Verizon app, from Google Play. My only Issues: I choose the free shipping, which took a week. I knew this going in, but perhaps I am just spoiled to Amazon Prime, next day shipping. lol Now I need to learn these awesome new features. The s-pen is Awesome! The Note 10 is so fast!! I strongly recommend the seller: AradSystemCR, my brother is searching his store now and I have 3 good friends whom will be before Christmas. Thank you AradSystemCR!! Thank you Amazon for connecting us!"
4341,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"Okay so, it seems like a lot of people don't really understand how Amazon product selling works and tend to give negative reviews and don't recognize that the sellers of products are all different but sit on the same listing so although you can buy from one which is the default lowest price usually there are other sellers selling the same thing that may not be locked or misrepresented products.Now that being said, the person I bought mine from provided accurate information and that product came in a secure box and was in excellent condition. Sad it didn't come with an original box oh, but it being renewed I can't hit the seller for that.On to the phone itself, it's a really good phone in general the specs are good 256gb at storage and the ram is 8GB and I've never seen it get anywhere near running all the way or even much over halfway of capacity. Now here comes the surprise there is no SD card slot so if you buy a regular note 10, there will not be the option to extend any storage. The other thing I don't much care for is the fingerprint reader. Although it is innovative I would much rather prefer a physical dedicated location that is not part of the screen because it makes it very difficult to use and if you have a screen protector you might as well just forget the option exists. Another thing is I don't really care for the way that Samsung has restricted the phones there's a lot of useless and unnecessary apps I can't get rid of and everything involving the Samsung and Google competition on the phone is relatively annoying and it makes it more confusing because I don't want 2 separate stores sending me notifications to update things and Samsung seems to have taken the ability to silence those notifications away from their Galaxy store. But those are just personal annoyances that aren't all that important other than the fingerprint reader and SD card slot which is relatively significant. I'm also not overly impressed with the battery. It seems that it's not as good as the 2017 Huawei Mate SE I replaced. Although the camera is EXTREMELY good in quality.Finally, for those of you interested in rooting, as you may know United States versions of Samsung phones tend to be restricted in the ability to be rooted by any simple method. I received a SM-N970U1 which seems to be a Verizon specific model. In the short answer is no for most people there will not be a free or simple way to root the phone. I did manage to accomplish reading it, but it cost 65 bucks and I had to locate someone who either does or has worked for Samsung who was able to generate a unlock script to remove the bootloader lock from the phone and it is now rooted. They have to generate a script for your specific device ID to remove the lock from the phone. Which can only be done up to a certain update point no higher than Samsung one UI 3.0 and no higher than a Android 11 5th bootloader update.I now have an unlocked rooted Verizon Samsung Note 10 on Verizon. And overall I'm happy with it but in general I probably will not buy another Samsung phone with options like plus one and various other models that are just as good or in reality better. And generally cheaper. I would say I would prefer Huawei or Motorola over Samsung. I hope this has been helpful to Anyone who reads it."
4342,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,Everything works awesome. Exactly what I wanted

4344,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"Like phone, fingerprint works well just have hold finger down longer then I would like, battery life is great. Face recognition is ok could be better."
4345,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,The only blemish was a minute corner dent at the bottom edge on phone. No other issues phone issue. Battery life decent for a Samsung. Almost the Same size as my S9. No SD Microchip which makes no sense at all. Compatible with Cricket service which usess ATT coverage. I don't think it's 5G not sure if that's a phone or service provider deal. Pics are much better than my S9 which my S9 was worst than my S7. Screen clear and vibrant. My only issue is that it keeps dropping my wifi but that may be my issue. Overall a great purchase.
4346,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"I bought the phone because my husbands phone broke and the very same day I bought it, the sender sent out the phone and it came 2-3 days later. There was some some problem with the delivery service and I was very upset but the company was quickly to replied and help to try to fix. I am very pleased and will be ordering in the future with them. The phone came in a great condition. The only thing I would say is the battery life on the phone is fairly draining quickly but it is it."
4347,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,Muy bueno ğŸ‘Œ

Â I love it it works well I was able to switch my straight talk Sim card from my note 9 and place it in turn it off and on and works perfectly just make sure you purchase the fully unlocked one instead of all carriers if you are wanting to use it on your own phone company  overall great bye rear camera is good face cameras not as good but this was the next affordable phone with a good camera after my iPhone 13 promax"
4349,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,Battery issue. It gets heated and drains quickly
4350,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"Purchased this device over a year ago and just now getting around to writing a review.  Its working flawlessly , no issues at all;  Just like brand new.  Definitely recommend purchasing from this seller"
4351,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,I like having more storage than the 32g my old phone had and the better picture quality.  I don't like that I can't get my notification sounds to work or apps I use regularly to pin on my home screen.  I also like that the volume is loud enough. I can hear better than I could on my old phone.
4352,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,I love it
4353,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,I like everything about the phone and I recommend the seller.
4354,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"I liked that this phone had a decent sized screen, thought it would be bigger but that was a my bad. Love the pen. And no sd card space. So that's sad. But good purchase. Worth the price."
4355,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,Freezes a bit but functional for the most part
4356,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"This phone is AMAZING! It did have a few small dings but it's refurbished. All in all this phone works perfectly, looks fantastic, and all I had to do was slip my Sim card in!"
4357,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,My phone never got wet but I have a moisture in the charging port error for 3 weeks now.
4358,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,Happy with purchase
4359,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"Charging port has actual dirt in it? Keeps the charger from going in all the way, otherwise it works fine."
4360,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"This phone is awesome, I love the stylus and all its quirks, one thing is the speakers on mine are kinda busted and sound pretty scratchy but it's not the worst as I always use headphones anyway. I draw a lot and this phone is perfect for it, I can draw my little heart out on this phone! I've never had a phone so young, it's only a year old and it's so new and interesting! My old phone was made in 2017 and the rest of my phones were bought by random people selling cheep phones. IVE NEVER HAD A PHONE WITH 3 CAMERAS AND IM NEVER GOING BACK! I look a million times better with this camera and I've never felt better in my body! I feel so confident and I'm so glad!"
4361,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"I will always purchase my phones, laptops, tablets from Amazon. They offer the best warranty and they take care of all problems."
4362,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"Battery doesn't last long, kind slow with my service provider. Will not allow me to view pictures that are sent to me."
4363,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,I love this phone.  It does everything that it's supposed to do.  I do recommend it.  The battery last all day for me and I only charge it to 85% to preserve the battery life.
4364,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,I HAPPY
4365,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"I'm in love with my phone, But the item come two day late, that's fine I'm still happy, Thank you very much âœ¨ğŸ’œ"
4366,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,It take excellent pictures.
4367,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"When I received the packaged, I was happy.I can say the note 10 is still worth buying."
4368,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,"This phone's okay. Battery life is getting shorter after only 4 months use. The camera seemed really good when I first bought it, but now that seems like the quality has gone down even after updating and cleaning properly. What I REALLY don't like about this phone is the S pen. It's so flimsy lost it in my blanket once and the thing snapped in half. Cost me $45 to order a new one which is a ridiculous price for a flimsy piece of bamboo. I bought this phone as an upgrade from my samsung 9 and as far as I can tell other than the rainbow design nothings really improved.  This phone also doesn't have an headphone port which is just aweful when you you think about the money you spent on it. Even my cheap Samsung 9 had a place to plug in headphones.  One last thing, I don't like the new picture gallery program. The old one had a create your own filter option that I really liked and now it's gone. ğŸ™"
4369,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,Awesome phone at a great price. This phone works perfectly. Exactly as described I am very happy with this purchase. The only thing wrong was the generic charger that came with it didn't work at all and I've tried using it with all my old devices but its not a big deal the phone and cable works perfectly using my old charging brick.
4370,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,It's really good
4371,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,Don't use these features!
4372,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,The Note 10 looks great! It has a minor scratch on the metal bezel. Not an issue for me. I've looked at a hundred phones for the same price. A lot of them came close. The Note 10 was the only one at this price range that has it all! It's a Flag Ship Phone at Damn good price! I am very satisfied.
4373,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,Bought this for my son. It's a huge upgrade from his old phone. He loves it. No issues. Great value.
4374,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 10,256 GB,Android,6.3 Inches,Este galaxy note 10 ... esta trabajando super... me encanta
4375,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Lo tengo en mis manos desde el 11-10-2022; y hoy 11-11-2022 hago mi reseÃ±a para compartir mi experiencia.Aunque es la primera vez que compro un telÃ©fono con 8GB de RAM, puedo decir que estoy muy complacido con mi compra, ya que mi anterior telÃ©fono tenÃ­a 3GB.En cuanto al espacio de 128GB, me siento bastante bien y conforme, ya que antes tenÃ­a que estar eliminando Apps, Fotos y Videos para tener mÃ¡s espacio disponible.Algo que deseaba tener de un telÃ©fono es el puerto Tipo C, ya que es mucho mÃ¡s cÃ³modo y eficiente; y por suerte, ya lo van a estandarizar, por lo que todos los telÃ©fonos del mundo que salgan a partir de ahÃ­ lo tendrÃ¡n.El tamaÃ±o de la pantalla es excelente, ya que, hace mucho que querÃ­a tener un telÃ©fono con una pantalla de mÃ¡s de 6 pulgadas, ya que asÃ­ todo se ve mucho mejor y ayuda a no forzar tanto la vista.Me encanta la idea de que mantenga las actualizaciones al dÃ­a, asÃ­ podrÃ© sentirme un poco mÃ¡s seguro, ademÃ¡s de la optimizaciÃ³n del equipo, que siempre viene incluida.La cÃ¡mara de 48 MegapÃ­xeles y el excelente Zoom me tienen complacido; solo que a veces pone las fotos como con ambientes que hacen que no tengan la suficiente nitidez y calidad, pero he notado que lo hace cuando el clima exterior no estÃ¡ normal y soleado. La cÃ¡mara frontal tambiÃ©n estÃ¡ muy bien.Ahora puedo jugar mis juegos favoritos con total libertad y movilidad; aunque, hay algunos que siempre exigen mÃ¡s, por lo que, en Ã©se caso, solo me adapto.Se siente bastante bien al agarrarlo, ya que es liviano, suave y fino; y aunque el protector es fino y delicado, le puse un PopSocket para poder agarrarlo con mayor comodidad, ya que se me hace difÃ­cil usar un telÃ©fono sin Ã©se accesorio.Me gusta la idea de que tenga el cristal Gorilla Glass 4; que aunque tengo otros protectores para el telÃ©fono y la pantalla en mi carro de Amazon, me siento un poco confiado de que si se me cae, no se me daÃ±arÃ¡ la pantalla muy fÃ¡cil; ademÃ¡s, me siento tranquilo al poder poner llaves en el bolsillo junto a Ã©l, ya que antes tenÃ­a que tener cuidado y usar un bolsillo exclusivo para el telÃ©fono, para evitar rayones en la pantalla.TambiÃ©n me he adaptado a la nueva forma de usar el telÃ©fono sin botones en la parte de abajo; ya que al tener la opciÃ³n de ""ir atrÃ¡s"" con solo deslizar hacia la izquierda o la derecha en los bordes, es mucho mÃ¡s cÃ³modo, fÃ¡cil y eficiente.Otra opciÃ³n que me encanta muchÃ­simo es la de la ""llave inteligente"", que es el botÃ³n del lado izquierdo, ya que ahÃ­ configurÃ© las capturas de pantalla con un solo toque, ya que hago capturas a cada rato sobre los juegos que voy jugando, entre otras cosas; y la linterna la puse con 2 clics porque al ponerla con 1 se puede activar al meterse el telÃ©fono en el bolsillo o al ser tocado sin interÃ©s de encenderla.Tiene muy buen sonido y se siente bien al escuchar lo que voy viendo y sin problemas de calidad.El sensor de huellas digitales estÃ¡ alucinante, ya que tiene una sensibilidad muy buena.Sin embargo, no uso protecciÃ³n con huella digital por Seguridad, ya que, un PolicÃ­a mal intencionado o un delincuente, pueden obligarte por la fuerza a poner tu dedo o dedos para abrir tu telÃ©fono y robarte dinero o informaciÃ³n que no tienes interÃ©s en compartir; por eso solo uso un patrÃ³n, ya que, aunque alguien intente ver de lejos, es mÃ¡s difÃ­cil seguir la ruta de tus dedos; pero no serÃ­a igual si pones un PIN.Hasta ahora lo Ãºnico que no me ha funcionado de las opciones internas es la del NFC, ya que solo aparece la opciÃ³n de configuraciÃ³n avanzada (en inglÃ©s), pero al tocarla no lleva a ningÃºn sitio; y cuando abro alguna App que permite pagos sin contacto, al buscar la tecnologÃ­a en el telÃ©fono y no encontrarla, se sale.En fin, estoy satisfecho con el telÃ©fono; y con relaciÃ³n al tema de los pagos NFC, deberÃ­an resolver eso con tiempo, ya que hoy en dÃ­a eso es muy necesario e importante y deberÃ­a de estar funcionando con normalidad; aunque, espero que corrijan el error en alguna actualizaciÃ³n.Sin dudas mi compra de otro telÃ©fono mÃ¡s adelante serÃ¡ de la Marca Umidigi, ya que ofrecen dispositivos de alta calidad con garantÃ­a, a muy bajo costo.Gracias por tu tiempo.Gracia y Paz."
4376,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The Umidigi F3 is the perfect mid-range mobile phone for the user who wants a balance of performance and price. This phone has a premium features, more-than-acceptable camera, excellent battery life, and speedy processor.Premium Features: The F3 includes features that you would find in pricier phones.  You can unlock the phone via the front camera or the side button fingerprint reader.  I happen to prefer using the side button over the screen reader on most other phones because of convenience.  The F3 also includes an FM radio receiver built in.  How cool is that!?!  Another capability that you no longer find in most phones is a headset jack.  You have the option to use both wired and wireless headsets.  Although the screen is only 1650 x 720, everything is bright and clear.  Playing non-graphics intensive games has been great with no motion issues.Camera: The F3 triple rear cameras and single front camera are more than acceptable for the regular user.  Selfies turn out sharp and clear and photos with the rear photos have clarity that match more expensive phones like the Samsung S21 (I couldn't believe it either...and my significant other is quite ticked off on how much she spent on her S21...LOL).Battery: The F3 has a 5150 mAh battery, which surpasses almost every other phone out there.  I can easily wait 2 days before having to recharge the phone.  Only negative is that there is no wireless charging.Processor:  This is the biggest surprise for me with the F3.  The MediaTek Helio P70 was fast with no noticeable lagging when navigating apps, playing games, and editing documents.  Granted, the chip cannot handle graphics hogging games, but then, most phones can't either.In general, I would recommend the Umidigi F3 to anyone who wants a phone that provides higher value than the price would indicate.  This would also make a great second phone or one for your younger kids."
4377,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The specs seem good on paper, but it struggles when connected to my car with Google Auto. It's pretty good otherwise, most applications run with no perf issues.The location of the fingerprint reader (part of the on/off button) is uncomfortable - most times I hold it, one of my fingers is there, and the reader tries to decipher it even though I didn't want that.All in all, a mediocre phone that's somewhat disappointing compared to the older S3Pro. The only reason I replaced the S3 Pro is that Umidigi doesn't provide any updates for it, so it's stuck with Android 9."
4378,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Still learning about what all this phone can do but all in all I'm very happy with this purchase. Especially after agonizing for 2 weeks as to what phone to get. I'm glad I chose this
4379,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,First off had a heck of a time getting it to hook up to my wifi.  Kept telling me was connected but no internet. I still tried to open Chrome told me my date and time were wrong so couldn't do a hand off. Here the date was Nov 2004 and was set to somewhere in Mexico. Once corrected that seemed to fix it that!  my old Umidigi was 3 yrs old and the battery was dying. So far so good with getting on US Mobile was a breeze. Will try to update.
4380,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,It's okay.
4381,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The umidigi F3, another umidigi phone entering my household. This has been number 5? So I may be biased, but there's a reason I've identified so well with this brand. They produce quality inexpensive phones. The hardware you get for the price you spend is easily twice as much as other competitors.I know and trust umidigi, they update their software, they support their customers, and they make awesome tech. Trusting a company, especially one that most people haven't heard of, is such an awesome thing.I get a phone with a wonderful camera, good battery life, that's stylish, comes with a case and screen protector, all for less than what most garbage phones in the states ask for.Ask yourself do you actually want to keep buying phones that are overpriced or don't work? No of course not. Umidigis f3 phone works in there U.S they make actually global, global phones.All this on basically stock android too, no horrible software bloat like the major companies I've bought from add into their phones.Give umidigi a try, My house uses them, my uncle uses them, and my friends use them."
4382,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Mil veces mejor que un Samsun o Hawei
4383,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"This is a performance phone for $200. UMIDIGI is a go to phone if you want a cheap phone with high end specs. Well worth the price.. why?Pros:8GB Ram and 128 GB internal storage. Plenty for smooth operation and storageGreat Pictures from Sony Cameras.. my attached pics were taken with the phone. Crisp clear pictures!The short cut button is customizable and really helpful for frequent tasks and quick launch of appsThe humongous battery and fast charging together, they give you a peace of mind for days. Turn off the ""screen on when you pickup"" function from settings if you want to extend batter lifeGlobal 4G network compatibility without loss of speed and reliabilityAudio is loud and clearNo bloatware.. this is very important for meCons:Android 11 - will it ever get to 12?Not a 5G phoneThe finger print scanner is the power button.. it's really sensitive and I accidentally turned the phone off multiple times, while trying to setup fingerprint. I would've also preferred an in screen finger print scannerI'll continue to update this as I use the phone.. overall, I recommend this phone if you are looking for a cheap high performance phone."
4384,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"This phone is a perfect mid-ranger. I believe it's perfect for kids to adults that just want a reliable device that runs without lag. I have been using Umidigi devices for years now. They all still work without issues for all this time. I still use an Umidigi S3 Pro as my Pokefone. This is still a brand that provides a case, a screen protector, and a charger ! The battery lasts all day, the screen is nice and big, and the back looks great. It has a shortcut button that let's you choose whatever app you want to open with a single click. And then you can choose a different app for a double click. I usually pick the flashlight for that. And then a press and hold for a 3rd app. I love that if you choose to navigate with gestures, there is not hint bar like on Pixel devices, yo get a nice full screen. This phone has zero bloat. This phone has 8gb of ram so you won't have any slowdowns. And if you are Android tinkerer like myself, it is very easy to root this device. At this price point this is a no brainer."
4385,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"                    The media could not be loaded.
                



Â For 200 bucks ( + taxes if applicable). Umidigi F3 is a great phone for everyday use, with 8 GB memory and 128 Gigs of internal storage, there's no worry of running out of storage because of pics or apps.The battery capacity for Umidigi phones have been at the 5050mAh which gives more than a day of good usage easily too, I have another Umidigi Phone (s3 Pro) for 2+ yrs now which still gives a day plus of usage.Having used this phone for a couple of days now, and haven't experienced any lags or missed touch response.The UX has been kept close to stock and not a ton of default Apps come installed which is great!Easily able to connect to 4G LTE networks ( TMobile and AT&T). Camera quality is good for this price range. The customizable button comes in handy for frequent operations.It also comes with a charger/USB3 charging cable, a screen protector applied and a protector case!!The only thing that I think could have been better was if it came with Android 12, it runs Android 11, I hope that it gets Android 12 upgrade soon.Overall a great value!"
4386,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"If you are looking for ""bang for the buck,"" this is it.  First off, I have to say that I am a bit prejudiced. I've owned a Umidigi F1 Play for several years and it has been faultless.  When I saw this F3 at $161.49 I thought I would try it.  After receiving it I found its large screen, 6.7"", to be bright and exactly the size I wanted.  After starting it up the processor was blazing fast.  Another big plus is the reception.  I have found dead spots with my other phones in my area.  This one pulled in a signal where others could not.  I was disappointed in one area, transferring apps and data from my old phone.  I tried Bluetooth and NFC and I could not connect to my old Umidigi F1 Play.  It may have been me or there was a compatibility issue between the two phones.  What you get with this phone is a good camera, great performance, outstanding connectivity, and an unbeatable price."
4387,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The silver color looks so pretty. Features of camera are powerful and really useful, I like the extrawide angle mode. The screen is big and bright and crisp. Big battery, 8g of memory, 128g of storage, mainstream configuration, smooth operation, clear and bright sound, and importantly no annoying app built in ---- I don't like being forced to cram in a lot of junk. Also commendable is the gift of a beautiful transparent phone case.However, the adapter is always so big due to fast charging.  My power strip is overcrowded  :("
4388,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Iâ€™ve owned several union phones. The phones do not feel cheap or miss essential features. The new f3 actually is a great phone. Is better than the Samsung a series. The photos are quite good, the phone is zippy, the screen is bright and crisp. I am actually impressed. It paired with my watch and no problems with Wi-Fi or lagging in videos. Those phone is actually worth more then theyâ€™re charging. Iâ€™ve given cheaper phones to the kids and they actually prefer this phone and want me to buy one for their birthday."
4389,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Trying to reset access point name information hopefully it will be compatible with TracFone
4390,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Good display for being 720p, easy to hold with 20:6:9 aspect ratio. Beware description says stereo speakers but bottom firing speaker only."
4391,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I like the phone a lottttt, but the matte silver looks a lot darker than the one advertised in the pictures. I'll be returning it for a black one. My Qlink wireless sim card works good in this phone. Great size and price"
4392,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I must admit it is a very nice looking device.  However I'm not sure if it's a 4g or LTE phone. I tried to get it activated on 3 different service providers and neither could get the phone activated. But looked good,  camera seemed nice,  screen was clear but while using super fast xfinity internet it seemed a little slower than I expected."
4393,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Wow wow wow!!! This is a beautiful phone for a fraction of what phones usually cost. Brand new and packaged beautifully. It works like a charm and I am very proud to call this my phone. The more expensive brands are so overrated and they charge too much. This phone is worth it folks!
4394,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,The phone has a great finish and the battery life is insaneits easy to set up just put my sim in and its up and runningthe headphone jack is a plus

4397,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Make sure you read everything
4398,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Unboxed, set up wifi, transfer all stuff from my old phone, man I love this phone, up until I put my Sim in. The Mrs got a text from cell carrier that my number was deleted from the account, phone locked up no internet no text, no calls nothing. Att/cricket text said to immediately put my Sim in my old phone or reactivation fees will be incurred. Switch back Sim to old phone call them up they say its a 3g phone, I said no I made sure it was 4g, check imei numbers it's 3g.best of luck this is my 6th umidigi but the last 2 have been no goes because of being 3g but labeled 4g"
4399,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,The battery lasts all-day! Even with me using the phone the entire day it had 17% charge when I went to bad. I bluetooth music to my bedroom stereo and play it all night. Music was still playing when I woke. The phone works lightning âš¡ fast. The facial recognition is nice. Fingerprint is iffy. I have problems with fingerprint readers on every phone I have owned. The F1 seems to be getting better with the fingerprint reader as I use it more. Great phone for an excellent price.
4400,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"It says unlocked to all carriers but,it's wrong and false advertisement because,I took it to cricket and tried to get this phone on with a new sim card .and they said it's not compatible with cricket service so I'm having to send this phone back before I can even get my 200 back so I'm not very happy,and the seller needs put on here who it is and who it is not compatible with because,it's bull crap when you got unlock to all carriers when's it's not so if you have cricket do not buy this phone bc it won't work...."
4401,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"El equipo en general llegÃ³ en buenas condiciones, la pantalla tiene un pixel muerto pero en general el celular funciona bien"
4402,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Really great for the price, I've heard some iffy reviews of camera, but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. The tones are a tad warm, and you have to take the time to focus correctly in bokeh(portrait) mode, but all in all very satisfied. Quick and powerful. I'd buy it again."
4403,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Muy buen celular justo en cuanto a exigencias de organizaciÃ³n y procesacion de programas muy rÃ¡pido con muy buena baterÃ­a y a un excelente precio no le pide nada a los de gama alta
4404,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I love love love this UMIDIGI Smartphone. This is the perfect size. Response is very fast. The look is streamlined. The color, which is a dreamy color RED is not too bright , just right.  Kind of satin looking. The weight is perfect. I am so happy!!! Just get this exceptionally beautiful high end phone."
4405,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Good phone.. Value for money. Bought it for discount.
4406,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,This is not good at all.
4407,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Hasta aora todo funciona perfectamente
4408,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,The camera on this phone is crap. For 48 and 16 megapixal camera. It's cheaply made. And then to compare it with Samsung camera that's just lie and deceptive. Now the speaker not working. It's I rip off. Not worth the cost.  I wanted a phone because my phone stopped working but this is garbage
4409,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Update July 2020.After having the phone for a few weeks, a few dead pixels show up, in the middle of the screen, only noticeable in black backgrounds. They sent a new one with no problem, and I am in the process to returning the old one. The new one is working great so far, we had to go back to metropcs to activate the sim card in the new one, this time they charge us 25 dlls, we like this phone a lot, the battery is durable, the camera is great. I am planning to order another one for my self, this one is for my boyfriend, he works at construction so that is why the screen protector is already damage in the old phone, for normal use it will be fine for a while. I didn't find any good hard case protector in amazon, but I tried at the store the case for Moto G Stylus and it did fit the phone, the only problem are the buttons in the case, they don't match, but I don't mind, I am planning to make a hole or something, because I really need a good sturdy case before my boyfriend crack the phone.June-2020Arrive on time, despite the seller didn't gave any tracking information. The phone works great and the battery life is good, has 1 slot for 1 SIM only, and the 2nd slot is for a SIM or a SD card. Is working fine with metro-pcs, despite we had to go to different customer service places, because in the 1st one they just say that phone won't work with metropcs, they only switch the SIM from the old phone to the new one, of course that didn't work! american cell phones companies married the SIM with the imei, so the company has to do the process first. in the second place, the lady was really helpful and start the process immediately, took like 5 minutes and cost under 17 dlls. I also tried a mexican SIM from movistar and works really good, I didn't even had to add the configuration for APN, to have 4G, automatically did it, not like other unlock phones I had before. The camera is decent, and the apps run smoothly, comes with one screen protector installed and a simple black case, flexible."
4410,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Pones are nice however they donâ€™t work with tracfone.
4411,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Had the Play F1 for 17 months and very happy with the phone for the price. Easily the best battery life of any phone I have owned. Can get over 10 hours screen on time staying between 10 and 90 percent as do not charge to 100 or deplete under 10 to protect the battery. Call quality is good, speaker is loud enough, screen size and colors are great. Camera is just okay, when you really blow up images, the detail is not there. Although I'm comparing to a Pixel 2, so can't expect it. Performance is fine and never noticed any slow functions. I do not game, so no review on gaming.Phone has many bands and have used it in USA and all over Asia with multiple sims and works very well.  Dual sim feature is nice to have."
4412,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Great camera
4413,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I got this and it don't work.  It won't turn on.  They are sending me another one and ifnit don't work I am done with it.
4414,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Great great
4415,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Nothing bad to say except I wish the case that came with it was a hard case. The case is so flimsy. It won't stop it from being damaged if I drop it.
4416,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I love this phone comparing it to the a13 or a11 this phone is way better specs memory and all the specs are great not quite 90hz but the screen is cinimatic viewing beautiful you will enjoy paying games on this device and watching movies and the colors are beautiful love the camera hdr mode and just the detail all the specs you need. Giving this a 5 stars also seller is fast shipping got mine the next day. I really love this device. Good price too
4417,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I am happy with this phone, it is cheap but very nice and fast, the battery lasts a long time"
4418,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I usually wait a whole month after purchasing a phone to review but I've had this phone for only 4 days and I hate it!! When i saw all of these 5 star reviews i was very skeptical because this brand never gets more than 3 stars and now i see why! First, the sound is horrible, so low that whenever I watched a video or movie i had to bring the phone close to my face to be able to hear correctly! I always used closed caption because the sound is unbelievably low!! While watching videos the images often would become very pixilated. The front camera is terrible too! Also whenever a call comes in while im doing something on my phone, the caller ID isn't displayed and I'm unable to answer the call! There are a few other annoying things but those were the most bothersome for me and because of that I'm not keeping this phone and I'll never purchase this brand again!!"

4425,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"My wife, 3 children  and I all use iPhones and have various different models.  My parents use Android phones because they preferred Samsung phone over Apple iPhone.  They are now so used to using the Android phone, they don't want to switch over to iPhone but my dad recently dropped his Samsung phone on a hiking trip and his phone cracked opened and needed to get a new one so I got this as his replacement Android phone until his current AT&T contract ends for new promotional upgrade.  I told him to give it back to me once he gets a new phone later because I can use this as a backup phone incase one of my kids lose or break their phones but he actually loves this phone so much that he might just keep it permanently.  We all have AT&T family plan and this TCL 30 SE worked fine with AT&T service and should work with any other GSM carriers.I helped my dad replace the nano-sim card from old broken phone to this TCL 30 SE then set up his Android phone. I was so impressed with this phone, I played around with it to compared with my iPhone and how they are different from each other.WHAT I LIKE:[+] 6.5"" HD screen is really clear and crisp. The colors look beautiful on the screen.[+] The package comes with the screen protector AND a phone case!  I always had to buy screen protector and phone case separately for all our family's iPhones...[+] There are 3 cameras on the back and the main camera is 50MP while other 2 cameras are used for macro and field depth function.  Yes, 50 megapixels wow...[+] I love the biometric finger print reader on the back of the phone, perfectly placed for the index finger.  You can just hold the phone and touch the reader with your index finger to unlock and turn on the phone screen.  Very simple and hassle free.[+] It also has phone unlock feature with face recognition using front camera as well as PIN code.  Front camera is 9MP and is also very impressive in picture quality.[+] Comes loaded with the latest Android version, which is version 12.[+] I love that internal memory space can be increased with micro-SD card up to 512GB!  This is something you would never, ever see with Apple's iPhones... so jealous[+] The phone feel solid and sturdy when holding, while it's not too big like Apple iPhone Pro Max[+] Great battery life so you don't have to charge every day.[+] Fast and responsive screen and touch.[+] Price!  It's a fraction of the cost of iPhone or Samsung phones.WHAT I DON'T LIKE:[-] I'm so used to using iPhone so I'm very confused when using Android OS so this is not specific to this phone as Android OS is made by Google.  Same reason why my dad can't switch from Android to Apple since he's now so used to using Android OS.[-] It does not support 5G network but this is not a big deal for my dad who mostly uses his phone for calls and always uses WiFi at home.BOTTOM LINE:Easily 5 out of 5 stars.  I am very impressed with the camera and love taking pictures and video with this phone as I use my iPhone to take pictures of my kids all the time.  I still can't believe it has 50MP camera and pictures come out crisp and beautifully.  You rally can't go wrong with this Android phone for the price.  Highly recommend it to any Android phone users."

Â Got this budget phone to use as my secondary phone and also to put an international mobile sim in it. Didn't want to spend a fortune as my primary phone is one of the latest iPhones and hence decided to go for this after a friend's suggestion. Overall I am very satisfied with the phone for the features it offers at this price. Comes as a complete package including a case and a screen protector too. I would recommend this phone for this price and if you are fine with the cons mentioned below.Here is my take after owning this phone for a week:Pros:- This phone is compatible with all US carriers mentioned in the description. I tried it with a T-Mobile connection and it works great- It has a good microphone and the sound is clear overall during calls- Screen resolution is good (6.52"" HD+ display with 720x1600 resolution & 20:9 aspect ratio) and usable for most of the needs- Screen is bright and even usable outdoors in sunlight- It has a loudspeaker overall and does the job for most of the needs. Audio works great- Comes with 64GB ROM, however, around 30% of the storage is being used by the operating system itself. But, the SDcard slot lets you expand the storage by 512GB further- It is an android phone and hence supports all the apps that you can imagine (email, MP3, GPRS, FM radio, touch screen, GPS navigation, video player, Internet browser, Google map, etc.). This phone does everything that any smartphone should do. Full-fledged features at this price point- Touch screen is surprisingly good and responsive too. Attached is a video with my attempt to use it- Phone is handy enough to operate. I was skeptical initially thinking about the size of the phone- Comes with the latest android version loaded in it. Hopefully will have the updates also available when the new one comes- Has both fingerprint and face unlock options. Fingerprint unlock is fast enough- The camera quality is good enough for basic needs & especially at this price- Has 5000 mAh battery and should give 2 days of use after each full charge- There are literally no additional apps pre-installed on the phone and come clean from bloatware out of the box. Very user-friendly software- Build quality is nice overall & the phone looks elegant overall- Phone is lightweight overall and handy to use- It is very reasonably priced for the features it offers- Power adapter is included in the package to charge this phone, however, it is not a blazing fast charger- They do bundle a clear case and a screen protector in the package- Comes with 1 year of manufacturer warrantyCons:- It only has the 4 GB RAM and of which 1.9GB is already occupied by the Android system, hence does not leave so much room for heavy applications or games. I wish it had 6 or 8 GB of RAM- Slow charging speed with 15W as per current market advancements- Does not support 5Ghz Wi-Fi network and hence you will be limited with WiFi speed at 2.4Ghz- This is not a 5G phone and hence not future proof- Camera is overall good but picture quality can't be compared to iPhone ones- Not compatible with any CDMA networks. The buyer should consider this before purchasing it- Only 1 year of guaranteed software updates and that could be a big concern for a few picky customers- No IP ratings for water or dust proofing"

Continuously locks up into a black TCL logo screen, even in the middle of the setup. I should have listened to the reviews. Returning to Amazon asap. To bad thought I like the styling and features. Update :I was prepare to return this TCL 30se phone back to Amazon for a refund. I have the return bar code on my phone and just needed to drop it off at kohlâ€™s department store. I decided to try setting up the phone one last time. This time I didn't install the sim card or the SSD memory card.  I did a clean install without using the cable to transfer my files from my old phone which is a LG premier pro with Android version 10 to the new phone. I manually programmed every step in the setup process and the phone started working. I installed the sim and SSD card everything connected then I started to delete the unnecessary apps and updated the remaining ones. I loaded the remaining apps I needed from Google play store. I've been using the phone the past several days and I still have 20 days of my 30 days warranty left to return the phone. I don't think the phone is slow at all. But I never had a expensive phone before."

4429,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,the only reason i will not give this phone 5 stars is for 139$ its super slow ! what the heck  the Quality and and pictures are AMAZING but the time it takes to do things is just nope  THATS CHINA FOR YA  i guess
4430,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"I have only had Android phones so I can't speak to any iPhone comparisons, but for me this has been a great phone so far. I have had a series of LG's for the last few years and they have all been pretty decent, but my latest LG (K51) was pretty unimpressive from day 1. Slow, laggy, unresponsive and prone to freezing, it mostly disappointed me. Decided to try this TCL based on other reviews and the fact that it works on T-Mobile and shares the same SIM card size as my K51. also got it on sale on Amazon for only 118$ so why not give it a try right? After a week it has been great, good battery life and very smooth and responsive UI setup. Haven't taken a ton of pictures yet but the few I have taken seem decent enough. Face recognition works great as does Smart lock with trusted Bluetooth devices. Swapping  SIMs worked no problem for me on T-Mobile, did not need to visit the phone store at all just switch and go. Based on a week of use I would recommend this very highly for the budget cell phone shopper!"
4431,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"This was meant to be an upgrade to the TCL that I already had but it wasn't really, except for space.  I wanted a bigger screen for better text size reading and it wasn't that.  Google asks you on and on and on to give permission for their take over and don't explain what you are getting into.  SOME Google is okay, but this is a take over.  Has some nice features if you can wade through all the permissions and managing you!  I want a phone that feels like mine and not a company's!  Phones are getting too complicated to be useful!  I want to be in charge of my own life, not turning it over to a take over company who wants to milk you for all they can, and DO because you don't realize what you are getting into.  I was greatly disappointed because I liked my earlier TCL.  And the magnifier on there was a hassle to use, because it was narrow and time consuming to use.  Older people spend money too!  And some are vision impaired and still need a phone.  We're not stupid at all, just need a little help for seeing!"
4432,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"It's been awhile since I last had a TCL smartphone....a few years & it died suddenly. I have now had this TCL 30 SE smartphone for a couple of months now & so far, not too bad.Pros:  Good battery life, decent-sized 6.52"" LCD screen, seems to run fast enough & not very laggy for the most part, rear fingerprint lock/unlock feature, enough internal storage space [128gb] for apps, pictures, videos, music & so on, decent quality video playback on its screen, decent video recorder & 4GB of RAM for light gaming. Cons:  Not so good still photo qualities indoors and only fair photo qualities outdoors. Also, hard to find protective cases for this phone. Overall, it's a pretty good semi-basic smartphone that is nicely sized that should suffice for basic use such as phone calls, texting and looking thru apps. It's not a gaming phone for sure, but mild games will work most likely on this phone. I ordered another one but the 64 GB storage version that otherwise is identical to this version for my other phone I have. 5 stars I rate this phone"
4433,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"Setting up this phone was easy, great battery life, good picture taking, and visually appealing. Speakers are not that good, and WiFi isn't 5Gh (which is fine by me). Overall this is a great phone for such little cost and I love it (Android 12 on this thing is awesome). When I'm listening to music or enjoying videos, earphone's with Bluetooth work great, or speakers, because it's sort of a must have with me when I'm using it."

4436,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"This is a nice basic phone. A few details worth noting are that you cannot transfer apps over to the SD card.

Overall, the phone meets the needs for browsing and video watching."

It came in two days, and I was worried it was gonna have a slow responsive operating system but it did not, it is lighting fast and the camera is great quality!

Â I got this phone to replace my old one and I love it! This is a great quality phone for a good price and it is definitely the upgrade I needed. It has a super sleek and simple look that I really like. I like carrying around a phone that doesnâ€™t just work great but looks good as well. The phone looks very similar to many other high end phones that are being sold today. It has a pretty large screen which is nice for watching videos or making video calls on it. The battery life in the phone is super good and lasts a very long time. This phone runs much better than other phones at its price.  Other ones Iâ€™ve tried have overheated easily or shut down a lot but this one doesnâ€™t. The screen on this phone produces very clear image and it doesnâ€™t ever lag. The camera quality is actually really good which is great because I love taking pictures on my phone. This phone has a good amount of storage and is more than capable of storing all of my apps and photos. I really like this phone and Iâ€™m definitely glad that I picked it up!"

4475,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I purchased the F3S to replace my Umidigi A7 Pro which I purchased in 2020. I was reading about this device and could not find it on Amazon.ca but did find it available on Amazon.com. Shipping to Canada was much faster than I had anticipated taking only 4 business days to get to me. I've used the FS3 for a few days now and here are my first impressions. First off the setup was the easiest I've ever had with a phone(not sure if that praise is to Google or Umidigi or both), I was up and running with all my apps downloading in under 5 minutes. The device arrived with the battery at around 90%. There was a system update waiting after the initial setup. If you haven't used a Umidigi device before one thing that surprises me is their continued update support. The day after purchasing this device I received a system update for my 2 year old A7 Pro, a lot of manufactures will stop releasing any updates a year after they are released Umidigi breaks this norm. The packaging was very slick and simple, it did not give the impression that this was a budget device. The device was very secure in the packaging no jostling what so ever. There were also stickers on the front and back of the device showing the features and layout of the phone which was handy. The package also contains a USB Charger/good quality cable(looks the same as the cable that came with my A7 Pro which is still functioning after 2 years). There is also a gel case that comes with the device, it is good quality but I find that it can get slippery to hold, I have ordered two other cases to replace it. The phone operates smoothly for my day to day tasks, the battery lasts me the day and if I forget to plug it in overnight I still have about 20-25% battery in the morning. It can also handle gaming as well(although the device does get fairly warm). The finger print reader has so far been very reliable not many misreads and no lock outs. The shortcut button is a handy feature although one draw back is it will only function when the screen is on. I've set mine up to: Flash light, Camera, Voice Record for single press, double press, and long press respectively. I did have a minor issue with reconnecting to hidden wi-fi networks but was able to resolve this by going into the developers options and disabling ""Wi-Fi scan throttling"" it seems to be a battery saving option, if you don't need to connect to a hidden network you will have no hassles. The speaker is a single speaker it does the job but its not anything special, I rarely use it I prefer to use headphones. The FS3 also comes with a headphone jack which comes in handy when your ear buds die or are misplaced(hahaha). The headphone jack is on the top of the phone and the power cable plugs in to the bottom, I would have preferred them both being on the bottom but its not a big issue. I've trusted the Umidigi brand the last few years and when I needed a new phone I looked to them first because I knew I was going to get the best bang for my hard earned buck. So far I am very pleased with the phone and hope to get a few good years out of it."
4476,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I got this as an ""update"" to my last Umidigi phone - an A11 - because, while I really liked the A11, I've gotten it in my head that I need a phone with NFC capabilities.I'm glad I decided to pull the trigger on the purchase, especially considering the price on Prime day.As always with Umidigi, the packaging itself is attractive, eye-catching, and high quality by itself. The phone inside of that packaging is the same.The screen size is great for watching media and the back of mine is a sparkling black color. All of the Umidigi phones I've had have been made of high-quality materials - both the screen and the rear of the phones are basically impossible to scratch. I'm absolutely *terrible* at holding onto things, so I drop my phone on hard surfaces multiple times a day and keep it in my purse pocket along with my keys. Despite this, I haven't had a screen or screen protector on an Umiidigi phone break or scratch at all.Not only is this F3S fast with its 6gb of RAM, the fingerprint sensor is *extremely* responsive and the battery has lasted me though 36 hours of relatively constant use. The NFC feature is honestly just fantastic. I've used it far more than I probably should have in the seven days I've had it with no problems and I'm so glad they included it on this model.The camera is really nice as well. The shutter speed doesn't have any delay and the image quality is very good. I haven't really had many things to take photos of because the weather has been terrible and my house is a mess, but I got a *really* good picture of my cat in pretty low light (I also included an accidental awesome picture of her from when I was trying out the ""burst"" mode while she was grooming herself in this review even though it's a bit blurred because she was moving lol)The only problem that's come up on this phone thus far is an issue with the notification volume being super loud sometimes, even when the phone is on silent. I did figure out that this is an Android issue (as opposed to a manufacturer problem) because I found the solution on a Pixel forum - for anyone experiencing this, the OS apparently gets the notification and media volumes mixed up. All you have to do is turn your media volume down to fix it. Kind of annoying, but not a particularly big deal.If you *do* happen to have any actual phone problems, Umidigi's customer service is absolutely top notch. They're super responsive and very helpful. I haven't had any real issues since a couple of phones ago, but any time I have needed to contact them (obviously within the year warranty), they've responded within 24 hours (not including weekends) and have solved my problems quickly - including being happy to replace a defective unit."

Â I've had several UMIDIGI phones before, but this one really stands out.  First, it's the right size for me (I'm 6'4"" and have a big head lol).  It fits perfectly in my hand and feels ""just right"" when making a call.  No fumbling with a smallish phone in my large hands, yet fits nicely in my front pants pocket.  It's amazingly light, too.This listing does a great job of describing the features and the reviews do well too so I will only emphasize ones that stand out for my own use.  They describe the screen as ""cinema-like immersive visual experience"" and it no hyperbole.  It is *stunningly* smooth, no shadowing and has absolutely incredible viewing angles.  It has a nice size for video viewing and is large enough to use for ebook reading.  It's actually the first phone that I found reading ebooks to be comfortable on, without eyestrain.It is fast, too.  Boots immediately and is very smooth between apps.  Battery life is really good too, but isn't too much different than my last UMIDIGI phone.  The very best thing is how well the thumb-based fingerprint reader works!!  This is the *ideal* location for a reader, as it is right where you naturally hold the phone and is on the button to open it.  I have never seen a reader work so fast recognizing and how fast the phone itself opens!I have but 3 negatives - this phone is awesome and loaded, so why not 2 speakers in stereo?  The screen is cinematic and gorgeous, and the absence of this is regrettable.  The next 2 are a bit of personal preference - while the camera is incredibly good, I could do with a bit lesser camera to have to have less of a camera bump.  I go caseless (it is gorgeous and made of durable material) and it rocks all over the place when on a desk or table.  While using the included case alleviates this, it still rocks a lot with it on.  Lastly, while UMIDIGI made the ""Beyond Dreams"" tagline less obtrusive than my previous phone, it is still there and just bugs me.  Just go with your brand and perhaps the model number.I tried to get some nice screenshots and a video of the smoothness of it but I cannot capture how nice it is in person.  It's first rate, comparable to the top of the line phones of other manufacturers.  At this price, it is a terrific buy that will serve well for years to come."
4478,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Let's get this out of the way early, once again Umidigi has created a beautiful phone. I chose the 'Starry Black' over the 'Ocean Blue' this time and it's just as stunning as the blue is.Highlight #1 - NFC  - let me repeat, NFC that supports Google Pay, on an inexpensive phone for the U.S.A. market = #Winning.Highlight #2 - A full 6GB of ram and 128GB of LPDDR4X based storage. Storage is expandable.Highlight #3 - 5150mAh Battery. Coupled with the entry level Unisoc T610 Octa-Core Processor, which basically sips battery, this phone should get you through a full day of useage without breaking a sweat.Highlight #4 - 6.7-inch Display. It's crisp and clear and does surprisingly well outside. Ok, the colors are going to be washed out in bright, direct sunlight, but at least you can still read the screen if the need arises.Highlight #5 - Sony 48MP AI Triple Camera. I;ll need to read up and take some picturesHighlight #6 - Still comes with a headphone jack. Bluetooth still doesn't quite cut it for audio performance and I am glad to promote a phone that still includes a headphone jack.Highlight #7 - They have included a wall charger in the box.For us old-school peeps who still listen to FM Radio, Umidigi has included one. And gome one step farther by NOT requiring a headphone to be connected to be used as an antennae - it works without one just fine.A quick stop at some niggling points: the auto-brightness algorithm could use some improvement and Umidigi doesn't exactly provide timely updates, but does seem to release an update to fix issues.Th UI is basically stock Android. No fluff, no extra, duplicated, unneeded apps.Fingerprint reader is integrated with the power button which is on the right side of the phone beneath the volume rockers, and is as responsive and accurate as expected.On the left side of the phone is a 'smart key' (button) that you can use to initiate up to three different actions such as: screen shot; start recording; open an app.I've gotten some pretty good pictures although I haven't tested the 'night mode' yet. There are standard and 'pro' shooting modes along with HDR and some different filters to enhance your shots and selfies.I still don't know how Umidigi continues to roll out mid-range performing phones and feature sets at bottom-tiered pricing."
4479,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Bought this specifically for the NFC and WIFI calling capability.

Interestingly the Flir camera actually connects and is visible in the program but then immediately disconnects and terminates the program.  This obviously indicates the phone is capable of the connection and appears to be ""coded"" or programmed to terminate camera operation. When I contacted the seller they said the camera will not work and is not supposed to. Thus four stars."
4480,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I got this phone I liked the phone however it was a 3G phone which most companies no longer support it is not a 5G phone which it is listed under  please change the wording on this phone

Â For the price I paid the phone has everything that I need without breaking the bank. It features a large screen, plenty of storage (128gb) and generous amount of ram (6gb). For this price point I had been looking at phones with 4gb ram and 64gb storage.When first turning on the phone I went through the setup quickly. The fingerprint reader is a must have and I set three fingers with ease. Unlocking the phone with my fingerprint is seamless each time without hesitation. I went to the OTA updates and updated the phone right out of the box, took a few minutes and everything was good to go.Having Voice over LTE and Voice over WiFi is great, it helps the call clarity and VoWiFi for when I'm in a poor reception area. Dual SIM is nice so I can use my personal and work line both on the same phone. You can disable the second SIM when not needed (so my work calls don't come in after hours).The 6.7"" screen makes things very easy to read and view. Playing games works very well for the screen size. It would be nice to have a faster refresh rate but I didn't expect this in the price bracket.The processor, gpu and ram make for a smooth experience for everyday use and handled all my gaming tasks without hesitation.The camera takes good pictures but the response time seems a bit sluggish when moving the phone around. But in all fairness I had compared this to my wife's phone which is the S22 and cost over $1000.The battery is quite large and lasts me a few days with work, games and day to day activities before I need to charge it up.Overall I'm quite pleased with my purchase. Getting the features that I need, and performance that I feel will last me a few years if not more before I feel the need to upgrade."
4482,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I come from Blu G90 Pro and wow with 6GB of ram makes a big difference performance. Screen is bright clear video. Game is not too bad but Helio G90 can tell difference in game. Great phone if your looking for clean android user interface. Umidigi F3S is speedy.
4483,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Phone is great for the price and nice looking.  So far it works fine.  Great that it has large storage size.  Camera quality is not very sharp.  Maybe need to adjust setting.
4484,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Overall an excellent phone for the price with some nice features that exceed the price tag. Phone is very similar to other phones classified as mid end phones.The box comes with a charger, USB type C cable, pre-installed screen protector and phone case. The phone has a good macro camera with a screen that exceeded my expectations for the price tag. Also the 6GB of RAM and the ability to lock apps makes it really easy to multi task. There are 2 key features that exceed the price tag of this phone. First, NFC which is something I need in any phone in order to use Google Pay or scan my house and car keys. Second, the Smart Key which is an extra button on the left side of the phone which is also customizable (see pics).Cons:The single speaker is loud enough but coumd be a little more clear."
4485,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The Umidigi F3s runs lag free, The battery is exceptional, it gives me about a day and a half of use, The camera takes vibrant and well detailed photos, the phone display is bright and good at it's price point. There is 6gb ROM and 128gb of RAM enough storage for all your apps, photos, videos and music. I also like the fact that it's dual sim. Overall it's a great phone at it's price point making it well worth the money."
4486,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Everything good, maden with care, packed with accessories and most handy: 3 in 1 programmable button I use for telegram, teams and flashlight."

Â It's hard to find a reasonably priced phone with good features, but this one seems to come through in a lot of areas while still keeping the price pretty low. 128 GB storage, 6 GB ram, 5,000+ mAh battery... It's hard to complain about this phone! The multifunction button is the cherry on top for this new budget offering from Umidigi."
4488,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Nice product with good capture and navigation.
4489,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I pick this phone and was told it works on the Verizon network. But it doesn't.
4490,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I have had it with my Umidigi Power 3 phone! I absolutely will never buy another product from them. From the first it did NOT work as it should on the most basic of functions of a cell phone---making a phone call! (the sound was barely audible on phone calls even at highest level with using speaker I had to yell at all times when making a call). This occurred as soon as I activated this phone. The screen then cracked shortly thereafter from a very SMALL drop of say 3 feet from my back pocket onto the kitchen floor (linoleum tile). I got my money back though. Maybe their newer phones are better...but I just wish someone warned me about Umidigi cell phones as I researched and believed the hype....what do I have now? a motorola and it too is a brand I will never buy again... its got a bad chip issue which makes ghost calls and the  ringer works only when it wants to.....

4505,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Update: 4g stopped connecting and their customer support is a joke. First impossible to contact then impossible to get any answers.Considering prices inflation these days, you will be having a very hard finding a phone that cam do pretty much everything a top liner would do. The price starts at 240$ tax so imagine when they are on a promotion, the price would be even better.First of all the design is beautiful, I mean the colors and the glass back panel. I am not a big fan of iphone like cameras arrangement but that is fine. The front screen has just a small dot on top which serves as a camera.Some people complain about connectivity when they insert a sim card but I havent experiences anything similar. I would suggest to read the manual carefully and contact the seller, I am pretty sure it could be figures out.The fund works as a charm, it has a prety good battery capacity and it allows it to last for around whole day. Depending on usage of course. The camera doesnt take the best shots but they are still decent. Remember the price and lower your expectations. It allows you to surf internet, play games, do your work, listen to music, study, etc. And all that with ease"
4506,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The overall design of the phone is really good. I bought the blue version and it's as in the picture. The phone came in a yellow box with a cable, adapter and papers (also a sim card remover).The phone itself is really powerful because it never lags. it has 6 gb ram and a lot of storage (128gb).As you can also see in the pictures the camera is really good, it takes realistic photos and especially with vif colors.Finally the battery serve well because it's quite big (5150 mah).The phone has also nfc which is great.In short, it's a good phone for pretty much anything : gaming, social networks, youtube, photo shooting..."
4507,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I took to my retailer buddy to program. He deals in pricey phones was impressed with this one .can't go wrong
4508,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The phone is good, it's built well and the screen is bright and comes with, a free silicone case. I don't have much complaints but I did exchange it and got a premium device that is better suited for my needs"
4509,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,For the price it works perfectly. I'm on Bell and calls and data work awesome. Comes with a clear plastic case as well as a preinstalled screen protector.
4510,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"there's a bit issue about the phone, but customer service was great and they help me resolve it.amazing battery life and great phone for the price"
4511,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,For the money this phone is perfect I don't need the top of the line for what I used so umidigi never dÃ©sappointement me
4512,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,No complaints so far.
4513,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Lors de la premiÃ¨re utilisation le tÃ©lÃ©phone me semblais bien cependant a la premiÃ¨re charge il n'a mÃªme pas charger au complet et un message d'erreur est afficher
4514,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"My wife needed a new phone, as hers was acting up and being unreliable. So I came across this brand, as I remember reading good things about the brand, and reading many reviews and studying the specs. On paper this seems to be a good phone, much better than the Motorola one that my wife wanted to get from Costco for $200. After researching the phone for a while, I decided to order it and give it a try, shipping was fast and arrived the next evening. Opened the box, set up the phone, transfering everything over from the old phone was a breeze. That's where it stopped being a great phone. It couldn't stay connected to WiFi, constantly disconnected without my wife noticing this caused her to go way over her mobile data limit and resulted in a nice extra on the phone bill. Next, call quality was very bad, person on the other end of phone would hear a computerized like voice, with constant cut outs making calls and conversations hard to have. Lastly the camera which is supposed to be 48MP was very grainy/blurry, and the zoom was only 2x which make the picture quality worse.It's too bad since it is a very nice looking phone, maybe I got a lemon, but maybe not. Anyways I returned it after a week of using it without any issues with the return. Didn't want to take a chance and exchange it for another unit."
4515,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"UMIDIGI F3SI spotted this phone and was impressed with the specs to price point.It has a 48 MP camera on the back which takes really nice pictures. I haven't had a chance to take any night pics yet but think that will be good as well. The front camera takes nice selfie pics as wellAndroid 11, lots of internal storage and a spot for an SD card as well.It also has a second sim slot which will come in handy on the next trip down south.I am writing this review on the phone right now and the screen is nice and sharp.I am looking forward to using this as my daily driver."

4517,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Overall, definitely a phone worth it's price. It has good storage and RAM, great battery life, and the 48 mp camera is fantastic. The phone is slimmer and longer than some other phones, allowing it to fit better within my hand, without losing any screen size. The package includes not only the phone, but a simple clear case and a charger (USB Type-C). My one slight problem is some of the UI preferences that I have not been able change to my liking, but I will get used to those over time. As always, UMIDIGI has given me a phone that I very much enjoy with a very affordable price."
4518,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"So far I love it! Very smooth, very fast.  Light weight but not too light where it feels plastic. Audio is good, very clear. Could have a little more bass but not complaining. Pictures are actually excellent. I'm comparing them to my iphone 12 Pro. I'll see how the battery life is but so far its good too. The next thing I would hope to see is wireless charging for this. Comes with its own phone case. But overall, this is an amazing phone for a great price."
4519,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Jâ€™ai commander ce Umidigi comme telephone de backup, mais il mâ€™as beaucoup surpris. Performance / prix trÃ¨s intÃ©ressant. Sont seul point faible est la qualitÃ© des photos. Fonctionnel, mais loin dâ€™un iPhone. Jâ€™en suis satisfait et je recommande!"
4520,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I bought one of these in August and like it so much that I bought my wife one. Great camera on it. It holds a lot of apps and runs all of them great. Lots of memory in it too. I would put it up against other phones that are in the 500-600 dollar range..
4521,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The F3S with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage is a nice step up from the A13S I was previously using. The apps are snappier, able to handle more open apps at once.I know this is a cost effective phone, but my only drawback is the slow response of the screen. You can see the refresh rate while scrolling through facebook and Instagram, but I'm also spoiled with my Pixel 6. The screen is bright, the face unlock is great.I noticed that this F3S supports dual sim, but you have to sacrifice the microSD slot, where as the A13S has both sims and a MicroSD. But with the 128GB you likely won't need the SD anyway.The camera is much better, with the Sony 48MP lens. Still a bit of a lag between button press and shutter though.Again, comes with a silicon case and screen protector pre-installed. Love this.All in all a decent phone. I would recommend."
4522,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,This is best  budget phone  for less price with more features .
4523,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Ce tÃ©lÃ©phone a plusieurs qualitÃ©s :-lÃ©ger-plusieurs choix de couleur-bel Ã©cran qui est assez lumineux pour la lecture en plein soleil-Android en version Ã©purÃ©e-trÃ¨s bonne camÃ©ra pour le prix du tÃ©lÃ©phone-chargeur et Ã©tui fournisQuelques points Ã  mentionner :Le bouton option est placÃ© de faÃ§on Ã  ce quâ€™on puisse lâ€™utiliser pour des commandes usuelles comme une capture dâ€™Ã©cran. Cependant, le fait que le bouton Â«Â powerÂ Â» est aussi le moyen de dÃ©verrouiller le tÃ©lÃ©phone avec une empreinte digitale on se trouve Ã  accrocher rÃ©guliÃ¨rement le bouton du cÃ´tÃ© gauche (option).

4525,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,I really liked the price of the phone. The camera is great and the updated features of this phone.
4526,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,I've never broken a phone screen before. This renewed phone is in awesome condition!! Cheaper than replacing the screen on my shattered phone.
4527,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,"This phone works better then my new phone I received from Verizon, had problems with that phone, haven,t had any problems with this phone, so far. Setup very easy. Battery life, last approximately 3 to 4 days. Very fast charging."
4528,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,I haven't used the fingerprint or voice recognition feature yet but the phone works great.
4529,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,"Great Phone at a Great Price! Wife checked  mine, ordered one for herself. Says refurbished,  phones appear absolutely New!"
4530,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,My A11 was starting to have problems and I saw good reviews about the speed and camera of the A42 plus the affordability of 5G capability. It was quick and easy to transfer everything over and works splendidly! ğŸ¤—
4531,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,"Absolutely love the Galaxy A42,  I got the phone on August 15th and got it activated , this phone is a great phone, the battery life is really good and it just updated to the Android 12, I got a heavy duty Poetic case from Amazon and the phone still isn't heavy. The Infinity Amoled display is beautiful..I would definitely buy another phone from the gadget deals the phone looks to be just as described as excellent condition, not a scratch or blemish...I would definitely getting a Samsung Galaxy A42 because you won't be disappointed, the phone is responsive with no lagging or freezing up as I've seen others say.."
4532,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,"This is the second time I've ordered a ""renewed"" phone on amazon.  It is the best way to purchase a phone.  No pushy salespeople who are only interested in getting a commission.  The phone was easy to set up.  It has been working with no issues and my daughter loves it."
4533,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,"Nice phone, looks brand new. Would buy from vendor again."
4534,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,OK if just for talking as needs more ram.
4535,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,"I am not on any phone contracts.  I am about 5 years behind the curve and run a phone into the ground.  All I care about is reception, battery life, and basic smartphone functionality.  The bells and whistles are nice, but they don't decide a purchase.  I usually shoot for $150, so this was a splurge.  My first foray into Samsung after sticking with Motorola since my first smartphone.  I had on model Moto I kept getting because it was perfect.  Kid broke it and it couldn't be replaced.  The moto I had next was a disappointment.This phone is not.  The splurge was to acquire 5G.This phone meets all expectations.  Battery life is great.  Bought it refurbished and the quality of the phone for the price I paid is unbeatable.  The fingerprint reader is finicky compared to Motorola, but I have simply saved multiple profiles, which has helped in that regard."

4537,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,My elderly mom was having trouble using her Moto Z phone.  It was so sensitive that just handling it caused applications to start.  The samsung A42 has changed all that.  Very easy to use and navigate and it doesn't launched apps by just looking at it.
4538,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,"This phone is great for work or utility functions.  Despite of the screen issue that some are saying. , I can't tell the difference between 720 and 1080p.It would have worked out for me except for the fact that Verizon disabled most or the data configure buttons. You could see them but they were all greyed out and non-functioning. Had to return.The seller gave a fast refund. Thank you Perfectly Professional."
4539,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,Worked just fine until the last update.  Now just freezes and is difficult to get it to work.Battery life is fantastic!
4540,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,I was hesitant to buy a refurbished phone but I've been pleasantly surprised with the condition it was in and how well it does. Had no issues with it so far. Popped my Verizon card in and it was good to go.
4541,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,Love the big screen.  Battery is good so far.
4542,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,"It's to early to have an educated response for this phone, I will admit that so far I really like this phone.  I am having fun trying all the new stuff.  My last phone was an IPHONE 8, huge Upgrade. Looking forward to seeing what this phone can do in the future."
4543,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,LOVE THE PHONE AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT
4544,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,"I've been using this phone for a couple weeks now, and it's great! Can't tell that it was renewed, it feels brand new. The battery life is great; it lasts a day or two for me before I need to charge it again."
4545,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,I had the same phone and dropped it and the screen broke. I was thrilled to find this on Amazon. Fast shipping and my phone works great. No problems and stays charged literally all day. Highly recommend!
4546,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,"I was advised this phone was on the Verizon network and IT DOES NOT!!! I have purchased refurbished items previously but NEVER HAVE I EVER brought a phone and it cant connect to the network.  Why cant people be transparent about products/services they sell? Amazon, please look at your sellers, third party and all.  This is not for those who sell their products and services legitimately. Just for those who want to take our hard earned dollars. shame on you!!!!"
4547,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,the phone showed up a day after I ordered it in fine working condition
4548,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,This was a refurbished phone and my husband warned me about it but I got it anyway.  i have always had Motorola phones but needed something with more storage.  Being on a budget I chose the refurbished Samsung.  I have a Samsung tablet and love it.  This phone got very warm after just a few minutes on a phone call.  i assume this was the battery.  Also when I picked it up the icons on the home screen moved to different places on there own!  and the fingerprint worked about once every other time T tried to open the phone.  Very dissappointed in performance and quality.
4549,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,"This is a rating review for Amazon Renewed product and not for the phone itself.Not the first time I buy refurbished / renewed products but first time I try an ""Amazon renewed"" products.Not sure how this was tested before being shipped or how the phone is renewed but I'm guessing the screen was probably replaced but not installed correctly. Screen became unresponsive after 5 days.I returned this product and bought a new A42. The phone is really good btw..."
4550,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,Worked so great bought another one.
4551,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,When I turned on the phone it was at 11%. Plugged in the supplied charger and cord and came back two hours later to see how far it had charged. It was now at 13% but now I smelled what seemed to be something burnt. I reached for the charger to unplug it thinking that after two hours it should have charged more and the charger was very hot. As you can see from the picture it got very hot. I have no idea if this caused damage to the phone.
4552,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,"Great phone, it's not compatible with major phone companies"
4553,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,The camera hasn't worked since the day I got this and a month later Im still waiting on the replacement that was ordered last month and twice more since then.
4554,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,"Was not compatible with ATT.  This sucks. I requested a refund not a gift card.  My bill balance has not reflected that.  Will never spend over $50 with you all again.  I need my refund back on my card balance, not a gift card."
4555,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,This is literally the worst phone I've ever bought in my life. Only a couple months and in the battery drains half a day of being used or just sitting even on battery saving mode. I don't know if it was just defective product from the seller or if it's just the phone but I don't recommend anybody buying
4556,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,Phon already use
4557,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,Easy to use and been a great investment.
4558,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,Verizon phone but when arrived we had already decided to switch carriers because Verizon had raised our rate because of 5 G and hot spot....We took phone to T Mobile and switch sim card no problem...So far I love the phone and the camera is great..Thanks for another good product and a great price
4559,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,Great condition.  Love my phone
4560,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,So Far I am impressed with my Vzn (renewed) Samsung A42 Smartphone.  My husband bought the same phone a few weeks prior to me for $100 more and neither of us can tell the difference  So far I am very happy with my purchase!!!
4561,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,I have no complaintsworks great battery last for two days
4562,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,Quit working 2nd day and chat couldn't help me but it started back. Call volume won't stay loud enough even when not touching controls. Message said I had duo Sim cards and it has just one.
4563,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,"I have spent 3 days taking this phone to Verizon, Best Buy, Spectrum, Target, etc. and NO one can open it. Every place said it is locked to the original owner and cannot be undone except through that person. This is VERY  unfair to someone who needs a phone immediately! I have written 2 previous reviews on this and amazon will not post them!"
4564,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,"Very pleased with the presentation of this refurbished phone. It looked brand new in the box.It doesnâ€™t have the features of my Samsung Galaxy but will be a good first smart phone for a senior family member.It arrived fully charged, a nice touch. The charger and cord worked well."
4565,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,"It looks good but there is a large crack on the screen. At first glance, you may not notice it if you are indoors, but you can see it when you take it outside. The are not original box and charger."
4566,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A42 5G 128GB,128 GB,Android 11,6.6 Inches,"Wow ğŸ˜² I bought this phone for a friend, he didn't have much to spend but he had completely destroyed his last phone so I took a look and wow If I hadn't told him about the phone I might have kept it. It's the nicest phone he's ever had And the price was perfect! Thank you I will definitely let everyone know where I got it!"
4567,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,"En el tÃ­tulo de la publicaciÃ³n del celular, dice claramente que incluye un cargador para auto, sin embargo, no estaba dentro del paquete."
4568,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,"La verdad que no me fijÃ©, si mencionaba, que tenÃ­a una pequeÃ±a muesca en pantalla, fue lo Ãºnico que no me gustÃ³. TenÃ­a un protector de pantalla donde se ve la Marca."
4569,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,De muy buena calidad en sentido general
4570,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,"Used with Mint Mobile. Microphone doesn't work on some calls. Pretty annoying. Never had it with other phones, even a flip phone didn't get me this much trouble. Great battery life, I donâ€™t use the original charger because itâ€™s not compatible with Americaâ€™s wall power sources. First time Xiaomi user, great customization capabilities and it brings more updates than a Samsung tablet. Camera sucks with low light."
4571,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,Muy buena bateria dura dos dias con buen uso muy bonito color excelente calidad precio

4576,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,"Es un dispositivo muy bonito, se siente muy bien y cÃ³modo en la mano. Es de buena calidad y como descrito en la tienda y en las fotos.No le doy un uso muy demandante, pero estÃ¡ bien como funciona, aunque para ser el 11 de los redmi note debiÃ³ tener mejor procesador, pero no ha dado problemas por Ã©sa parte. El sistema miui en si, sÃ­ que da problemas, para no confundirlo con el celular.Me gusta la carga rÃ¡pida que tiene y viene nuevo y completo, hasta cover transparente trae!Es buen dispositivo, lo recomiendo!"
4577,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,Me agrado
4578,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,Xiaomi needs to make cell functions easier to manage. Like the Lite 8
4579,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,More than I expected
4580,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,"Excelente vendedor, envÃ­o rÃ¡pido, aunque no lo tengo en mis manos, porque me lo envÃ­an a un casillero y del casillero a mi domicilio se estÃ¡ 15 dÃ­as mÃ¡s"

4582,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,Buen producto
4583,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,Excelente oportunidad para un regalo
4584,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,"Phone space is great. Not as user friendly as my last android phone. Has organizational features, but it's taking some getting used to. Battery life is very good for the most part. Charges quickly too."
4585,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,me agrado que como los describieron asÃ­ mismo saliÃ³ al altuculo que tienen una decrision pero cuando ya lo tiene a mano es diferentepero quedÃ© satisfecho con esta compra
4586,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,"The phone was ok. About a month in it started having Bluetooth connection issues. Android auto couldnâ€™t connect. Smart watch would also lose connection. I also had issues with screen recording. If you screen record certain things, the recorder would automatically get stuck and not finish the recording. I would definitely not recommend this phone at all. Do not buy."
4587,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,"This phone made me regret buying another Xiaomi Redmi. My older model was much better than this new one, probably due to the shift from Snapdragon to Mediatek. This phone will constantly freeze, clear your RAM for no reason at all whne you switch apps, causing you to lose data if not saved, and the battery life sucks."
4588,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,"Celular muy prÃ¡ctico, comodo, fÃ¡cil de usar, larga duraciÃ³n de baterÃ­a, tira buenas fotos! Lo compraria de nuevo"
4589,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,"Very fast shipment. The phone works fine so far. Included free transparent case and attached protective glass are good to have at the beginning, will serve the purpose while looking for better ones."
4590,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,phone looks good. front and rear camera looks good.
4591,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,"The total capacity of the battery should be 5000 mAh, but I just opened it and it has a 3683 mAh total capacity according to various apps like Accubattery and developer logs directly from the system.I knew the camera was bad, but this quality is unexpected in 2022. Also the phone doesn't run as smooth as it should."
4592,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,El terminal es excelente para el precio en el q se sitÃºa

Â El cargador llego sin una parte para conectar a la corriente"
4599,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,Horrible horrible camera! All the pics come out blurry. I have spent dozens of hours researching of there is any setting that can fix it but nothing works. Itâ€™s a poor camera/AI setup.It would recommend spend few more dollars and get a better product as you use it all the time.. why go for a poorly cheaply made product
4600,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,I buy this phone 4 month ago... And today my cellphone do not open nd it's impossible for me to contact the seller.... I'm very very disappointed...  200 dollars in the void
4601,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,"The description says it works on the t-mobile network. It doesnâ€™t. I tried it on both Mint and Tello, and it couldnâ€™t connect to the network on either."
4602,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,Lo devolvi
4603,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,
4604,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,This phone is slow. It will not open many of today's most popular apps.  The apps that will open take a long time to open.The Bluetooth keeps disconnecting.  The screen completely freezes up.  I have had to shutdown the phone and turn it back on to get it to work again.
4605,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,Todo bien muchas gracias por su esfuerzo para todo salga espectacular
4606,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,Excelente

4608,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,Muy buen telÃ©fono calidad precio.
4609,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,
4610,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,Low price for a very decent smart phone that works well for my daily usages.
4611,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,En el RD te funciona super bien.
4612,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,"good storage capacity, battery long lasting"
4613,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,First Xiaomi phone and so far it's great quality battery life good as well and camera is perfect
4614,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,Surely this is one Redmi Note phone you'll want to buy if you want a almost premium smartphone and cheaper to your pockets. Doesn't weight a lot and have a good specification
4615,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,"Me and my roommate bought the same phone, it's working perfectlyI'm planning to take it back to the Dominican Republic so I can verify if is actually unlocked, but so far I'm so in love with my new phone."
4616,Xiaomi,NOTE 11,4 GB,Android,6.43 Inches,"Justo como marcaba la foto , me encanto"
4617,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"Fingerprint reader works great until you add a screen protector then forget it. My old S8 had the reader on the back and avoided this issue. Can't understand why they took something that worked well and changed it. I also preferred the screen press over the double tap to wake the phone up. Battery life, memory, camera etc. are all great and I recommend this phone as long as fingerprint reader is not a deal breaker for you.The phone is like new and the delivery was fast. Would buy again from this seller."
4618,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"The phone itself is fantastic. By far the best smartphone I've ever owned! Huge super clear screen with a fast processor. I am extremely pleased with the phone. However the seller indicated the phone was in excellent condition and I have to disagree. There were several scratches on the front of the screen when I received it along with a few on the back. what's on the back  It's no big deal but I would expect a phone listed in excellent condition to have no blemishes visible when a phone case is on it. Extremely disappointed in that. if I were to see the phone beforehand , i would not have paid the excellent condition price. It was good at best."
4619,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,There is no issue till now. I did not expect this will be such a daily phone. Absolutely recommended.
4620,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"4, not 5. Although the phone gets top marks for performance, who in their right mind made the decision to make the back of the phone out of glass?! Of course it cracked immediately. Luckily it wasn't a total loss.  I bought a hard case for it. Hopefully that will be enough."
4621,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"I was worried about buying a refurbished phone for a few reasons. Some negative reviews claimed they got phones that were locked to specific carriers, others said the quality of the phone was not good. But I'm very glad I took a chance because the phone I received is indistinguishable from a brand new phone and is fully carrier unlocked. The battery life is fantastic, it lasts all day. No scratches on the screen or case at all. The camera is excellent and it does have full 5g capabilities. I would 100% recommend buying this phone if you are in the market for an s20+ but you can't spend a thousand bucks on a phone. Really great deal for a really great phone."
4622,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"It was like brand new. Came with charger, cord and sim removing key no scratches whatsoever. I love it. Great price and purchased assurion I even got insurance for 2 years and still beat the price of other sellers for just the phone.  Thankyou plus it's 5G, LTE 3G, 2G compatible"
4623,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"I just received my phone yesterday.  It arrived quickly.  Due to previous reviews where customers stated they received an FE, I went out of my way to make sure I got what I paid for.  I also ordered the wrong case for my phone which led me to believe I might have received an FE instead.  It was easy to confirm the storage on the phone, but wanted to ensure it was unlocked too.  I went to the T-Mobile store as I needed a new SIM which is 5G capable knowing my outdated S8 SIM would not work.  I paid $10 for this convenience (I'm not willing to wait to receive a free SIM by mail).  Going this route ensured I got what I paid for and erased my doubts.  Of course, phone was unlocked as my line was eaily ported.  I am currently in the process of setting up my phone, transferring data, updates, etc.  Once this baby is good to go, I'll report back on features.  So far, the phone was received in NEW condition.  I went with this model for the Micro SD expansion capabilites.  I'm still ticked the AUX is gone, but I'll live.  I'm excited to have upgraded to this new (old S20 model).  I don't need the latest technology.  I needed the upgrade because my S8 is no longer gettting the updates.  So I absolutely love buying renewed/refurbished tech.  Today's latest soon becomes yesterday's news anyway and the quality is the same for less!  BRB with updates.My guess on people getting the wrong stuff is they hit the wrong purchase options when ordering.  Make sure you hit the features/service you want.  Hit UNLOCKED and the storage you want.  Sure it's possible they got the wrong phone sent, but seems to me it's more likely the wrong item was ordered (inadvertantly).  I'm sure there is a digital footprint of how orders are placed here online... So it's best to check before accusing the seller of bait/switch."
4624,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"Phone was in very good condition, I ordered the fully unlocked because I'm from outside the USA and yes it was T-mobile network or software but fully unlocked to my carrier just very minor scratches on the top and bottom of the phone, screen and back was like new, knowing it's a refurbished device I'm satisfied ğŸ™‚"
4625,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"For the most part the phone works and is in good condition. The issue is that the phone is not compatible with visual voice mail on the verizon network. My previous Moto phone which was also purchased unlocked worked just fine with Verizon. I spoke to Verizon tech support and the claimed many of these ""unlocked""  phones do not support all the features available for a particular carrier and in the case of this unlocked phone visual voice mail is not available or supported. Typically if you buy this phone directly from the carrier the voice mail feature is pre- installed  by the carrier. I will wait for the seller to get back to me and see what they want to do.  So be be wary that unlocked does not mean all features will work with your carrier"
4626,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"The phone works and looks amazing. There are a few very small scratches on the sides of the phone, but they are easily overlooked, especially for how well the phone operates and the price I paid for it. The only issue I had with the phone is that it appeared to be locked to AT&T and I had to go to a few stores to see if they could unlock it, and someone was able to, but at the cost of $38. That is the only thing that is really damaging this review. I understand that I could have returned the phone and gotten a replacement for free, but I didn't want to go through all the hassle. Other than all of that, I am very pleased with my purchase. No regrets."
4627,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"Great cell phone, with awerithing you need  !!Thank You ğŸ˜Š"
4628,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,Came in perfect condition and works amazing. Super happy with this purchase! Will get again and recommend to others
4629,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"I had this Samsung S20+ for about a week and i love this phone!!!Mine was a refurbushed model, not a single scratch on it, looks brand new & no issues when i turned it on the first time & no issues since then.Yes, it did NOT come with the Samsung box, Samsung cable & usb wall charger. I personally do not care! due to i have a box full of samsung usb cables and wall chargers from my old Samsung phones i bought before.It did come with the tool to remove the sd & sim card & that is the only thing i needed.I had no intent & plan of upgrading my samsung s10+ to the samsung s20+. But at the price and buying prior refurbished samsung i am beyond happy i did it!First, The 5G is very quick & compare to older version what ever its called. which i did not believe until i went online away from my house WIFI service and its very quick. Note: not areas have 5G service.The overall phone response is very quick and smooth. The bixy button is gone (thankgod).The quality of the screen resolution is outstanding & wow its clear! It has a few more minor whistles & bells features compare to the samsung s10+ Nothing to noticable. I do like the new front camera location and its small size & its looks better. I also like you see less of the frame around the curved screen. I know & dont care if there is a technocal name for it.Overall the phone looks great & i didnt get a case this time due to i think looks better with out one. I know, but i rarely & never drop my phone (my s10+ back up)Reference to the camera & quality of the picture which was not a selling point for me. You will notice a much better picture & video quality.The phone over all is a tad thinner & tad taller which i think it makes it easier to hold and use.The battery life seems to be better but i have not fully tested it yet.Charging it seems to be quicker & again i have not fully tested it against my s10+.Now, is the samsung s20+ worth buying if you already have a s10 & s10+???Personally NO!!!!!I love my s10+ its great phone! The only reason i got the s20+ was the price $700. But if you can afford one (full price) or find one at great price like i did then YES get one!!!!I could have lived very happy with my s10+ with no regrets if i didnt see this s20+ on amazon!"

4631,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,Item had no scratches and came packaged well and was 512gb internal memory as described.
4632,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"Phone did not have protective ""screen leaflet"" as described. The adhesive on the bubble wrap was stuck to the screen. Phone did not come with original charger, so I had to pay $20 for a charger. The charger the s20+ came with isn't recognized sometimes as a fast charger. I'll never use the fingerprint or face scanner, so I don't even know if that works. Phone did arrive scratch free and a 0% charge. Still a good investment."
4633,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"The Samsungs have always been the best phone for me! I have had very few problems with them over the years. I don't like the fact we are buying the same thing over and over again with just a new name and new number attached to it! I mean come on... just because it is another year down the road does not warrant paying $1,200.00 for a phone! Sure there are similar for less, yes. I give you that. I am merely talking about simple logic here. I mean.. what does 5G do that 4G didn't? I rant, but overall this is a great phone! This one I got for my fiance for the pretty cloud blue color! I wish it had a 256 board instead of the 128, but beggars and choosers saying! Lol mine has the 512 board for lots of un nessesary pictures and videos to have to download every month to my computer. Speaking of which! The camera is yes, absolutely ğŸ’¯ the boss for a cell phone! Finally a level of camera that is worth $300 or so to me! Very beautiful pictures! You will not be disappointed! So far battery life is comparable to my S8+ I just upgraded from! That was a kick a#% phone and camera all around good investment! Lasted me 5 years and is still in perfect working condition! Never broke a screen, just one corner of an awesome case! Pilot the same screen protector and case on my new S20+ and so far so good! ğŸ‘Œ I definately recommend buying refurbished! There is no need to pay for brand new when used works just as good for less! Save some space and waste on our planet!! Please!! I have not used the facial recognition,  the bio metrics are enough for this old dinosaur! Besides you can save multiple prints for different directions if access! I do love the screen clarity and size! I watch alot, I mean alot of movies on my phone! Great color and clarity and sound is improving!! I hope to keep this phone for the next 5 to 10 years before being suckered again! Lol peace out!"
4634,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"The phone is great, like-new appearance and functions perfectly. Fast shipment and the price was very good. Small issues with the packaging: it shipped with a too-small 12.5 watt no-name charger, causing slow-charge warning from the phone. This phone when new shipped with a 25 watt fast charger. Replaced with a 20 watt charger, works fine and very fast charge. Also, the product listing says package contains a SIM ejection tool, but it was not present. Not a problem, already had one."
4635,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"I have been pleasantly surprised with how good this phone is. It works and looks perfectly, and even shipped a day early. and the fact that I got all of this for Half the normal price is nothing short of incredible. Only reason I give it 4 stars is because hardly any packing material was used. Thankfully my phone wasn't damaged, but it could have been. A little bubble wrap goes a long way"
4636,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"I am very pleased with my purchase.The phone arrived and is exactly as described.It is a new phone tho they say it's refurbished It is new and completely unlocked so activating it with my existing service was easy and transferring my photos, contacts, etc was also easy. I definitely would buy from this seller again as I am very happy with this phone and saved money as well.I can't really say anything bad about this phone as it's exactly what I wanted"
4637,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"1/30/22 UPDATE: While out at an event last night, not really sure what happened, but when I tried to GPS my way home, my phone would not connect to Google maps. It said my calibration was extremely low. I did what it said to do to recalibrate, but that did nothing. Now I cannot send text messages either. It says I'm connected to my home WIFI, but nothing will go through. I'm lowering my star rating because this phone keeps getting worse and I will definitely be returning itI did months of research before purchasing this phone. My Samsung Galaxy S8 was four and a half years old and was getting pretty glitchy and low on storage, so I knew it was time, but I just couldn't get myself to spend $1,000 on a brand new phone. So I researched different phones, different places to purchase those phones and ultimately found this one for about $525 on Amazon. When I received it, it looked brand new and I even had to peel the protective plastic off of the top and bottom of the phone. The phone is beautiful and the picture quality is outstanding. The cameras are amazing and make even a novice photographer like me feel like a professional lol. I noticed right away, however, that my text messages were not being sent as quickly and I was getting the no service signal ğŸš« a lot. While at my mother's house for christmas, I could not send a text message without standing by her living room window or going out into the driveway. That never happened with my Galaxy S8. Although I did switch service carriers, I had started noticing this issue prior to the switch, so I do not think it reasonable to blame the service carrier, since the issue started right away. The other thing I have started to notice over the past couple of weeks is the screen's response to my touch. Things are opening when I'm simply scrolling, or I try to expand a notification and it instead swipes it away. Or I click on the screen to type and it clicks in a totally different spot. So I guess it would be the touch sensitivity, possibly because they replaced the screen, from what I was told by a cell phone repair shop the other day. I have been in contact with Amazon and they have made a note that I can return the phone, however, they will not send me a replacement. I have to repurchase the phone through another vendor. And I've been unable to find this model phone for the same price that I originally paid, so if I return it and repurchase, I will be spending more. I have up until February 24th to make the return, so I haven't decided yet what to do. I tend to keep my phones for several years before replacing them, so if it's glitchy now, that causes me to worry about what may happen going forward"
4638,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,First let me say that I definitely got value for my money because nothing about this thing looks used. No scratches or dents and all features work. The phone really came fully unlocked and battery life is superb.
4639,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"PurchasedSamsung Galaxy S20+ 5G, 128GB, 0 Blue - Fully Unlocked (RenewedWireless Carrier: Unlocked for All CarriersLiked the phone but couldn't make or receive phone calls. After 2 stops to phone provider and still didn'twork. Finally stopped at Samsung Experience Store. Phone is locked with T-mobile and only primary owner can unlock the phone. What a hassle!"
4640,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,Great experience with this seller.  I had to deal with customer support and they handled the matter promptly and politely.  So far so good with the phone.  Came from a S10 so battery life is great in comparison as of now.  Love the camera as well! Only complaint thus far is that the touch screen could be better when navigating the phone.
4641,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"Reensamblado deficiente, la tapa posterior no estÃ¡ completamente fijada o le falta adhesivo, solo vino con un cargador genÃ©rico que no logra cargar el dispositivo"
4642,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"Good used unit, work as claim. Wish Samsung gave more option in term of what part of Samsung junks to install ( a boat lots of them)"
4643,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"I have bought a number of different 'renewed/refurbished products in the past (including a Dyson vacuum about 14 years go that is still going strong) but this was the most expensive thing by far. I wasn't sure about going for a renewed phone instead of new.However, I bit the bullet and bought an unlocked, renewed, 'Cosmic Black' Galaxy S20+. It came well packaged in a plain, but sturdy black box, with a short USB - USB-C charging cord and adaptor to plug into a power socket. No ear buds included but I don't want them anyway, and it's part of reason for the lower price. The packaging, phone and accessories all look brand new, so that was a relief.It seems to be a special 'limited edition' version with a little bit of 'bloatware' to do with a Korean boy band. However, that's no big deal for me either, and the version sent out now may be different anyway, I guess.It has all the bells & whistles it's supposed to have ( and that I was hoping for) plus more. One thing I did check immediately was that it had the all important Snapdragon 865 processor inside, not the less popular & powerful Exynos 990,After having it about a month I'm still finding new features buried in the settings, but I've been in no rush to dig around in it. The most important thing I care about (after actual phone call quality, of course!) is the quality of photos and videos it produces and they're great, so far. The camera aspect of the phone has lots of features I haven't tried, including a mostly manual 'pro' mode, and I'm looking forward to getting to know it all properly.So far, I'm very pleased indeed."
4644,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"For some reason, the screen protector is glued onto the screen and was misapplied. There was dirt under the screen protector. I noticed that the fingerprint reader was horrible compared to my older s9 but figured it was just because it was on the screen and I had the screen protector on. But when I got a new one I tried peeling the old one off and it was literally glued on where the fingerprint scanner is. I suspect this is why the fingerprint scanner works maybe 5% of the time. Now I am going to have to struggle to get this broken shard of glass off of my screen so I can apply a new protector.also, if you get an s20 from this vender and it looks like theres a circle spot where the fingerprint scanner is, its not supposed to look like that. Its supposed to be a completely clear, regular screen. thats glue, I thought it was a special part of the screen that was more sensitive and less clear for the fingerprint scanner, nope."
4645,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"I bought this phone back on Nov 9th of this year, and wanted to wait to do a review, just in case of any glitches or problems. My old Samsung Galaxy phone had only 16gb of memory with SD storage of 32gb. I was frustrated having to delete apps to make room. I wanted a cell phone with more memory and capabilities, but I definitely didn't want to pay the high cost of a new one; so I decided to take a chance, and got this renewed/refurbished one from this seller on Amazon. It's so amazing with 512gb internal memory, SD card expansion up to a terabyte and 5G compatable. It arrived in pristine condition, not a scratch on it, charger included, I did need to have Verizon send me a new sim card for 5G, keeping my same number, free of charge. I have to admit I was leery about buying a renewed/ refurbished phone, but I received the perfect phone to fit my needs. I have no complaints just excited about a great experience. The phone arrived quickly, well packaged, just not in the official Samsung box which is no big deal. Like I said it was in pristine condition, just like a new phone, and I couldn't be happier."
4646,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,I waited an hour to have my S20 +5G connected to my network only to find out that it was locked and could not be connected to my network. It won't work with T- mobile. It's too bad because there wasn't a scratch on it... Oh well I guess it's back to shopping for another deal.
4647,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"TLDR phone arrived with the glue on rear panel not properly set, and only reason we ain't returning is because she needs a new device anywayThe adhesive used to hold the rear panel is weak around the bottom corner along the edge with the power/volume buttons. As seen in the above image, I was able to spread it apart enough to make a noticeable gap with only my thumbnail.This was an issue we experienced immediately after opening the box and finding the back was not entirely flush. Canâ€™t return as wife needs a new device desperately for work as her old one's glass display is shattered to the point of flaking shards while the digitizer is no longer able to recognize her thumb (again, her old phone).As a result we intend to take the new phone to the local cellairis shop and pay them to fix the adhesive."
4648,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"Everything about the S20+ phone itself is awesome. I have not had any issues with it so far. I have a very old unlimited Verizon plan and didn't want to change it for 5G. I did try activating the new phone with a 5G SIM but it wouldn't work without changing my plan, even the Verizon store guys were not able to do it. I upgraded from an S5 so I had to get a new SIM card. My old SIM was micro only and the S20 is nano only. I thought about just shaving off some of the plastic but since Verizon corporate stores will give customers a new SIM for free I just went there. They were very helpful. The new SIMs come in all 3 sizes. I put the new SIM in the old phone and activated it at the Verizon store, popped out the nano version of the 4G SIM and moved it into the new phone. It works great on the 4G network.The disappointments came with the accessories. First there are no headphones at all; I expected it come with at least generic versions of the standard accessories. Second, the power cable that came with the charger is only that, it does not work for data at all. That took me a while to figure out but with the savings from Amazon refurbished t's not a big enough issue for me to return the phone. For $20 more I'll just order a headphone adapter and another usb-c cable. The lack of standard accessories should have been more clear in the description."
4649,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,Hubby had to replace his old phone so we got this one. Works just great. Had to do a lot of updates to be up to date but its on par with my samsung 21+.
4650,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"Face recognition doesnt recognize me, but in another identical phone it works for the GF. Great upgrade from the Galaxy 8+. Overall, I'm happy with the phone"
4651,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"The product arrived at the right time, the equipment is impeccable, without any detail, the battery lasts as if the equipment were new, the only negative point is that it is not a samsung unlocked from the factory, but a unlocked att equipment."
4652,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"The seller describes the phone as being in excellent condition. It's really not.The machine came with a visible white scratch on the back. And a green dot on the screen. It came with a cheap screen protector, but it was full of fingerprints (I will defiantly remove it). It also came with a very slow charger, but nothing to complain about here. Better than nothing.Other than that, the phone seems fine. But I would probably would not buy it in that condition if this was not an online purchase. And I think that calling this an excellent condition is misleading. Again, the green dot especially worries me (as well as the scratch, which indicates that the phone has fallen and might have internal damage). I would probably send it back if it were an easier process."
4653,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,Love the phone the only thing the battery go down faster than it should. Hope I didn't spent all this money n the battery die soon that would really such. Will update if anything shall happen. Cell was delivered very fast thanks needed it but didn't know for others if you work let the seller know so then he can let the shipper know...I didn't know n missed cell twice being at work. Called FedEx but msgs are not given to drivers
4654,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"Una gran inversiÃ³n, solo faltaba que venga con la caja y pasaba por nuevo a un precio exageradamente barato, lo Ãºnico que siento diferente ya que curnto con otro S20 +, es que su calidad en la cÃ¡mara estÃ¡ distinta al otro que vuelta toma en mayor definiciÃ³n, lo demÃ¡s historia."
4655,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"The battery is not good. Last about half day... but the phone is clean, no scratch, everything works. Just battery issue."
4656,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,Phone itself was in excellent shape however I ordered a Verizon locked phone . This phone was fully unlocked which disables certain Verizon features that I need .
4657,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"Honestly, the phone looks brand new and is working like a charm. I am really happy with this purchase."
4658,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,Dropped calls
4659,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,Works great I love this phone if your trying to get the best phone for your money a used one from Amazon s20 plus it's great around 400 buck but remember I bought a cheap galaxy a42 from Samsung for 370 and it was horrible so for en extra 30 buck you get a high line phone the whole A line from Samsung it low grade phones the s line it what you want to buy
4660,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"This was supposed to be a fully unlocked phone that was not tied to any particular carrier. However, this was a T-Mobile phone. Not what I wanted. So I returned it."
4661,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,Bought as an Amazon Refurbished item. The description of the condition was conservative. I could not detect any physical wear. So my expectation was exceeded. I was surprised though by the multiple OS updates to go through to set it up. That took several hours. Just wish I had known in advance to expect it. But all is well. And registering this unlocked phone on my Verizon account went smoothly.
4662,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"I waited too long, or I would have returned this phone. The phone looks good and works like itâ€™s supposed to, with one exception: it wasnâ€™t updating for a newer Android version or security patches. I kept checking for updates, but nothing was happening. It said it was on Android 10 and up to date, but the last security update was February 2020, 19 months ago. I checked the Verizon and Samsung websites and found that it should have received more than 20 updates since February 2020, including Android 11 in December 2020. When I started investigating, I found out it was unlocked even though it was listed as a Verizon phone. Verizon doesnâ€™t update unlocked phones. I asked the Amazon vendor how to update the phone. Their response was that it has to be updated via the USB port with no additional details.After several days of calls arguing with Samsung on chats and phone calls, I took it to a Samsung Experience Store. They discovered that although the country code was listed as U.S. Verizon, the phoneâ€™s IMEI disclosed that it was originally registered in Korea. The phone had been heavily modified and repackaged in a different case. The Samsung technician was able to flash the phone to update to Android 11 and the latest security patches, but because it was so heavily modified, they refused to do any future flashes, which will be needed since it wonâ€™t receive OTA (Over The Air) updates. While inspecting it, the technician also discovered that one of the camera lenses had been damaged in the rebuild.After this experience, Iâ€™ll never buy another reconditioned phone."
4663,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"The S20 Plus 5g I received was in immaculate condition! Worth every penny. I've had it for 2 weeks and it's running like a brand new phone. I couldn't be happier with the purchase. It may be a 2 year old device but it is supposed to receive updates for the next 2 years, which is great. Still tests well vs the new S22. The S20+ more RAM, a better screen and expandable storage. Definitely worth saving $500"
4664,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"The phone was specifically listed as a Verizon unlocked phone. Instead, I received an unlocked phone that would not complete activation because it had Sprint designated in its firmware. I would've returned it sooner, but a Verizon rep told me it would be fine, since I was making and receiving calls...meant I was activated. But shortly after the 90 day return period expired, I started having problems making and receiving calls, and a new message saying that I  could only make emergency calls. I contacted the seller in hopes that they would make it right since they sold me a product that was not accurate with its description. But, regardless of them selling me the wrong phone, they wrote me back just saying they wouldn't exchange it for me because my 90 days had expired. I understand warrantees, but I also understand shady business practices. And if this seller screwed me over...they'll do it to you too. So don't buy from them!!!"
4665,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,Visible's website said the imei number was not compatible on their network. I put the SIM in anyway. Works great!
4666,SAMSUNG,S20+ Plus 5G,128 GB,Android,6.4 Inches,"Got this phone as an upgrade on my S9+ which got full. I like the ginormous 512GB capacity, 12Gigs of Ram and available SD Card option. The inscreen fingerprint scanner is classy and works well and the facial recognition is great. Battery life is great and the reverse charging is pretty cool. I think I am going to keep this phone for a long time."

4671,ZTE,Blade A3 Lite,32 GB,Android 9.0,5 Inches,"It comes with go edition data saver Google apps. I remember when FreedomPop tried to upgrade everyone to new voice SIMs and many posted the old phones they had didn't work when they upgraded, so seeing recent bad reviews getting this working I thought one of my old FreedomPop or Unreal Mobile SIM cards would get it going and it did. I have not tested newer SIMs on it. The back cover was very hard to get off. It works $5.50 a month 1.1 gigabytes and VoIP calling I'm good with it. It even downloaded the Dasher app. We will see how that works later God willing"
4672,ZTE,Blade A3 Lite,32 GB,Android 9.0,5 Inches,Phone was not compatible to service. Returned so I honestly can't say since I never used it. Gave it 3stars because I didn't know. Ask someone else that has used it is my advise.

4675,ZTE,Blade A3 Lite,32 GB,Android 9.0,5 Inches,Somehow their tech support won't immediately tell you this but once you get through a sufficient number of levels of tech support they will say their network does not work with this phone.

4684,ZTE,Blade A3 Lite,32 GB,Android 9.0,5 Inches,"You're better off buying a used model of a better phone, as this one is plastic-y, cheap, and the OS is choppy and poorly designed.

4690,ZTE,Blade A3 Lite,32 GB,Android 9.0,5 Inches,Delivered fast and well packaged. When looking online for a service provider I got similiar responses that the phone is not supported. I went on a chat with a provider and they responded the phone is not programmed with voLTE and is not supported for use in the US. It would be a great candidate for a wifi tethered phone with a text app. Unless I find a remedy I will have to return it.

4693,ZTE,Blade A3 Lite,32 GB,Android 9.0,5 Inches,This phone is very subpar the back of the phone was pretty hard to come off I appreciate the back of the phone not coming off easily but it shouldn't be so hard to open if you want the user to access it and the instructions didn't help because they were only in Spanish. I put my dad's consumer cellular sim card into the phone and it couldn't make or receive calls. And finally the desplay quality is absolutely atrocious if you turn the phone just slightly off access everything will look super blurry and discolored. These are some things I thought I should highlight before you decide to go through and purchase this phone
4694,ZTE,Blade A3 Lite,32 GB,Android 9.0,5 Inches,I got a phone for my daughter because I didn't want to buy expensive phone I wanted to see shoes responsible and he comes out dead it's not compatible with T-Mobile services .

4708,ZTE,Blade A3 Lite,32 GB,Android 9.0,5 Inches,"I absolutely do not like this phone. Screen is small and phone is slow, laggy and won't charge while plugged in. I knew this was not an expensive phone but I didn't think it would be this bad."

4713,ZTE,Blade A3 Lite,32 GB,Android 9.0,5 Inches,Bought this for my son to playinecraft with us. This phone does not even support minecraft.
4714,ZTE,Blade A3 Lite,32 GB,Android 9.0,5 Inches,The description states the phone works on GSM networks including T-Mobile. When I tried to activate it T-Mobile came back and stated this phone does not work on their system. I would not recommend purchasing this phone unless you have actual verification from what ever carrier you want to use it on that it is compatible with their system. Don't go by the seller description.
4715,ZTE,Blade A3 Lite,32 GB,Android 9.0,5 Inches,Do not buy. Phone doesn't work. Powers off automatically when has a sim inserted. Going to factory reset mode every 5 minutes. Was unable to get a refund for the 2 I bought. Poor quality

4725,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"The phone is great and it has been working fine. If you get it I would recommend to buy also SSD card as once the internal memory get about 80% full, your phone will become slow."
4726,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"It'sreally dificultfor me to .  use the phone's various functions and find instructions.  I got my first cell phone in 1989 so I shouod be abole to handle the improvements. but maybe my 90 years of age are slowing me down, but I definitely plan to keep the original purchase.  I am handicapped snd livinging in an assisted living facility and not near a drop off place such  as KOHLs which is probaby more than 30 miles away,  An Amazon van delivery vehicle stops at Brookdaleseniorcenter at least once a day,  and is one of the reasons I 'M a  prime member at Amazon.  Especially when so much advertising is devoted to free return.cthat convenience is one  of the reasons Isenior"
4727,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"Okay so Nokia delivers with this two SIM cellular phone! You get an exceptional value for a very good made phone by Nokia. I was amazed when the other day it said I had a system update available, and it was Android 12! Not even Motorola has updated my Moto G Pure yet to Android 12, just to let you know how much of a surprise this was to me. Just a little suggestion when you activate the phone and start putting it together just do a fresh take on everything. Reason being is if you do a copy over from your other phone, the way Nokia does things with their contacts is a little different than how they do it with other phones, so you're going to get some things just not quite adding up together if you know what I mean. Other than that go for it because it's an excellent value, and the phone has not given me any problems whatsoever, whether with the two SIM or anything else for that matter."
4728,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,Bought this to use as a second phone. My primary phone is a company phone and is restricted from using social media. This allows me to use any apps I want so far. Maybe not as fast as my Galaxy s22 but certainly more than effective as a 2nd phone. I bought it because a friend had one from Mint Mobile as his primary phone and he loved it. Dual sims lets me use it with my old FreeUp account and my Sprint account.
4729,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"This is the worst phone I've ever bought. It is so slow, you have to wait, sometimes up to 5 mins for it to "" wake up"" if your in a hurry to make a call, or check email this phone won't work.It freezes all the time. If your one one thing, won't be long till it will pop in with something you looked at earlier.I've had people try to call and the phone won't ring, won't do anything.Please don't waste your money, maybe spend a little more to get something that will work."
4730,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"Pros:Really great screen (big, bright, pretty... don't let the ""720p"" fool you; 720p is pretty dense on a smartphone, and it's not the only thing that matters)touch IDheadphone jackgreat priceup to date AndroidUSB-Cdual-simmicroSDgiant battery (has lasted me 3 days without charge before)Google assistant buttonCons:so slow!too largepoor quality camerasthe speakers have no bass at all, making them sound weirdcrashes occasionallycan't connect it to my car like I can with Apple (probably an Android problem though)face ID doesn't really workI would recommend this phone for people with a small budget. I'm constantly surprised how much I got for my money, all things considered. However, if you have even just a hundred or so dollars more, I would highly recommend getting a better phone. This phone is unbearably slow at times, and I can't stand having to wait upwards of a minute for my phone to start up so I can make a simple call."
4731,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,The screen suddenly went blank and became non responsive. I tried the reset - power and up volume button numerous times to no avail. I can hear the phone ring but am unable to answer. I checked an online help forum and there were numerous users with the same problem so this is clearly a bug Nokia needs to fix
4732,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"I bought this as a burner phone, and chose it because it has a USB-C charging port.  Compared to a 4 year old OnePlus, this Nokia g10 is slow, sluggish, laggy, kludgy.  The screen protector collects so many fingerprints that it's difficult to see through.  I would not want this as my primary phone.The most important thing to know, that isn't mentioned in the description (as far as I can tell) is that this  phone runs Android One - a closed-source Google OS that is based on Android, but dumbed down.  If you're expecting a mainline Android phone, this is not it.  It's intended to bring new people to Android platform with inexpensive $100-$150 phones.Also note that this phone is compatible with normal GPS, and also China's BeiDou global positioning satellite network rather than Russia's GLONASS.While initiating the phone, you're prompted with about a million choices that you can opt out of the vendor collecting your personal data.  Be very careful as most of these are presented as ""NEXT"" buttons, and the skip options aren't as obvious.  Don't be tempted to click through all the options without reading first!Nice that it comes with a screen protector built in (though it's a finger print collector) and it comes with a very basic flexible clear plastic case to cover the back."
4733,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,Nice phone. Nice price.
4734,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,Purchased for a gift.  Nice quality.  DOES NOT COME WITH SIM CARD OR SERVICE. Picture quality us great.
4735,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,great product
4736,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,Lots of problem with Nokia phone I would not advise any one to buy
4737,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,But great vale for money. I charge only once a week.
4738,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,I wish I had brought a Samsung phone
4739,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"So I bought two of these phones to send to Ghana for family. The good thing is they are able to use the phone seamlessly, however the network is terrible and the phone gets dangerously hot, Iâ€™m not sure if other have experienced that."
4740,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"I got it today and found out that the The 180-day T mobile service as mentioned in pic 6 is NOT included. The product link is misleading. I even verified from an Amazon customer service representative before making the purchase and she confirmed it will be included. Turns out it's not and the representative I talked to after the purchase could hardly understand what I was saying. After wasting half an hour with him, he finally understood what I meant and said it was not included.Other than that, the phone works fine!"
4741,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"This just didn't work for me, I couldn't get out of apps, battery life didn't last as long as it was supposed too, could not personalize it, used up the memory fast."
4742,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"I owned a Nokia phone that I purchased while living in Hong Kong and it was one of the best phones I have ever owned. But this phone is nothing like my old one. The specs are about the same but this phone is so slow and booting takes FOREVER!! I have tried everything, even did a factory reset and update but nothing changes its jut a POS and I am immensely disappointed. That said, its cheap and if all you need to do is call and get texts it does that and the battery life is decent, if you need more power for apps, look elsewhere."
4743,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"As per Nokia's misnamed ""customer care team"" because they clearly could care less about their customers, their developers intentionally stripped the ability to enter recovery mode from this phone and all other Nokia phones produced since Android 9. What this means is if you are like me and want to preserve what little privacy these devices offer by choosing to disable the Find Your Phone feature, and you are unable to unlock the lock-screen with your PIN for any reason, your device is effectively bricked. Nokia support refuses to provide instructions or software that will allow you to restore your phone to factory defaults. Your only option is to ship your phone to a Nokia service center and hope they are slightly more competent than the support team. They claim this is because customers abused this functionality and bricked their own phones, and rather than making the process easier or safer they decided in their infinite wisdom that it would be a better idea to take that functionality, which is common on ALL mobile devices, completely away without disclosing this fact to new or existing customers. They appear to be completely ignorant of how utterly insane that decision is. Based on my experience with the Nokia ""customer care team"", not only will I never purchase another Nokia product again, I will be filing a complaint with the FTC. I would rather buy a new mobile phone from a different manufacturer than ship this piece of garbage to the service center, even though my G10 is only eight months old and still in warranty. What a sad joke this company has become."
4744,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,second one of these we bought. first was for the lady of the house. had lots of Nokia phones (over the years) and these are the best yet and represent our move to Android.Dropped in our SIM and memory devices and mine worked fine. Bride was moving from a Windows Nokia so we had to buy new mem card and AT&T gave us the new SIM for her phone.Battery life is EXCELENT...seems to last a week (we do not live on the phones).Only issue is that one of the chargers (part that plugs into the wall-not the USB to type C cable) does not work..we get by by using the same charger for both...which is easy due to the long battery life..
4745,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"Android One phone with Nokia affixed on it. Battery life and unlocked status, are questionable"
4746,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,I bought this for my 70 year old mom and she loves because it's easy to use
4747,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,Has good features but slower than expected. Nice phone. Couldn't be my primary means of contact. Accommodates 2 micro chips and a memory card which is important to me. They need to work on the speed though
4748,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"UPDATE: After 3 months, 1 of the 2 of these Nokia phones I bought has died. Not a very long time. Also, the performance of this phone is really lackluster. It's just way too slow and most apps crash. Look elsewhere.I ordered two of these phones, one for me and one for my wife in their respective colors, for use in Mexico. They made it here and work great with both Telcel + AT&T in Mexico. I like the look and feel of the phone(s); the color is really nice and it feels like a solid build. The display is very passable and the speakers are also good quality. It feels a little slow with just 3 GB of RAM, but it's bearable. I like that it comes with a screen protector already on as well as a clear protector case. I am happy with my purchase overall; worth the price."
4749,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"phone lag after  about 4 days,,had to make recovery..Phone is prety fast."
4750,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,great value vs. Samsung or iPhone.
4751,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"This is a really nice phone with great features and doesn't come loaded with bloatware. I purchased it to use in Mexico with Telcel. I put the Telcel SIM in, booted it up, completed the set up and that was it. Takes nice photos, has good battery duration, carrier and WIFI call quality is very solid, as well as with apps like WhatsApp and Duo. I never expected this level of quality for the price and was pleasantly surprised!"
4752,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"Phone description states it's a 6.5 screen and that is incorrect. The screen is a 5"" screen. Phone is good but way smaller than expected."
4753,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,Es un tanto lento y pesado. Como telÃ©fono de emergencia estÃ¡ bien. Para diario. No.
4754,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"This phone is slower than a donkey in a horse race. If you have lots of patience, this is the one for you. If you donâ€™t have patience, please get something else."
4755,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,It takes good photos.but it's just too slow I mean slow like a device from 10 years ago.i have to wait for it to load each n everytime for everything.it states it has a 3 day battery and I have not had that experience at all.i charge it all night and get up and start to use it @10 ish w it at 100% by early evening it's at 20%.not even a whole one day and no I don't have a ton of apps running or windows open.it does charge fairly fast but my last moto was way faster and did last 2 days but the screens on them all shattered when dropped even having extra large case on them.so I will be returning this.those are keys points for me long lasting battery and to load alot faster.
4756,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"The phone is not expensive.  It has several nice features.  My main reason for buying the phone is that it has two SIM slots which I need.  However, after trying to set up the phone, I noticed it was incredibly slow.  It took nearly forty minutes to download Google data.  Then, after all was downloaded, the phone was still slow.  I opened the ""settings"" area and found only 2G for wifi choices.  No 5G!Too bad, but what should I have expected for such a small price?For a local user who does not need speed, it is an attractive phone."
4757,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,Got this phone for my dad and was a good price. Excellent value for his needs.
4758,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,SÃºper buenos para viajar desbloqueados lo recomiendo
4759,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"Excelente equipo, tenÃ­a rato buscando algo de calidad a tan buen precio. Excelente duraciÃ³n de baterÃ­a, calidad de las fotos y vÃ­deos, excelente performance, nada que enviarle a otros equipos mucho mÃ¡s costosos"
4760,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,Phone seems to be doing good for the price I paid for it.  It works with the government SIM card
4761,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,Without a doubt the WORST new phone I have ever gotten. First of all it come home damaged. the damn case for the camera lens kept falling off like the glue was to dry before they put it on. It was unbelievably slow and the apps froze and crashed more times in a day than the phone I was replacing did in a week. I aggressively recommend that no one else on this app buy this phone. I knew ppl got crappy phones on here sometimes but never thought It would happen to me but it did. Its not worth the hassle. It made me realize how grateful I was for my old phone. DO NOT RISK BUYING THIS PHONE IT WILL BETRAY YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.
4762,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,Very slow phone.
4763,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,I'm going to return it even though I thought I was going to get a new phone on my budget but I need a phone that works. Consider a different one. I have been lucky until now with Nokia phones in the past but not This one.
4764,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"Good stuff so far, just got it"
4765,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,When I found this phone I was happy because it was a Nokia but in the ad that I saw where I purchased the phone on Amazon the seller has it stating if you read everything through that it has 6 months T-Mobile service in fact it does not when I spoke with the representative he said they would take the ad down if you're reading this review apparently they have not taken the ad down I was not able to try the phone because I am sending it back due to the LIE in the end. The seller should be shut down you are not supposed to have an add up stating you're going to get more than what you're getting in the box. I'm looking for another Nokia and I will make sure that I do not deal with that seller again. All the stars are one because of the simple fact since I'm having to return it I did not get a chance to try out any of the features which I was excited about.
4766,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"Unfortunately you should probably skip this one.  It's Android ONE, so easy updates.  Stock android, great battery life.  But the thing stutters on basic stuff like unlocking and starting the camera or messages app.  Even answering a call is sometimes a waiting game.  Also, the headphone jack broke after two months.  I'm not even super impatient but even I have limits."
4767,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"La resolucion de la pantalla no es muy buena, pero funciona bien para ser un telefono barato."
4768,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"This is the slowest budget phone you can buy, as far as I know. If you truly only need to call people and, uh, maybe listen to music, this is a viable option. But having a few tabs open or trying to play a simple mobile game is off the table."
4769,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,Itâ€™s great. I needed a cheap replacement for my phone and itâ€™s everything I needed
4770,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,This phone functions well. I mostly use it for calls and messaging but it's very smooth and reliable .
4771,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,I like the quality of pictures.
4772,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"The app processing is too slow and glitchy, cameraâ€™s quality is pretty bad. Liked the size, battery life and fingerprint button."
4773,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"Constantly switching from normal to speaker, mute, hold or completely dropping calls without pushing any buttons. Not user friendly. You're on hold with a company for 35 minutes only to have the phone switch to speaker, mute, hold or dropping the call completely on you when you try answering!"
4774,Nokia,G10,512 GB,Android 11,6.52 Inches,"As the title says, phone was working just fine until it decided to update to the new operating system. After that, the battery wouldn't recharge.Eventually my phone battery completely drained and now I can't do anything with it."
4775,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"I bought this particular phone for several reasons. Believe me, I did my research. I have been a Samsung fan for over 15 years owning tvs, monitors, and phones. This purchase did not disappoint. It handles gaming, browser research, bill paying, and texting or phone calls (video or not) all at the same time without hesitation. There is plenty of memory (128gb) and an SD card slot for any needed expansion. I cannot say enough about the camera system! I will not need another camera source any time soon. Amazing! It is a little big, but I find that to be less than a problem. The battery lasts forever as well and recharges quickly. Best phone ever!11/7/22: BUYER BEWARE! AMAZON HAS UPDATED THEIR RETURN POLICY. ANYTHING OVER $300 TAKES 30 DAYS TO PROCESS AND REFUND. I purchased a second Ultra 20 to replace the first defective one as I was misled to believe that 7 days was all the time it would take to be refunded my $395.00 for the defective one. Their customer service consists of their front line phone answering service being backed by a, final, line of supervisors. It is impossible to resolve an issue past this point as there is NO ONE for the supervisors to defer to. The buck stops with them. My return sits languishing in Las Vegas, Nevada while I spoke with two different supervisors in Seattle, Washington. There is no other option for customers to follow up with. If the customer is unhappy, then , so be it.  This poor attention to a very important detail has me pulling my patronage from Amazon as a company. While this is only a drop in their big bucket, I cannot, in good conscience, continue to utilize their services on principle. Take from this what you may.UPDATE: I received my $395 investment  within 3 weeks. However, had I not called several times and closely monitored the status of my return one wonders how long it would have been before I received the refund for the defective phone."
4776,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,I tried this phone as renewed and loved how fast it was but maybe its that I am used to average phones or not but the screen seems so bright and a bit overdone? I changed the display to natural but not to my liking.  The photos were great but I prefer iphone photos more. The important thing is the design of this phone makes it look so outdated and bad.
4777,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"Works great. As soon as I got the phone I put in my Sim card from old phone on cspire network. It worked within a few minutes, and now after a month it's still working great! Only thing I'd say is battery life goes quickly. This is a large phone, so I attribute some battery drain to the near 7 inch screen. I can't make it a day without plugging in to recharge, and I just ordered a new battery to install. Totally worth it for me, as I have the tools plus experience to swap a battery."
4778,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"For a renewed phone, and for 1/4 the original list price, I am very very happy with this.  See photos of internals...this is a speed demon.  I added a 256Gb card, which I'm certain will last a long time.So far,  so awesome... will try to make an update a few months from now...still a bit of a rookie on the advanced features...Also recommended:  I signed up for Mint mobile - uses T-mobile's network.  Popped in the sim card, installed the app, and boom...off the old provider and onto the new.  $15/month for 4Gb data.  Works great!  The hitch: you have to prepay.  The more months you pay,  the cheaper the rate."
4779,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"Shipped very quick and on time with estimated shipping time. Phone was fully unlocked and was able to use a straight talk sim card and get it activated with no hassle. The condition of Phone is very good, only a couple  very very small paint chips where the paint ends and camera lens glass starts. My guess is from where the Phone was set down on a surface without a case on the phone. But to even notice the chips you have to look very close. Very happy with this purchase , would recommend ğŸ‘Œ"
4780,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"So far no issues, excellent condition as described. I've had the phone for about 30ish days. Haven't try the finger print reader since I don't care much for its function."
4781,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"When I first saw this listing I was surprised at the exceedingly lower price for a great phone. At first I had some doubts with me regarding the quality of the phone, after seeing that Amazon included a 90 day return policy I was convinced into ordering. Once the S20 Ultra arrived I was a bit worried with the presentation of the phone being just a small cardboard box with a plastic sleeve barely protecting the phone. The box also included a cheap charger which I wouldn't recommend using it to charge. Having to clean the phone entirely was a bit of a chore but it was worth it as you do not know who's handled it before. I have read countless negative reviews from the sellers (eLGeo) and product sharing how they were delivered incorrect, broken and dirty products. In the end the phone does contain the listed components and works as if it was brand new."
4782,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"While the phones are great and in very happy with my purchase, this is a review of the seller in particular.I recently purchased 2 of the Galaxy S20 Ultra for my husband and me. His phone worked great, but for whatever reason the mobile data on mine just wouldn't connect properly. I tried fixing all the settings manually per my carrier's instructions, but it just didn't work. So I contacted the seller and they were extremely helpful. They provided me a shipping label for the old phone and as soon as they received it, they sent out a new phone. Every step of the way they were helpful, polite, and communicative. I would definitely buy from them again and would suggest them to others."
4783,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,Received the phone there is no way to tell this is a refurbished phone not one blemish perfect new condition the only way is it comes in a plain white box went to best buy and they set it up with T-mobile which is my carriertook about an hour with all the app transferring from my s9 love the fact I could transfer my 512 memory to the s20 Ultra it's the last phone you will be able to use the added memory it's one of the reasons I went with thes20 Ultra instead of the s22 Ultra and  of course the great price !
4784,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"My Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra journey progressed from the S4 Mini (1st personal ""smartphone"") to the S7 Edge  ending 2 weeks ago when the upgrade green-light was given. The S7 Edge began to experience operational issues due to lack of remaining internal space (pending further investigation), so I researched the lot of current Samsung Galaxy S phone choices & settled on the S20 Ultra version because it's one of few available phones that accommodate external storage capacity (SD Card)...a must in a 4K/8K digital landscape. The only ""Included Components"" in the generic white box were the generic *Travel Adapter, *Data Cable, S20 Ultra and 2 cards  (pictured w/replaced S7 Edge). The following from the posted description was NOT received: Handset, AKG Headset, Ejection Pin, USB Connector, Screen Protector Leaflet, Smart Switch Insert, Quick Reference Manual, Terms & Conditions/Health & Safety Guide. As this was my 3rd Samsung smartphone upgrade, I fully charged the phone (arrived at 20% charge) before utilizing ""SmartSwitch"" and was pleased to see 99.5% of my S7 Edge setup successfully appear on the S20 Ultra (apps, files, folders, layout, etc.). I had to find a replacement complimentary black Galaxy Theme for the S20 Ultra & tweak my custom home & lock screen wallpaper/background images in PS to get them to fit the larger screen resolution and layout. Per historical ""Murphy's Law"" insurance, I also purchased a wallet case flip cover w/ID & Credit Card pockets along with 9H tempered glass screen/rear camera screen protector w/Ultrasonic fingerprint support . While preparing the surface for the screen protector installation, I noticed a tiny ""visible cosmetic imperfection when held 'slightly less than' armâ€™s length"" (scratch) on the screen. Nevertheless, it appears imperceptible under the tempered glass & even without the screen protector, the hairline scratch was only visible with a completely black (sleep) screen held at angles. All bio-metric functions properly engage w/and w/o screen protector. I have not attempted to utilize the Wireless PowerShare function with my Samsung Galaxy Buds+ or Samsung Galaxy Watch3 yet, but will return for an update upon usage. Samsung pay functions and all other supported apps seamlessly integrated with my Watch3. Currently the battery usage rate is averaging 1.8 days before needing a charge (supports wireless charging). After the completed SmartSwitch process, my original AT&T SIM card was instantly recognized after powering down, inserting and rebooting for smooth network setup completion finalized by a completed call. After recently researching out how to reorganize the drop down icons (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, light, etc.) similar to my replaced S7 Edge, I'm fully up and running. The ""Renewed"" savings just shy of 50% off a ""new"" model has manifested itself in the form of another seamless integration of a Samsung Galaxy series product."
4785,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"TLDR; originally nervous about ordering unlocked phone; working great 1 week in; fingerprint reader is mehFully unlocked Galaxy S20 Ultra (Renewed) ordered from thegadgetdeals on Amazon Marketplace to replace my Galaxy S9, which I have really enjoyed over the last 3 years but is now too slow and not enough storage for my liking. I went with the S20 rather than upgrading to an S21 primarily because of the expandable storage available with the S20  [I'm bummed Samsung is going away from this - it was one of the great things that set them apart from Apple... boooo!]. Anyway, Verizon has pretty much refused to restock their S21 Ultra 512 GB during the last 4-6 months, hence I ultimately pulled the trigger on this phone.Regarding the product according to the seller: arrived quickly and as promised. Few scratches on back cover that I care nothing about at all (expected as this is a refurb). Otherwise, seems in great condition. Came with a charger as promised. I was nervous about ordering unlocked phone as I have always purchased through my carrier, but I inserted my Verizon sim card, and it seems to be working great.Regarding the phone itself (S20 Ultra versus my old S9): FAST - by far what I'm happiest about. My old phone was really dragging in responsiveness. Front (selfie) camera noticeably WAY better. Rear camera - I'm sure is better, but I expected to notice a huge difference and other than the fact that I can zoom in a lot more, the quality when I zoom in isn't just over the moon better than my old phone (ie, on 8x zoom, photos from the 2 phones look similar). But I will say, the ""live focus"" that resembles the ""portrait mode"" of an iPhone makes me excited. Plus there's other nice features, like zooming out (wide view), etc. Overall happy with this. NEGATIVES..... my only complaint that I hope doesn't ruin my experience with this phone is the FINGERPRINT READER. The actual reader on the back of the S9 was seemingly perfect. I LOVED it - almost never had issues. Why, WHY?! did they go to a digital one. It seems to work fine without a case or screen protector. I've tried a few cases thus far that all claim to work well with the reader but NO. With case on, it works like 25% of the time (followed all the directions). And honestly, I'm not sure I blame the cases - seems like everyone is having issues with this. I'm ordering some screen protectors that have decent reviews and *fingers crossed*. Oh, also, this phone is big, like huge. I think (hope) I'll get used to it, but wow. Samsung, please review the size of female pockets before designing your next phone."
4786,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,I Love the phone but it didn't come with the accessories that were stated. I only received an ejection pin and a brief leaflet.
4787,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,it's a great phone. definitely an upgrade from what I previously had. Camera does have moments where it takes a minute to auto focus. overall I'm pleased with the purchase.
4788,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,Fast delivery very nice and clean looks brand new.
4789,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,I was a bit skeptical about buying a refurbished phone. But I received this today and it looks brand new! There are absolutely no issues with the screen or body. This if a fantastic find and a super deal!
4790,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,It good. I am satisfied.
4791,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"Only one day one.. But came im perfect like new condition. Charger and cord in box. Battery seems to be strong. No scratches, no scuffs.. No complaints!"
4792,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"I bought this refurbished. And I think it was refurbished because the camera is not very good. I am a photographer. So I know how to adjust features in order to get a crisp clear picture. I bought this because it was touted as the single best phone camera on the market. My Samsung Galaxy Note 8 took incredible pictures. The detail and crispness was, bar none, the clearest I've ever seen on a phone.Other than that, it functions normally, as every other Android phone on the market.Bummed. Because, I always buy refurbished and have never had an issue before. And I had very high expectations for this camera."
4793,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"Works as it's supposed to and is actually a 5G enabled device. Even though it has a hint of the scent of a sweaty yt person, I will buy again."
4794,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,I am returning this phone because battery has a short life and doesn't charge in super fast mode along with that I noticed that the camera doesn't focus very well. Hopefully I'll get another S20 phone without these issues.
4795,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"I bought my Galaxy note 9, 6'4 refurbished & LOVED my phone. I only upgraded to the S20 Ultra because it was a larger phone. My issue w/this Refurbished phone is the size stated 6'9. I don't really see much of a size difference & people seems to be having a hard time Hearing me, like it's been dropped in water or something? I really could have saved my monies & kept my note 9!!"
4796,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,This was a great find. Phone came clean. Been using it a few days everything works great.
4797,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"I upgrade every 4-6 years. Went from S1, S5, S9+, and now S20 Ultra. I hated the curved screen edges on the S9, it made it more vulnerable to cracking and protective screens didn't set very well. With S20 the screen is only slightly curved and I'm happy to say I was able to place the screen protector on with the first try. Another big improvement is the amount of ram. 12gb is a good amount especially for a phone so I'm never worried about the phone slowing down. The only criticism I have is the battery. It seems to drain faster than a new phone should. The phone also gets extremely hot during recharge. I'm not smelling any burned plastic or anything but it's definitely hotter than it should be I believe. I'll watch it for now to make sure it.doesnt burst into flames and hopefully this is just a non issue."
4798,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,Good picture quality. Good phone. Came on time. Need charging each day!
4799,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"I used to be an iPhone user, but I couldn't pass up this almost-new Samsung S 20 Ultra in Amazon's Renewal program with a 90-return policy to boot.Jeff E."
4800,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,Only wear I could see was on the metal ring around the camera. Everything else was great.
4801,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"My dislike from the jump is the product didn't match the description. The description said Galaxy s20 black fully unlocked. I received a gray Galaxy s20 ultra that was Verizon Branded. Whoever unlock this device, you can still tell that there's a shadow of what the interface looked like with the Verizon software visible on the screen. I don't know if Amazon has now changed their expectation of what renewed is. I've bought devices around the same price as I paid for this one and this device looked pretty mangled up. The camera had a crack on the back lens and I mean a cat scratch crack. The phone looked like it had some kind of film on the back of the phone. Something that could have been buffed up and cleaned off. Overall, it just looked pretty shabby. This isn't to diss the seller. Overall quality. I'll give this phone a three and a two and a half rating. I don't like going through the process of trying to return devices. I told myself if the phone works on my network I would use it but in the long run this has taught me to think twice now about purchasing renewed products from Amazon."
4802,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,no more bixby
4803,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,I haven't bought a Samsung phone in years.  My wife convinced me it was time.  The SD card slot was the main reason but I'm really happy with this phone.  It's less than half the cost of the s22 ultra.  The camera and screen are amazing.  Zero issues with my refurbished one.  I LOVE THIS PHONE!!
4804,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"Product arrived fast and as advertised. Looks like new, no scratches and seller returns messages instantly. Will definitely come back for more when i need to upgrade."
4805,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"I am pleased overall with the phone which I primarily purchased for the camera as I am an art student and will find it beneficial. However, it is on the large size so can be awkward to hold at times and being glass you will definitely want to buy a case to protect it. I haven't had any issue with battery life and the screen quality is excellent."
4806,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,I love it. I love it More than expected so far
4807,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"This phone arrived in perfect shape, charger sucked but phone was in excellent condition. Phone works as it should except the battery seems to not last long so I am thinking it was replaced with a cheaper one or just faulty. I was able to activate the phone, HOWEVER it is still locked with Verizon. When I start the phone it says Verizon, I get an error saying sim card is not a Verizon aim card, also a lot of Verizon apps which I cannot remove. I am going to keep the phone for a few days to determine if I will return but not looking good based off of battery life and being locked to Verizon. I contacted the seller and they were not helpful. They apologized and said to return however did not offer a solution to send another phone. They did not care."
4808,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"Bought Amazon used but looks new, had several weeks now and no issues."
4809,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,This product was awesome.  I ordered the wrong phone e and didn't have a problem with the return.  Thank you seller.
4810,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"I only gave this device 4 stars because of the charger that it came with, I was a bit skeptical with ordering a renewed item because I'm living in the Caribbean and there is no way for me to return this item, but to my surprise the device came in near to flawless condition, no scratches, no dents no scuffs nothing, the charger was cheap and slow seems like an old blackberry adapter, but all in all I am very happy with my purchase, will order again."
4811,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"Needed a personal phone and decided to go for an Amazon renewed one, boy I'm glad I did! It came just like described and with so many scams on the internet, I was Leary but rest assured once I powered it up with my Sym card. Everything worked perfectly, so much so that I bought another one."
4812,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,fast shippingï¼Œbut there is a black dot on the phone screenï¼ŒI need to replace.
4813,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,I honestly dont know what to right but i haven't had any problems with it
4814,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,Fastest Shipping and brand-new phone. I am more than happy
4815,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,The phone is in a great condition but didnot come with akg usb headphones like it said only comes with the charger and usb cable.
4816,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"The phone arrived on time and looked like New. I have not tested the fingerprint reader etc. I was not impressed by the battery life...not that it is bad but you need to recharge after about 5 hours of minimal use. Screen quality, fluidity, and smoothness is what we have come to expect from Samsung Galaxy products... Overall, I am pleased with the phone. I haven't had the time to try out all the bells and whistles...I am impressed with the Amazon renewed. As it is, I am not sure I will ever go back to buying full-price ""new"" phones again. Lol. I bought mine from Seller StahrrRenewed (fulfilled by Amazon), and it came with a charger, charging cable, and a wired headphone. The wired headphone is a surprise because it was not promised in the product details. Thank you StahrrRenewed! I will be patronising you again."
4817,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"Nothing to complain about . Looks great , works great , good price !!!!!!"
4818,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"Exactly as described in description, best phone I've ever had. It's faster than my 2 year old computer with the 5g. Thanks for the amazing phone."
4819,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,This phone (s20 Ultra) was an upgrade from my pervious s9 plus. The only downside i had in the beginning was the price on this phone brand new. Then i came to amazon to look for one renewed and i found one! This phone was in great shape! No scratches or dents. The phone works and looks exactly like new with a low price tag when compared to brand new. The 90. Day money back policy is what mainly sold me since i knew if i didn't like it for any reason i could send it back and get my money back or a replacement. When i go to upgrade again i will be using amazon for renewed again!
4820,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"This phone arrived in excellent, like new condition. Transferred all data from same model with broken screen. Very satisfied with my purchase."
4821,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,5/5 works as intended. Thankfully working with atnt.
4822,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,I loved that it still was in great condition. I loved the camera. I did not like that I couldn't hear on the phone. I had to put it on speaker phone to hear anyone.
4823,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"Received my phone sooner than expected. It does have light scratches ( very few) on the glass. But other than that no issues. Also received a factory fast charger, i was super surprised, it works great. Customer service with this seller is amazing.The phone itself works great ( s20 Ultra) the display looks amazing. Im coming from a pixel 2xl so this is a big upgrade for me. Set the phone up in no time, put my SIM card in and within minuites I was able to make calls with no issues. Im on the verizon network and we had zero issues. I would recommend to friends and family. I saved myself alot of money buying this way instead of instore.Overall, awesome customer service with the seller, the phone is in great conditions, would recommend to friends and family. Verizon network."
4824,SAMSUNG,Galaxy S20 Ultra,128 GB,Android,6.9 Inches,"Listen... so I bought this right thinking I was saving money... WRONG! DO NOT BUY! Just go to Samsung website and buy with a installments or something. I understand buying your phone outright lifestyle. Trust me... I've nvr done anything BUT. However, I got this phone and since the day i received it and opened it it restarted itself randomly constantly all day every day for MONTHS!!! Middle of call, middle of video, middle of text while in sleeping, middle of game, scrolling through an app, anything. Even someone right after it just restarted it would happen again. I had the phone for like five to six months. Maybe longer. I more so live pay check to pay check so hence why I was looking for a discounted place to buy it. I took it to two shops and ""U break I fix"" said to just return it and have them try again. I tried using the warranty thing I bought with it on the first week or so and they were absolutely no help. I eventually took it to a local place and they told me it would need a new motherboard ordered from Samsung... basically a brand new phone with just the same body... -.- In the end I used Samsung trade in program and basically THAT was my way of getting this phone for about $500 to $600 in total if you do the math. If you have the time to deal with all the waiting and the whole process then I guess you could buy this just to turn it into the trade in program they have to get an actually working one for a discounted price, but if you do not have a backup phone then you will be phoneless for a minute... Not optimal in today's world. Long story short... DONT BUY THIS EVER!"
4825,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,Works great while travelling across the USA and the Caribbean
4826,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"To be honest with you I don't have any dislike to say about this phone the battery life is amazing I would charge my phone night before. in the morning until next morning  and it will still have a lot battery life also camera it amazing also so clear when I take any picture  it look so clean and look so life like .the charger fast charger only take 2 hours to fully charge my phone you will not need charge  your phone as  much.  for next 18 to 22 hours I love the car charge also great only thing it didn't come with was a memory card,ear piece and case for the phone but over all I give this phone it self 4.9 of 5 for the phone but most part with out case,memory card or ear piece.the storage it excellent have 128gm the screen is great for watching movie also the phone it pretty strong but it 4 ram not 5 ram as it say in the description I got it on sale but if you looking for good affordable phone this is for  you. One thing I can say I don't like with this phone when got  Bluetooth ear piece it will connect or play Tru the ear piece when u try to listen any videos on YouTube but other than that it real good phone"
4827,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,I paid a bit over other places. It arrived. I kept it. Not the best price and the phone is outdated  UT good enough for my purposes
4828,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I bought a Motorola G Power and it was the worst phone I have ever purchased. Decided to send it back, which was easy because I bought it here on Amazon. Replaced it with this model, and it was like night and day. Better screen, much quicker, better speakers, better camera, NFC capability (Motorola is still making phones without tap-to-pay!), slightly smaller size that fits my hand much better, great battery life. It's not a luxury phone, but for $235 I'm very happy. Also, the blue is pretty. : )"
4829,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"Been using it a while.  Good overall phone.  Decent camera.  Battery lasts less than a day even in battery saving mode.  Occasionally locks up for a little bit.  I guess it was worth the money, but the short battery life is annoying."
4830,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"Nice screen, big lasting battery for a whole day, nice crystal looks on the back"
4831,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I was skeptical when I bought this phone, because it seemed too cheap at $309. I figured I must be missing something.But this A32 is perfect. The camera is super, the screen is crystal clear, and battery life is great. Reception is as good as any phone in the household, and there's not a single feature that I miss. I know my  other ($650) phone must be superior, but I haven't figured out how.I'm using the phone with an AT&T SIM in slot 1, and a Telcel SIM (from Mexico) in slot two. Occasionally, I'll use a T-Mobile SIM in slot two, which also works well. The phone has two ""real"" SIMs, rather than eSIMs, which gives you added carrier flexibility.The phone is 4G VoLTE, dual standby, with both SIMs always active.Samsung is promising two Android OS upgrades, which is great if they deliver. The phone comes with Android 11, the latest at the time of purchase (9/21).Be advised that while the Samsung A32 is on AT&T's list for working after their 3G shutdown (February 2022), this particular model number is NOT on AT&T's list at this time. The phone's technology is compatible, but AT&T is trying to force the unblocked phones off their system.I think they're bluffing, and that after all the pressure (sales calls, etc), this phone will work on AT&T. But in case I'm wrong, I've taken the phone to T-Mobile, who's confirmed that it will work on their system after 3G shutdown."
4832,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,I've had the phone for two months and I love the color. I love that it is fast and works well. I went from a 6.5 inch phone to this 6.4 inch screen and there is a big difference. The words on the screen are a lot smaller but I am used to it by now. I just wish the screen was wider. Overall it is a good buy.
4833,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,Muy bueno pero lo devolvÃ­ sin necesidad de usar.
4834,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"No estÃ¡ mal si eres un usuario que no requiere de una potencia extrema y por lo que he usado los 90 hz de pantalla es puro marketing ya que al usarlo el celular va con lag en muchas transiciones como desbloquear el celular, abrir aplicaciÃ³n etc."
4835,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"This phone is incredible for a mid range budget phone. Very good camera quality and battery life. Finger print sensor could be a little faster. Overall, a good phone."
4836,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"Everything about this phone is right. It's got a big screen, good camera, plenty of features...got it up and running in a few minutes. I got my SIM card from Mint which uses the T-Mobile network. You can use this phone with At&T and TMobile because they run on GSM technology. You can't use this phone if you have Verizon or Sprint because they use CDMA technology. And because Mint does not have any brick and mortar stores their rates are 50% cheaper than everyone else's and they have great service."
4837,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"Included manual for this phone comes in various languages, but not English."
4838,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"Awesome product at an appreciated price.  It takes great photos. However, it did not come with a car charger as described.  It has a travel adaptor that does not work in the USA.  Thankfully, Amazon quickly took care of the charger issue"
4839,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"So i bought this phone and it will not stay connected on phone calls. Its not even a north American phone, as it comes with a European adapter. If if works I wouldn't care but its doesn't. The signal is erratic in places ive had zero issues. Ive worked at the same location for almost a decade. Never dropped a single call, same service provider, multiple phones, zero issues. Their phone wont hold a phone call longer than 5 mins. Tried explaining all i wanted is a new phone that works. Sent the broken one back, with a request for replacement. They tell me that the phone is scratched and they are taking half of the cost of the broken phone, because they cant resell it with the scratch on it. Also that my reports of the phone not working isnt correct because they can turn the phone on and it boots up. It dont even make sense for me to go without a phone for weeks, just to replace it with the same phone, for no reason. If the phone works why do i want another one of the same exact type. They will not answer messasges. THIS IS A SHADY COMPANT SELLING PHONES NOT EVEN FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN MARKET! WHEN THEY DONT WORK THEY WILL TAKE HALF YOUR MONEY WHEN YOU TRY AND RETURN IT."
4840,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"if I knew that before I purchased this I wouldn't have bothered in the first place.BUT if you are okay with a 3g phone, then this is an alright choice."
4841,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,This phone does not work in the US. ATT refused to register it on the network. I was busy and did not go to ATT right away - now I am stuck with it because they refuse to accept the return because it is outside of the 30-day return window. I guess the end is near for amazon after Jeff got busy with his new girlfriend.
4842,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,I love everything about this phone
4843,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"Do not buy! This phone is NOT for the US!!! Yes, it's unlocked and it will sort of work but we were having all kinds of problems with it, most calls were not going through at all. After lots of time on the phone with t-mobile finally took it to one of their locations and their employee explained to us that this phone is for Europe and Asia so it'll never work right with US networks.It was a major headache for almost 2 months! Thankfully, Amazon still refunded the money!"
4844,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"Bought this A32 4G when I needed to upgrade to 5G and was assured that a 4G would work with 5G technology. With that being said and the right price range, I bought it.  It worked ok for a while and then little things started to happen like it wouldn't turn on every so often.  When 5G actually came 6 months later it was completely useless and I had to buy a new phone."
4845,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"While the design and build is great, my biggest issue with the phone is how SLOW it is. Navigating through the phone and making calls is noticably slow. Not sure if its 4GB Ram is to blame or what. But that's been my experience."
4846,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"For under $300, this phone is excellent value for your money. Unlike the Google pixel 4a, the Samsung a32 4g comes with Android 11 out of the box, includes 128 gb, and Samsung includes 3 years of software and security upgrades.Great screen image, built with quality hardware, and has a ton of great features to customize your phone to your liking. You won't find a better phone at this price."
4847,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,I think it's great that the phone has features such as the facial recognition and fingerprint scan!
4848,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,Long story short this phone has not been whitelisted on AT&T's network (or any of those who use it such as Cricket) and my account was immediately suspended when I put the sim card in the phone.  It is not clear why since the phone is certainly capable of supporting VOLTE calling.
4849,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I've had this phone for some months now and haven't had any complaints other than I could never get 4G/5G. I only get LTE/3G/2G. I thought all along that this was because I have metroPCS and that maybe that was why. Today I've ran my IMEI through multiple carriers like Verizon, AT&T, and Cricket for all of them to deny my device unlock due to the fact that 3G is going to be virtually obsolete by next year... I feel like I got the short end of the stick here. Now I have to buy another phone. Not too happy about it."
4850,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"Open the specs on this listing and you'll see ""Cellular Technology: 4G.""  Perfect - that's what I wanted.  Phone works great; all good.  Love my little A32.Fast forward three months; I get a notice from AT&T that my phone will no longer be supported - I need to get a 4G or better device.  I take my phone into an AT&T store, the tech looks at it and says: where did you get this?  I've never seen anything like it.  It's a A32 that only supports 3G.  I didn't know anyone even made these.As we all should know by now, US carriers are phasing out 3G networks.  And sure enough, AT&T dropped my phone off the network.  As of yesterday, my ""new"" phone is nothing but a camera.  No calls, no data, no SMS.  You can bet I'm upset and will be opening a case with Amazon.Buyer beware."
4851,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,disappointed. A 5g phone very slow processor
4852,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,The screen is beautiful!  The battery lasts! The operating system takes getting used to from Android 6.  Cases for the 4G phone are hard to find - everyone wants to sell the 5G phone case which does NOT fit. Very pleased with the phone.
4853,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"Awesome phone, exactly like in description. A great Samsung , great price, works well, everything functional .. absolutely nothing to complain about.Delivery was faster than initially said."
4854,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"Case is attractive and easy to attach, but makes the phone much to heavy."
4855,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,Good price
4856,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"The worst experience with a phone. After confirming directly with the buyer it would connect with 4G in the states and could take ATT, the phone came with a paper saying the complete opposite. But, taking the companies word, I sat in ATT store for 3 hours while the ATT guy tried to make the phone work. It would never connect to a network. He even called his manager, tech support, etc to help.I returned it promptly and bought a similar phone at the ATT store for cheaper than what this phone was for on sale.What a waste of time and effort! Negative stars."
4857,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"Excellent phone. Fingerprint sensor works with screen protector if you press down firmly. Might help to add the same finger twice so its less likely to fail scanning it. Colors are great, battery is beefy, the back has a nice metallic look and the camera is pretty good. I think it was worth the money"
4858,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I returned the item over a month ago and I still have not gotten my refund back. First of all the sellers are sketchy, my phone said that it came from Mexico and had Spanish writing instead of English. It came with a European plug, no converter to the American plugs. The phone screen didnâ€™t work properly. And it didnâ€™t work with Verizon which at the time none of the writing in the page said so."
4859,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,I did a lot of research before I bought this phone. This is the best phone sub-$300 in 2021. A really great mid-ranger that does not break the bank.
4860,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,This phone works great. I can tell that the extra storage helps me run all the apps I want. The battery is rarely below 50% by the end of the day. I like the fingerprint reader. This was a good upgrade phone without having to spend $800.
4861,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"Update: this phone's screen started glitching on me every time I used it every min or 2 it was in use. I contacted the seller and all I got was ""it's past the 30 day return period, contact Samsung or a 3rd party repair shop."" Smh, I'd understand if I had it for awhile but after only 6 months and spending $350 on it and now having to go buy a new phone for $300, I'm very disappointed.It's not a 4G phone. Other than that I like the phone. Was able to hook it up with my Metro by T-Mobile service. The UI is fast and has a nice camera. Just wish it was 4G. It's not too big of a deal tho because I'm always home and have WiFi but still for the price I'd prefer it to be 4G."
4862,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,Se calienta demasiado y muy rapido ğŸ˜‘
4863,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,Phone is not advertised correctly. Will not work with T-Mobile/ Sprint.
4864,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I really do love this phone. Tons of memory, too. I added a 1TB SD card to back up pictures, downloads and videos. So far the phone runs smoothly!"
4865,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,The phone is great. I needed a new phone as an emergency but I think I will keep it for a good while since it works wonderfully.
4866,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,After reading the description I bought the phone thinking it would be a great substitute for my previous phone. The compatibility claim is false. After going to the verizon website to switch from my old device to the A32 it says it is not compatible. PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF THE HASSLE AND DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!
4867,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I bought this phone about 9 months ago. Battery life is great. Camera is slow and if there is any movement at all in the photo, the image ends up being blurry. For about a month, the phone will randomly start glitching. Like part of the screen is sensing touch, but I'm not touching it at all. It has gotten worse, and the only way to make it stop is by force restarting the phone. Really annoying and it's happening multiple times a day now. Don't buy this phone. Save your time and money and buy something better that will last more than a year."
4868,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,This is a great mid-range prices phone. The camera makes clear crisp pictures. Easy to use. The Samsung quality shows.
4869,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"I bought this phone for my mom. She uses straight talk, but after calling several times she still could not get her phone activated. When we took a closer look at the box, we noticed it doesn't quite look like the box on Samsung's website. Also, the phone is a little shorter than the proper phone."
4870,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,Horrible phone it was in Spanish and had a Korean book not at all was in the description horrible by a very disappointed
4871,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,"It was my first time buying a Samsung. I was so excited as I heard great things but I should have done more research on the A series. I had to return because texting was basically impossible, Bluetooth connection was awful, and screen glitched out on me everyday causing me to hard reset all the time. Other than that it's a beautiful phone. So sad. Got an S series this time which I'm reading is their flagship phones so I hope I don't have these issues anymore."
4872,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,I have no negative feedback. (*Â¥*)
4873,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,So far the phone seems to be as advertised.
4874,SAMSUNG,Galaxy A32,128 GB,Android 11,6.4 Inches,Got this phone for my mom and it doesn't work with cricket. Wish I would known that before I purchased the phone. The 5g version is the only version of this phone that'll work with it.
4875,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"Over the years I have found that buying a budget-friendly phone has served me well. The design and features are comparable to their more expensive counterparts and you could easily upgrade every year and still save money. The Umidigi A 11 Pro Max is my latest purchase and this phone has surpassed my expectations. The specs are amazing. I have the 8 Gb and 128 Gb edition and have found that it is powerful enough for all my needs, mainly streaming and a few low-intensity games. I am certain that with these specs this phone could satisfy the majority of users. I love the phone's design, a combination of metal glass and plastic that has a nice solid feel in your hand. I opted for the Mist Blue and I love this color. Some people have objected to the ""Beyond Dreams"" slogan on the back of the phone but I think it looks cool! I have been using this phone now for more than a week and have been pleased with the features. I love the fact that the A 11 Pro has a 3.5mm audio jack to work with my earphones and an old car stereo. FM works great with the earphones. I also used the additional storage to add my music files to the phone, though there is ample onboard storage. I have been using the side fingerprint unlocker with success but I cannot speak to the face recognition feature because I do not wish to use it. Connectivity is awesome! Many phones I have owned only had one or two working 4g bands but this phone runs the gamut easily connecting wherever I go. This is also the first phone I have owned that supports wifi calling-a nice feature. Bluetooth has connected easily to my comparable devices. The thermometer seems accurate, though I have only used it a few times. The cameras are great, both front and back. Took superb night shots. 1080P video streaming. But the feature I love the most is the battery and more importantly the battery life. The A 11 Pro max has a 5150mAh capacity battery and I can easily get two days of usage on a full charge! The charger is not the fastest I have had but with the extended life of the battery, it is not as important a feature as with other phones.Overall I give this Umidigi A 11 Pro a 4.5 out of 5 stars. A faster charger stereo speakers and NFC  would have been nice but this is a feature-full phone at a nice price point! I would definitely recommend this phone for any budget conscience buyer."
4876,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"                    The media could not be loaded.
                



Â Construction-wise, the phone feels solid.  This means both well-made and kind of heavy.  The sides remind me of an iPhone 5S except that this Umidigi's heft is due in large part to the huge battery contained inside.  The phone comes with a USB-C charging cable, charging brick, plastic case, and pre-installed plastic screen protector, the standard accompaniments for Umidigi phones.  The power button does not stick out like it does in some phones so there is little risk that you turn your phone or screen off or on when you adjust your grip or when the phone is in your pocket.The current Android 11 operating system takes up 14 of the 128 GB of ROM in the phone.  After getting the phone set up and downloading the same 120 apps that I have on my 64 GB Umidigi F1 Play, I had 99 GB free, a lot of space so maybe I will not bother with an SD card, for now at least.  4 GB of RAM is definitely enough for me and the processor is decently fast with only a little stutter here and there when scrolling down web pages or switching between apps.  I found the display is bright and easy to read at 40% or so in all but bright sunlight, when I needed to turn the brightness to the maximum to see what was on the screen.  Battery life is incredible.  I am not a heavy user.  I typically make several calls and spend four or so hours browsing the web and watching YouTube videos on my phone.  I got nearly 3 days of this usage from a full charge.The LTE signal on Mint Mobile was good, comparable to the reception on my iPhone.  No 5G, but I knew that this phone was LTE so that is not a disappointment.  Wifi seems reliable.Other reviews might be better regarding the camera since I tend to take only outdoor and food pictures.  Outdoor daytime shots were nice, as expected.  But just about any smartphone will deliver pretty good daytime shots.  Inside and in dim light, the exposure gets cranked up quite a bit (see the cotton swabs and Halloween mug shots).  Close up shots (like the battery and USB-C adapter) came out well but it took a few efforts at focusing before a picture could be taken.For my usage pattern, this phone works really well and I am really glad to have purchased it.  My only regret is not getting the 8 GB RAM model since I might be able to use the extra RAM down the line."
4877,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"Handles nicely all of my needs for a SmartPhone easily and smoothly.You're not going to send text faster or make richer content phone calls just because your phone costs $1,200! ğŸ˜‰Working with Files and Video, browsing, even modest gaming are handled easily.The only strange thing is having a built in thermometer sensor in lieu of an NFC sensor. I don't think the thermometer is as useful, though interesting.A11 feels good in the hand and feels quite solid with great screen real-estate."
4878,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"I've been using the phone for a little over a week now, which is standard for me before I submit my reviews.This gives me a little time to dig into the product and get past the initial WOW factor.And here we are, and I'm still digging this phone.Battery life is more than enough to power through a full day of use, I usually end the day with around 20% left. Not too shabby.This is not a small phone, nor is it bulky or hard to handle. The blue finish on the back is absolutely gorgeous and well done.The screen is clear and bright, text is very readable and colors pop. This is definitely 'media consumption' friendly.Camera array works well, especially at this price point. Add in the temperature sensor, which at first I thought was gimmicky, but is actually more accurate then I expected. Much easier than trying to scrounge around for the thermometer that is always lost in a drawer.There is a 2MP macro lens and a 16MP ultra wide lens along with the 48MP main camera.There is a user programmable button on the left side of the phone, which is implemented very well. I currently have it set for single press turns on the flashlight and long press opens the temperature sensor. Extremely handy.The power button on the right side does double duty as the fingerprint reader and work as well as any FPS I've used on other phones.The MediaTek G80 processor performs much better than I expected, is it as fast as a flagship phone? No. Does it offer stutter free performance during everyday use? Absolutely.Almost forgot to mention that it supports two sims plus an SD card at the same time - 3 separate slots, not two.And hey, it has a feature that flagship phones have abandoned in search of higher profits through peripheral sales - a headphone jack!There is one feature that I feel is missing, and that's support for NFC so that I could use it for contactless payments, but that's not a deal breaker at this price point.Umidigi invested their money in design and features that would exceed the price they are charging for this phone. It really is an overachiever.Again, Umidigi built a inexpensive mid-range phone with little features that will surprise and is a purchase that you will not regret."
4879,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"My main issue is that it claimed to work with my carrier but it didnt. Other than that, i love the speed and video quality it has as a gaming/entertainment device."
4880,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"I had a A9 Pro which bricked on an over the air update. I was traveling at the time and really needed a phone so I purchased the A11 Pro. Dealing with UMIDIGI I get the  impression that they are strictly hardware, very little software expertise.Out of the box, camera picture quality is horrible, specs say otherwise but all photos have a washed out appearance, no settings to adjust picture quality like exposure, white balance or iso. Once I opened the 'pro' mode and adjusted some of the settings this seemed to correct the automatic picture mode once done.Screen casting did not work out of the box, have multiple devices which operate fine with my TV. The A11 Pro will not initially connect. Multiple  enable/disable setting changes, forget/add new screen to cast to it finally started working.Future updates might fix the problems above, but then you might end up with a bricked phone and UMIDIGI trying to sell you an upgrade for the latest model."
4881,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,I have had the phone for a bit over a week.  It is working well.  Nice looking screen.  Processor has kept up with all tasks I have asked of it.  SD memory card install was easy.  Having the 2 SIM card slots is great.  My only concern is I cannot find a case that will really protect the phone.  I am afraid I will drop the phone and that will be the end of it.  This phone replaced a Moto Z4 and works at least as well for $130 less.Update July 31:.  Microphone does not pick up well for videos.  I can barely hear on playback.
4882,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"I bought this phone hoping it would work on the Boost Mobile Network... unfortunately it does not. That said, this is not the point of this review. This phone is amazing. I had it for almost 2 weeks trying to get it to work on Boost, during that time I seriously tested this thing out. I bought the 8gb version and I had zero lag or issues with anything that I asked it to do. Heavy graphic games (CODM) worked beautifully. I made a point to run as many things at once as I could, zero issues. If you're looking for an amazing high-end phone for less than half the price, this should definately be it.Lastly, just to say - I saw a few negative reviews on here about their customer service and I had a completely amazing experience with them. Super prompt to reply and they went over the top to try and help me out. Long story short, if Boost Mobile ever whitelisted UMIDIGI phones I would be an UMIDIGI customer for life. Just to drive this point home - this is the first review I've ever made on Amazon and I felt compelled to do so because the quality of their phones and customer service is truly top notch."
4883,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"its a very good phone and has lots of great features.Unfortunately my device shuts off frequently by itself, Even  with the flashing of the phone it still shuts off by itself.  The flash fix that the technicians or the support persons sent and suggested sent did not fix the issues with the phone.UPDATE: customer service from this company reached and was very persistent in making things right, which I really appreciated. At the very least, they stand by their product and want to ensure customer satisfaction. I am not able to return the phone because of where I am and so they have offered another solution. This solution I am pleased with."
4884,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"While I didn't really expect software updates, I would have thought you would at least manage security updates, but... not a one! Last security update on my phone says June 2021, which is 7 months before I purchased it. Do better Umidigi."
4885,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"I originally gave this phone 1 star as there were some problems with it. Having owned a umidigi F1 smart phone in the past which was great bang-for-your-buck phone. And comparing it to always having one phone in our family being a current Samsung flagship phone. I thought it would be the same for this phone, but for some problems that I was experiencing in what seem like a solid phone. Umidigi is reaching out as of the time I'm updating this comment assuring me it is an anomaly on this particular phone I received.I do know this kind of stuff happens so will wait to see if customer service resolves the problem adequately or not. So, this review may go up or down, but I do appreciate them reaching out and caring this says something about company's concern about customer's experience with their products."
4886,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"This is a HUGE phone. I can't understate how big this phone is.It is a pretty phone too, but I'd wish they didn't go for the iPhone hard edges.Works well on T-Mobile. Has nearly all bands.Battery Solid, usually 8 hrs screen-on-time per charge.Fingerprint scanner is pretty good.Camera is good hardware, but poor software. I recommend using 3rd party applications for a better camera experience.The phone runs smoothly in most circumstances, but there are occasions which it does stutter.I overall recommend this phone, but I've seen this at a better price elsewhere.If you can find this for around 200 dollars or less, it is a good value."
4887,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"**UPDATE: June 10 2022**So, this is my latest update. Imagine my surprise when a rep by the name of Vicky.L from Umidigi reached out to me. I'm guessing I was bit surprised since I did not think this was going to happen and I would have been stuck with a phone that was encountering system issues. They offered to either refund me or send the phone back to sort the issue out. I gave them 5 stars because it was a win-win for me that the company went out of their way to ensure that I was fully satisfied (Email every single day!). Due to this, I will most definitely now consider buying their products due to their excellent customer service!"
4888,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,I'm disappointed that the phone wasn't able to connect to two of my Sony Bluetooth speakers and yet it comes with a 48mp camera made by Sony. It had no problems connecting to older Bluetooth that no way near as good as the Sony's. So close!
4889,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"The main reason why i wanted this phone was for its large 6.8-inch display. I do a lot of emailing and texting when traveling and the larger screen makes typing a lot easier. The phone is physically larger than many others, of course, but it's a small price to pay for something that isn't nearly as cramped.As for the resolution, this is a full 1080p panel which is crisper than my old 720p Oppo. The higher resolution is immediately obvious given the large size of the screen. The lack of many pre-installed apps or bloatware help with the overall performance of the phone as well.Camera quality is good but could be better for up close macro shots. Battery life is good enough for a whole day of browsing, went from 100 percent to about 30 percent by the end of the day from a mix of videos and Chrome.Overall very pleased with the phone given the affordable price."
4890,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"Product arrived as indicated. Packaging was secure. Includes charger, booklet and sim car removal, clear phone case and of course the phone. Build quality is slim, has some weight on it but good feel in the hand. Comes with factory installed screen protector. Nice glass back.Cons- phone volume when listening to a call could be louder. Does not says if it's water resistant.Pros- camera, 8gb ram, phone is pretty fast. Multitasking is good. Video quality good.Well worth the price."
4891,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,Easy handle and quick responsive. First few days of using so far so great ğŸ‘

4893,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,To fancy for me.
4894,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"Nice phone, great camera. Will NOT work with Verizon or US Mobile"
4895,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"The phone runs smooth, the battery lasts long, the build quality isn't cheap,the camera takes great photos and videos and games run smoothly on this device, it's well worth the money."
4896,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"The phone has functioned well after a few months. However, the main camera (the 48mp camera) is permanently blurry and nothing will focus. Lense looks fine from the outside and all the other cameras work fine. I have to awkwardly take photos using the front facing camera and so I can't always see the picture on screen as I do it. Oh well, you get what you pay for in suppose. Shame, as the advertisement gloats about the camera quality. Buyer beware.EDIT: customer service from this company contacted me and offered an exchange or partial refund. So at least they stand by their product. Have still been using the phone and it has served me well for everything but photos."
4897,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"I was in love withthe phone when I opened it. It is gorgeous in color and everything eles.The fingerprint reader didn't work.. didn't mind that.HOWEVER, the reason I am now sending it back toAmazon is because after hardly any time at all, THE PHONE WILL NOT CHARGE. i AM HAVING TO HOLD THE PHONE AT AN ANGLE WITH THE CHARGER AND EVEN THEN IT DOES NOT WORK HALF THE TIME. iT ALSO WILL NOT GET TO FULL CHARGE. i HAD A LOT OF HOPE FOR THIS COMPANY AND PLANNED TO BUY THEIR PHONES FROM NOW ON DUE TO HOW GREAT IT SEEMED, BUT IF i CAN'T EVEN KEEP IT CHARGED..I CAN'T HAVE FAITH ENOUGH TO BUY THEM ANYMORE.Sorry for caps; eyes were closed. :)"

4900,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"UMIDIGI A11 Pro Max is a great phone when price/quality ratio is considered. It has a beautiful design with iridescent blue on the back and elegant metal on the sides that gives a good feeling in the hand, it is fast and has a mega battery. It has an offline infrared thermometer which is really a plus. Regarding the screen it has bright and sharp colors. If you buy this phone, which you should, it will not disappoint."

4904,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,It's been 3 months of having the phone. battery started not charging all the way it would only get to 80% at first and on the charger all night to only 15% now it does not charge does not turn on tried multiple of different chargers. Between no longer works or turns on with nothing wrong with the phone it's less than three months old but over there 90 days of being able to return it so don't get it.
4905,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"I bought the A11 and loved it when I first opened it and started using it. The phone randomly turns off in the middle of use and then will spend ten minutes turning off and on. It will stop in the middle of using GPS, a phone call, or doing absolutely nothing. It glitches very bad.I sent a message to UMIDIGI and was told I must send the phone back and wait for a new one in the mail. I'm a college student with a phone being my only way to navigate or talk to anyone.Terrible customer service. Don't buy :)"

4909,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,Too bad the product description is wrong regarding Verizon. This phone is AWFUL with texting.
4910,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,Was not compatible with cricket wireless kind of a bummer since my last Umidigi phone was.
4911,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,How can rate an item that failed on the first day of trial
4912,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"I Really liked the A11,we got it for our youngest! And once the A11 Pro was released I Had to Have it!! Been catching up on All my streaming, picture is Amazing and the phone moves So Fluent. Umidigi has Won Me Away!"
4913,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,It is cheap and works fast with a good camera.
4914,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"My wife has been using the Samsung A50 for about 2.5 years. It started slowing down and having issues so I was looking for something new and decided to go with the Umidigi A11 Pro Max. So far the phone has been excellent. My wife loves the size of the screen, the build-feel (sort of like the iPhone with their silver-metal rectangular look), and the long battery life. A few other perks are the dual SIM, type C port, Android 11, and the full LTE bands for T-Mobile (including bands 66 and 71). It's very hard to find anything that compares with these specs in this price range. So those are the main perks of this phone. In terms of the image quality of pictures and video, I'd say it's fairly close to the A50 --- not top of the line but not too bad either, just about average or above average. Sometimes in bright sunlight you get pictures that are a bit overexposed and in low light pictures that are more grainy than we'd like, but again, overall they photo and video quality is good. Probably the biggest negative is the size of the phone. Yes, we love the huge screen size but overall the phone is also very large (much bigger and heavier than the A50). But when we consider everything, all the pros and cons, we absolutely give this phone 5 stars and would highly recommend it. You get used to the size of it especially considering all the positives the phone offers. We're very happy with the purchase."
4915,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"Please take 5 star review with grain of salt. I am a senior citizen with very basic requirements. This is an attractive, responsive phone. The screen seems to have good resolution but it's readability in broad daylight leaves something to be desired. Texting, e-mailing, using the web, basic camera work are all handled efficiently."

Â The best phone that you should buy if you are looking for the best value for the moneyI have buy several Umidigi phones for the last 3 years,I really love the phone. The camera is great, the battery life is 2 days when using the phone every day, and the best part is that I didn't have to pay over a thousand dollars.Good camera, good battery life, thermometer and android 11. Good value. Totally recommended."
4917,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"I LOVE my UMIDIGI A11 ProMax. I've had it for 4 months. I don't use a protective case and I've dropped it 5 times and no damage. I also don't use a screen protector and not a scratch on the screen. Accidentally Dropped it/lost it in a snowbank and found it 1 hour later and it was fine. Phone feels solid, dense, and well made in your hands... especially when compared to my Moto G Stylus phones that has a plastic hollow feeling. Cameras are great and sound volume is loud. Apps load and play super fast without delay. Screen is super bright and crisp. I've owned a variety of mid priced ($200-$350) phones Motorola, BLU, SAMSUNG, LG, etc. NONE even come close to this phone. I was worried at first when I considered buying it, because I never even heard of UMIDIGI in my life. But it's worth every penny! I NEVER KNEW what it's like to own a phone that isn't full of 100 preloaded spyware/bloatware apps and games...that slow down performance and crowd your screen with icons. It doesn't work with Att/Cricket Mobile in the USA...not because it isn't a modern phone, but because it doesn't have Att & Cricket's new data collecting requirement on it. So basically this phone is safe and respects your privacy, in my opinion. I didn't know this when I bought the phone, but I loved the phone so much, that I switched Mobile carriers. It works great with T-Mobile and Mint Mobile...& perhaps other USA carriers. Also, the phone has no ""bloatware"" or permanent apps you never need or use. The temperature feature is super cool too! CONS: 1. The battery lasts only one day with heavy use, but it charges very fast. 2. The programmable button on the side of the phone is too easy to trigger, so I disabled it. For example I watch YouTube videos while on the treadmill, setting it down horizontally would trigger the button. For awhile I just made the button default to YouTube and that worked. 3. Comes with an extra long SIM card key...hold on to it, because traditional SIM keys are too short & won't work. OVERALL: It's a solid and well built value priced phone that looks sexy and performs well above expectations."
4918,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"I sadly dropped my UMIDIGI A4 Pro on concrete, and although it was a great phone it couldn't survive that kind of impact.  So, given that it was 2 1/2 years old and because it bounced, broke both sides and mangled the case, I decided to look into a replacement.  (I clumsily got out of a car near concrete steps and slipped.  Sad about the phone, glad I didn't have bodily damage)Anyway, because of my experience with that phone I went right to UMIDIGI again.  I stepped up a bit and bought this model.  I am so glad I did!First of all, a minor thing but a peeve of mine that other manufacturers seem to be doing now.  They don't give you a charger, but I am happy to say that UMIDIGI still does.  Yay!I am a biggish guy (6' 4"") with a big head and big hands.  This phone is actually ""adult sized"" perfectly for me and also has squared off sides for an easy grip!  With the included case (transparent and really nice) I don't think it will slip out of my hand and hit concrete.  The A4 had the screen right to the edges and I would often get ""false touches.""  This model is a tad shorter and eliminates that problem (thank you - I really hated that).The clear case also lets the real beauty of the back show, too!  It is an awesome matte finish (I got blue) that is stunning.  My A4 had a really shiny (almost like a mirror) finish that was disappointing.  This looks great, though I could do without the ""Beyond Dreams"" tagline (sorry UMIDIGI, it's tacky).Battery life is astounding - an added advantage from a slightly larger phone.  Generous storage at 128GB (Apple charges an extra $50 to get this sheesh) and can add an SD card for more.  It's in the same slot as the dual SIMs - nice.I just love how fast it is!  Face recognition and fingerprint are instant!  Has 8GB RAM, and everything I used was amazing (I don't play games however).  YouTube and .mkv videos I uploaded to it were perfect, and the screen is the best I have ever seen.I am not much of a ""camera head"" but this thing seems to have it all.  Best news for me is that in spite of all this stuff, it is simple enough for me to use.  I will bug my neighbor to walk me through all the options later lol.My A4 got regular updates from UMIDIGI and I expect the same here.  Got a ""minor bug fix"" right away and it went smoothly.Well, I hope that this helps others pick a phone.  While not indestructible (I tried LOL), UMIDIGI phones are beautiful, durable, have great features and a great price.  Go for it!!"
4919,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,Love the phone is unlock but it didn't work with my family mobile plan
4920,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"This is the phone you've been looking for, if you are Android user.Furthermore, even for iPhone users, this is well with considering.What it does well, is it first comes with an updated Android OS. This lets you access some of the latest that Google has to offer, especially with the Google Photos app. I know for many, this has been a consideration, especially when looking at pricier devices like the Pixel.Also, the battery is really good. It easily last hours, with all the features (Bluetooth, maps, YouTube videos, etc) enabled and utilized.Last but not least, the sound is really good, whether using the built-in speakers or wired and Bluetooth headphones.Give this a try, you would be glad you did."
4921,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"This product is great. I wanted a nice thick phone with pro max features without having to pay a $1,000 and I got just what I was looking for. :)"
4922,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"Iâ€™ve been using the Umidigi A11 Pro Max for one week and Iâ€™m posting my initial impression of this nice mid-range phone.The phone is large and premium quality. The screen size is 6.8â€ and is bright and clear. Color and contrast are good and allow wide viewing angles. Resolution is approximately 2k.The front and back are both glass and the included free case offers good overall protection for the phone. The phone also has a pre-installed screen protector â€“ which means one less thing to install and worry about.The phone has a large number of cameras and the picture quality is on par with other mid-range phones. The front is a punch-hole Sony 24mp/f1.8 camera and is perfect for selfies and video calling. On the rear you have the main Sony 48mp/f1.8 camera which has wonderful picture quality. It also offers a 16mp Ultra-Wide angle (120 FOV) lens and finally a 2mp macro camera lens.One small issue with macro camera â€“ it has a mark/dirt that is trapped under the glass which can easily be removed using editing software but still annoying.Switching between cameras is easy and icons on screen allow for rapid moving between rear cameras. I experimented with night mode and the pictures were good compared to similar costing phones but unfortunately cannot compete with the top-end phones costing 3-4x as much which, is to be expected!The processor is fast, and I experienced no lag in Android 11 or any gaming applications. Overall, everything runs at a snappy pace. With 8gb main memory and 128gb main storage, you have a lot of memory on tap for multi-tasking and storage.The phone supports both a single microSD and two Nano SIM slots which can be useful when traveling and you need to switch between SIM cards!Charging is quick and the phone features a type-C charging port and includes a fast-charging power adapter. Battery life has been amazing, after using extensively for a week, I am only now just reaching the 20% mark and will need to recharge.It features a side-mounted fingerprint & power button/sensor and Iâ€™ve had no issues with recognition and being able to register multiple fingers allows single handed unlock & power-on with left index finger.I really do like the shortcut key on the left of the device. You can configure this to launch up to 3 different applications using single, double, or long press. A very handy feature!The phone also (from my experience) a first â€“ a temperature sensor. In the age of Covid this can come in very handy for checking temperatures. I compared the readings from a dedicated device and it was almost spot on (+/- 0.1-0.3 degrees).The phone features a headphone jack (a feature missing on many mid and high-priced phones) which is a welcome addition. It also has full Bluetooth 5.0 support for the wireless headphone users.A small negative -- The phone doesnâ€™t fully support DMR and protected content (for example Netflix) can only be streamed at the lower resolution but it is difficult to tell unless you take a magnifying glass to the screen.Pros: Good price for a large number of features, great cameras, nice screen, fast performance, premium build qualityCons: DMR and Macro markI'll update review and I continue to use the phone."
4923,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"With the Umidigi A11 Pro Max the saying ""Beyond Dreams"" is true.  I was looking for a phone with storage and speed. I also wanted the bells and whistles with high mega pixel camera and speed for gaming. The features that I wanted are on flagship phones that come with prices so high. Well I came across the Umidigi A11 Pro Max. It is rich with features.The phone is large roughly 6.5 inches long and 3 inches wide. It is over 6.8 inches diagonally. The exterior is beautiful. IPS screen with a metal frame and a flat glass back. The back has the camera array with a temperature sensor.  It also has ""Beyond Dreams"" on the back glass very fitting. It is a nicely weighted phone with good balance to it. Very comfortable in the hand. The display is beautiful. Watching videos on it has been a visual experience. The screen gives a beautiful viewing experience.Game playing is also great with this phone. The processor is a Helio G80, additional the ram is 8gb nice speed. It has 128 gb of storage and can be extended to 256 with the addition of a 128gb memory card. I love this feature.I am in awe of the camera array. A Sony 48mp main camera, a 16mp wide angle and 2mp macro camera make up a great photo taking experience. There are many settings for automatic photo taking and a pro mode for selecting your own balance, white setting as well as iso. There is also a thermometer in the array for taking your temperature or the temperature of objects. This is a very cool feature.It has fast charging, but no wireless charging. There is so much more to this phone. I could write pages on it. As for now, I recommend giving it a try. I believe you will see the value and the fabulous features it has for you."
4924,UMIDIGI,A11 PRO MAX,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Feet,"Overall, this is a great affordable premium phone. It's quick, snappy, handles switching through apps with ease. All this makes it great for gaming, the phone shape and flat screen make it easy to hit screen controls, I have been using it a lot for Call of Duty with medium to high settings.I tested the A11 Pro Max on Mint Mobile (T-Mobile MVNO) and Visible (with some research and tweaks to the APN settings, it has all the bands needed)(Verizon MVNO), both worked with no issues. It has the LTE bands B1/2/3/4/5/7/8/12/13/17/18/19/20/25/26/28A/28B/B66; and B34/38/39/40/41Positives:Quick stock Android 11Fast processor for gamingScreen quality and brightness is good for gaming, social media, and photos/videosHandles multiple apps easilyFace unlock and fingerprint scanner are quickLong battery lifeThe phone itself has a very premium look and feelNegatives:The camera software wasn't the greatest in indoor/low light. It seemed to have trouble focusing the subject, so both the subject and background had a slight fuzziness/blur. It has potential to be great for mobile phone photography and social media. The selfie camera has potential with software upgrades. Nice outdoor day time photos though.The power button/fingerprint scanner is a little awkward. It's more of a flat button, level with the frame, than the volume and customizable buttons. A back or in-screen fingerprint scanner would've been better, and a regular power button."

Â I bought the UMIDIGI A7 Pro Unlocked Cell Phone (4GB+64GB) in Cosmic Black. I was very skeptical as my previous purchase of an old UMIDIGI model turned out to be a disappointment. But the A7 Pro has been a pleasant surprise. As you can see in my unboxing video, the phone comes pretty decently boxed. You open to find a ""Thank you"" note which is nice. The phone is well-protected on both sides with protective plastic film and what felt even better was it came ready with a screen protector (along with a phone case!). Under the phone, the instruction manual is nicely enveloped, clipped with a SIM tray opener and beneath is the USB - C charger. Straight out of the box, I put the phone on charge and after it reached 100% I transferred all my data from my old phone through Google in a jiffy. Updates were pretty fast and it did not drain the battery as much as I expected. I have run the phone for a day with social media, emails, browsing at full blast and I need to charge now after approx. 36 hours. Camera takes pretty good picture. Sound quality is crisp with 4G LTE VOLTE. Although the OCTA-CORE processor claims to be robust, I have to keenly observe and perhaps get back as I am not into gaming. The convenience of having dual SIM running capacity is a plus. Overall, pretty good phone for the price. Those who are thinking about giving this a try, don't hesitate. It's worth it."
4927,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"Great phone for the price.Plenty of memory, great camera and it even takes your temperature."
4928,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"Umidigi A7 ProJust received my phone. I  am extremely pleased!The packaging is pretty good the elegant case makes the unboxing pleasant.

Works really well in all conditions including bright days.Performance is really good I was able to run any application with no lag.No issues with android auto.Call quality is really good, I have at&t, no drop calls and LTE works rally good, getting 100mbps in my area.Battery life is good. This thing has a massive battery.

Sharp clear images.Price. For a budget level phone you are getting so much.Cons:Camera can use some refinement in very low light. This is normal on any camera phone.Wish there was Bluetooth 5 as I have aptx headphones.Overall the phone is fantastic and does anything a phone that cost x10 more can do. I highly recommend it!!"
4929,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"This is my second phone I've purchased from Umidigi - my F1 Play kept soldiering on after I shattered the screen by dropping it on cement about 15 times through food deliveries.I'm pleased to say that unit was still going (albeit handicapped) when I finally decided to spring for the A7 Pro.For the money you'll be hard pressed to find something comparable - I'm pleased with the power, screen brightness, and all the extras that came with the phone (attached extra screen protector and a slim form fitting case).The fingerprint reader is fast and  snappy (actually improved upon from my F1) and I really canâ€™t complain for the price.Letâ€™s get one thing straight, this phone is not a flagship killer but itâ€™s damn good for the money.I work 12 hour shifts and depend on my phone for every single delivery. Through rain and snow, drops, falls, and slams in my car door it keeps soldiering on like a reliable friend.If you need something durable, with a bright screen, great battery, and a price that wonâ€™t destroy you if it breaks, get this phone.Itâ€™s the working manâ€™s phone."

Aside from screen distortion it would randomly open apps, restart itself, or generally act possessed by an evil entity. This is absolutely a ""you get what you pay for"" phone.

I needed to have stock Android and something that was unlocked so if we needed we could test a couple of different carriers with. WiFi calling was also a must. For the price I was blown away! Build quality, features, stock Android and it will be version upgradable. My only complaint (and itâ€™s not something she would ever use it for anyways) is no NFC for Google/Android Pay, but seriously, this is a flagship killer if you are on a budget.No bloatware. It charges fast, works well, call quality, video chat (tested with Google Duo) quality, and battery life were all excellent. Awesome phone, especially if you already are an Android user."

4954,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,The battery life is HORRIBLE sucks on this phone and i JUST bought it
4955,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"I bought A7 Pro on line from official UmiDigi store. After nine months (still in warranty) the case is starting to split and edge of the swollen battery is visible. My UmiDigi A3 Pro bought end of 2018 is now completely split in two pieces by battery, but I thought the problem was my fault (got too hot, or overcharged) so I got the A7. Now I know the problems are not my fault. UmiDigi Customer Service at first said by email 'sorry for the inconvenience, do not worry' and asked for photos. I sent the photos, but now Customer Service stop responding. In the photo, totally split A3 Pro is at left and starting to split A7 Pro is at right. Beware!"

Â I got this Umidigi phone for a few reasons, one: it was a good price. Two: its not a big name brand, but is prominent enough that there is a fair amount of support out there. Three: it is factory unlocked and supports dual SIM and expandable memory! I was also pleasantly surprised when the phone arrived and I felt how premium it actually is. The frame is an aluminum alloy, the front and the back are glass, not name brand Gorilla, but still a nice and durable glass. It had a screen protector on from the factory that was decently nice, but at certain angles you could see ""waves"" and you can notice them in the video I included with this review. the fingerprint reader is in a nice position on the back like a Google Pixel, and works decently well. It's not as fast or accurate as the Galaxy S9 Plus I also have, but it works well enough that most users probably won't even notice its shortcomings. The screen is actually quite impressive for a phone at this price and actually looks equivalent or even better in some situations, compared to some of the current iPhones a lot of people use. The camera, well it's there, and it's not as bad as I expected it to be, but it's definitely far from impressive. I'd say it's about equivalent to a Galaxy S8. The flash on this phone though, WOW. The flash is actually slightly brighter than the flash on my S20 Ultra! It's not brightness adjustable like most flagship phones, but damn did it impress me anyways. The processor the phone uses is certainly not top tier and I think probably actually a bit slower than they claim; that being said, it is still very usable for texting, calling, streaming, and other basic smartphone tasks. I didn't try gaming on it because I am fairly confident it would struggle or just be too slow entirely. For the casual user though, I would say the processor is more than good enough. (I also just installed a new update this morning and so far the phone seems to actually be more responsive and overall faster). The software that you get with this phone is actually really nice because it's BARE BONES Android 10! The only thing I'm not a huge fan of in that regard, is the fact that Android thinks the phone is a Google Pixel... This isn't a problem, but it can be a frustration at times because it offers you toggles or recommended settings for things the phone doesn't even actually have. If Umidigi were to go in and re-write some of the software, just enough that it doesn't keep trying to push me to set up face-unlock (does not support face-unlock) or trying to get me to ""finish setup and customize your Pixel"", then the software would be perfect. This however is a small annoyance and in my opinion shouldn't steer you away from the phone. Overall I am actually really impressed with this phone, especially for the price. I read some sort of negative reviews of Umidigi phones prior to buying this, that pretty much complained the phones were nice quality, but the support and continuous security updates (or lack thereof) were basically a joke. I have found this to not be true so far however, with the phone having done a major update right out of the box, and then a security patch later in that first week, then another about one week ago, and then a fairly major software update this morning. If you compare that to my Galaxy S20 Ultra, that's nearly double the frequency of updates. If I had to guess, it probably won't get that kind of continued support for much further into the future, but either way, it still is plenty good for the price of the phone. Overall if you are looking for a nice Android phone to do some tweaking and messing around with, or looking for a backup device, or maybe just want a nice simple and cheap but usable phone that doesn't cost $1,500, then I would actually recommend this phone. It is one of the nicest in build quality I have ever seen for the price, the software is just good'ole Android 10, the screen is better than most iPhones, and the price is perfect."
4957,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,I am updating this review to say I am disappointed in it.  The phone was ordered in Aug 2020 and now it's Nov 2020 and the phone no longer turns on.  It turned on earlier in the day and now it's just dead. So sad.
4958,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"This phone is a tremendous value.  It has so many bells and whistles and they work too.  The finger print reader works very well and the phone is FAST.  It has the latest Android 10 system.  I very much suggest this phone for a new user or even an intermediate user because of the specs.  Great price, great service from the folks at Umidigi makes this a win win!"

Â Honest Review: for that price, the performances are outstanding. The processor is fast, it handles 84 apps with zero problems, no delay in processing, thanks also to the 8GB RAM. The cameras are good; I love the selfie camera. The color is beautiful the material feels good. Having a thermometer is a crazy reality.It works with no problems with a T Mobile virtual provider."

4969,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"Sleek-looking phone.  Pictures taken with the phone came out clean and sharp.  Playing shooter or intensive games was problematic since there was occasional frame loss and freezes during gameplay.  The battery life was typical although once it got down to 50%, it seemed to deplete at a much faster rate than the first half with idle usage throughout.  Transfering the sim card was simple and it's nice to have a second sim slot and a MicroSD storage expansion as well.  Phone calls were clear on both ends.  The general usage of the phone was crisp and responsive.  If you're looking for a nice phone on a budget and want to be able to take good quality pictures and utilize non-intensive apps without issue, this device will serve your needs.  If the intention is to play top-end or intensive mobile games, consider looking elsewhere."
4970,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"Hi I have been an Apple user for years and I got this phone to try the android world and here is what I found out-Phone build very good and it comes with case and screen protector-phone display the most, clear of any notch or black bars, it is complete display, great for videos and gaming, the colors are vivid-The design of the phone gives a nice feel to hold with semi curvy at the back and flat front- Face recognition works like charm and tried the fingerprint works very well- Camera I toke few pic it seems very decent I have to try it more and I will update my review with the results,-Phone comes with USB C charger , it does not have wireless charging featureOverall I love the phone and its very good for the price ,  I will keep playing with it and keep you updated ."
4971,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"This is not my first Umidigi phone, I bought the One Pro over a year ago and have been super happy with it but wanted to upgrade to a larger screen. That being said, I was expecting the same quality and performance as my One Pro (since I paid about the same price for it), but this A7 Pro exceeded my expectation in many ways. A few things that really surprised me with this A7 Pro are:1) Much better quality build (front and back glass)2) The screen is more vibrant and the colors really pop3) For the price, the camera is very impressive and definitely better than the One Pro4) Battery life is much more impressive (but of course the battery deteriorates overtime)That said, you still get all the other cool features such as fingerprint scanner, fast charge, dual sim, and Android 10 right out of the box. At this price point you really can't go wrong with the A7 pro!"

4973,UMIDIGI,A9 Pro,128 GB,Android 11,6.3 Feet,"I've been struggling with this phone for a week and am about to give up. 1) First off I can't seem to connect to 4G service with rogers (only 3G shows up) despite verifying APN settings. 2) For some reason the only widgets that will load on the homescreen at startup are google account related widgets (like google calendar). All third party widgets seem to be blocked from booting up (just a blank space with error message) until you manually open each app individually, and then maybe the widget will load if you're lucky. It's not a time thing either as I've waited several hours to see if the widgets would load on their own. In my case STOCard and ToDoList widgets won't load and even a simple clock widget cannot be loaded on startup.Save your frustration, buy something else, I've wasted a week and will be sending back.Update: Been a week and no response from their customer service online help system... No support for product = what should be a zero rating."

Once in a blue moon it will have a slight lag (for a split second) but this passes. I've also experienced a random restart before upon waking up the phone (don't know if it was from an update?). If you don't do serious phone gaming, but like me, watch Youtube, surf internet, stream music, text, call, take/ send photos, email....this phone does all these things extremely well. Especially for the price!!!!"

4999,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"I have been using computers since the 70s when I was in college and purchased my first IBM clone in 1992, and was using PDAs very early on.  I had one of the first Windows smart phones but got rid of it in favor of a flip phone.....why?  As a physician, I had been tied to a pager for years, and I really hated trying to do anything with such a small screen.  I never jumped on the iPhone bandwagon either.Finally, as the screen sizes have increased, I decided, ok, there are apps that I may find useful as well as the integration of my Google Calander and Contacts with my phone.But, while sure, I could spend over a grand on a new phone, it just did not seem to me to be a wise use of my money.  I had read that a lot of smartphone addict aficionados look for the latest and greatest.....or maybe they did not like the color of their new phone....so they sent it back.Rather than winding up in landfills as a lot of returned Amazon merchandise does, unfortunately, Amazon was wise enough to create their refurbished division in which various refurbishers compete for customer's business.  I thought, why not give it a try.I purchased the phone from a company named Kiss in Manhattan where I grew up.  They had a high positive rating so I picked them  My phone arrived the next day despite the fact that I did not pay for overnight shipping.  Unfortunately, as I understand it, the ripples of the COVID situation put them out of business.As for the phone, when I opened up the box, I was shocked.  In terms of appearance, there was absolutely no way I would have known it was a refurb....not a mark on it.  As far as function is concerned, I used various apps to test it, and it passed.  I have been using it since the first week of August.  My estimate of battery life remaining is upwards of 90 percent.  Of note, at Batteries and Bulbs, I can replace the battery for something like 70 dollars still putting me way ahead of the game since the phone was under 400 dollars.  Add a Microcenter 512 MicroSD card for about 50 dollars and I have a phone with 3/4 of a terabyte, far more storage than I anticipate ever using.So, why the 4 stars?The phone is very elegant looking, especially with its curved display.  As such, it would look very nice put upon a pedestal in our living room.  However, I did not find the phone in an art store.  I purchased it to use every day as my mobile phone.What is the Note 9 made of?  Simply put, it is basically glass placed over a metal frame which again is fine if you want to display it on your bookshelf, but not particularly practical.  Unless a person is downright foolish, just about everyone puts a case on it.You can forget about using one of those clear cases that let the beauty of the phone shine through.  Drop it and you are facing an expensive repair.  I was using the Unicorn Beetle Pro case with a belt clip which I never used.  The phone dropped on the stairs and the inner part of the case broke.  I was not really upset about that for the simple reason it saved the phone.Now I am trying an Outbox Defender which looks pretty robust.How about the curved display?  Yes, it looks rather elegant, but does one really need it for functionality?  The answer is absolutely not.  It only serves to make designing a screen protector problematic.As for screen protectors go, I think they are necessary and I have just resigned myself to the fact that the edge adhesives are going to wear out and to simply replace them every once and awhile.  They are not particularly expensive.We as consumers really should not put up with this nonsense.  Most of the smartphones made these days have similar designs.  They reinforce the notion of built-in obsolescence, or in actuality, built-in fragility.  Yes, technology changes very rapidly.  But, the basic technology of how these phones communicate does not.  There is absolutely no reason that we should have to get a new phone every year.  They should last far longer than that in my humble opinion.The question is how can we communicate this to the manufacturers?  We can't boycott them because they all pretty much do the same thing. It is something it think about.....just saying."
5000,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,Phone came super quick and in much better condition than I expected.

This is probably the toughest phone I've ever owned. It's sturdy and remarkable not fragile even given the vulnerabilities inherent with the size of the screen.  The first one lasted the entire term of my contract plus nearly 15 months.  If I break this one,  I'll probably get another one.  I like the size of the screen,  the stylus that recognizes cursive,  and the battery life isn't bad either.  As long as Samsung maintains this quality,  I'll never use any other brand."

5007,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"I recently broke the screen on my old Note 9, and since it costs the same price to repair the screen, I figured I'd get a new phone. I was expecting a slightly scuffed up phone that would give me some problems with setting up but no. It was BRAND NEW. Not a single scratch anywhere. Nothing on it looked even a little bit used. Although it didn't come in it's original packaging, but that doesn't really matter to me. Battery life so far has been terrific. Right now it's 6 PM and I took my phone off the charger this morning at 7 AM. I forgot my phone used to last this long! My old Note 9 I've had for 3 years drops to about 20-40% around this time of the day. The stylus and fingerprint readers have given me no issues. The audio is great. It's charging fine. The cameras are in perfect condition. I have nothing negative to say.I'm so so happy and highly recommend the seller ""thegadgetdeals"" if you're going to get a phone from Amazon renewed."
5008,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"I love Samsung products, but somehow, they missed the mark on battery life with this phone. Maybe it's overly complicated user interface and options and menus and heavy settings configuration is eating all the resources? OR maybe the screen is that crystal clear and bright that the battery is holding on for dear life?My Motorola G7 Power gets 4 days with pretty good, heavy usage. YouTube, texting, Facebook messenger, Pandora are all things I run regularly on this phone. Battery life on the Moto Power, blows all other phones I have ever had out of the water.The phone is complicated. There are soooo many options that I think a user would not need. There are menus upon menus in the setting screens...It's almost like Boot Menu on a Windows PC. Lots of stuff in here most users do not know anything about, myself included. Voice to text is hard to set up as compared to my Moto G7 as well. Seriously....also does not pick up as well as my Moto phone.Great cameras!Great color!Smooth UI!Fast processor!Headphone Jack!!!! Yes!!!!Artistic Phone- with Pen, drawing, neat artsy stuff you can do with this thing!Did I mention its overly complicated to set up all of the customizations? Especially with texts options, keyboards and trying to find one that works...so many customizable options here....learning curve is kind of high on this one, not going to lie. Also, voice to text is shit.6..5 out of 10 for me, mostly on battery life. Keep charging every night and even through out the day cause I just don't trust it will make it 24 hours."

5012,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"Phone works fine. Screen had no scratches and arrived with a tempered glass screen protector on (thankfully because I dropped it the first day while waiting on my case and amazingly finally got to witness one doing what its supposed to and only cracked the screen protector and not the phone!) Shipping was almost three whole business days later than tracking was claiming it would be the entire time up until it showed up.Came missing the s pen which was disappointing,  didn't get it until a full week later, but it was a brand new Samsung packaged s pen with the accessories which I was pleased with since those are like $60. there were major scratches that chipped all the paint off around the charging port, idk how or why they did that but I was worried whoever used to have this phone was really aggressive with their usage/care and it'd effect the functionality but other than that cosmetic flaw there's nothing wrong with the phone that I've noticed.. all the built in battery health tests pass very well.. says it had 90% of its battery capacity upon first scan. I still feel like for refurbished i paid too much for a used phone that originally was sent to me half missing and seemingly uninterested customer service but it is what it is. Im satisfied overall, I paid just under $300 after tax & it was free to switch it to my active metropcs service in one phone call, also has no boatyard which I've never actually had on a phone before I love that part!If you're considering a refurbished phone at all might as well try it and save a few hundred bucks this way bc Amazon will at least make it better if its not what you were expecting"

What I read in the negative reviews is from people who simply don't know how to set up a Droid device, so they take it to a carrier store. Guess what happens then, the carrier store realizes there's very little money to be made so they tell the customer they can't use the Amazon device. And try to sell them a new carrier branded phone. My device is basically brand new. No carrier bloatwear. No scratches dings or dents. And it works flawlessly. After about 20 updates. Which also tells me its never been assigned a carrier. And even in 2022 the Note 9 is still a great phone. And I couldn't be happier with the purchase. The shipping speed , quality of the device. Its all 9.9/10. This is a great phone. Don't miss out"
5014,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"I really don't like this phone. It is a refurb but it's janky. I knew it was going to be a problem from the first time I powered it on and it took over a minute just to come on. It was downhill from there.It had 30% battery, so I put it on to charge, but it was extremely slow. There was no samsung charge cord included. Just a generic one. So I put it on my old Samsung charger and it did, finally speed charge. Then I tried to NFT my old Note 8 to this one. It barely transferred anything and what did transfer took hours. I could have just downloaded all the apps from the store faster. It didn't transfer -any- of MY files at all. I had to download pictures and important documents I keep on my phone from my computer's cloud.  While doing all of this, it drained the battery fast. So I had to paused, recharge the phone, then continue.The S pen dies super fast (30 mins use tops) and is constantly 'disconnecting' from the phone. Every app on it whether pre-installed (and thus can't be removed) or newly installed glitches, blacks out, causes the screen to flash crazily or just plain, stops responding. I've installed, reinstalled, factory reset, done everything I can, but all to no avail. All apps still glitch out constantly. I even got locked out of my banking app and got a fraud alert from them because it froze DURING LOGIN multiple times... I'd return it immediately, but I'd be stuck without a phone while waiting for a replacement.I hate it so much I haven't bothered trying to set up anything else except fingerprint recognition to unlock it. This is the first time ever, a Samsung device has let me down. I'll never buy a refurb again. Don't bother buying this device as a refurb, it's obvious they don't actually check to see if the things WORK properly more than 'yep it installed and opened that app' but they don't mind charging you hundreds of dollars for what equates to a barely functioning paper weight.... just ridiculous. HATE IT.I will be contacting them for a refund and return envelope as soon as I can, I won't pay another dime relating to this device.I'm looking for a way to replace it soon and fast."

5016,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,Battery life the worst thing in that phone
5017,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"Ordered a Note 9 through the seller Hybrid IT. I was excited to get the phone and it was in great condition. You wouldn't have known this was refurbished in the first place. Unfortunately the part of the screen used in conjunction with the s-pen was faulty on the left side of the device. I then contacted Hybrid IT and I sent it back and they sent me a replacement. New one works perfectly!Pros- Great customer service- Speedy shipping- Pretty much brand new looking-~300 for a flagship from 3 years ago is music to my ears- Packaged quite wellCons- spen may be a clone that won't connect via Bluetooth- You play the lottery when buying refurbished, but it's a lottery you'll win everytime in the end with Hybrid IT"
5018,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,I love the Note 9 and my original was stolen. I am happy I found this deal. The seller was truthful about all the info. I love the pen & many artistical projects I make! I don't care about the ways to lock & unlock my phone. Charges fast still & has a long battery life! I'm still happy a year later!
5019,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"The phone is refurbished, the light on the screen faids in and out."
5020,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"The phone works at it should, read the sim and sounded good, camera worked good, the only thing to be aware of is that even though it says its use with minimal wear and tear the screen came pretty scratch up, other than that is ok."
5021,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"Haven't had this phone long at all and already it gives me ridiculous issues, it'll turn off on its own, the screen does this crazy black out thing that makes me reset the phone.I realize its refurbished, but crap, its crap. This was a huge purchase for me and I was excited to have a higher quality phone.Super disappointed  ğŸ˜"
5022,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"Bought this to replace Note 8 while it was having the screen replaced.  The Note series has become my go-to since it does pretty much everything a Chromebook can without the bulk.Being able to manipulate this with the pen is really handy too!In fact, this review was written on it."
5023,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"I got two phones. One did not rotate from picture to landscape (android ver 10). I sent message  via amazon and got a quick reply with some info. Info did not work and they sent me a pre-paid return label. I sent the phone back and as soon as they got it they sent another. These guys(to be PC, I mean both male and female) were super efficient.  Now please don't tell them, but I think the problem was mine. The phones came with android ver 8.1 and 9. There was only one place in settings that changed from portrait to landscape. But in android ver 10 there is a second place in the two finger push down that has portrait or auto-rotate. After the second phone stopped rotating, I went to Google again and found they mentioned the second place to check. Please do not tell them, but if they find out it was probably my problem they can tell people with a similar problem that there are two places to change rotation in version 10. mea culpa mea culpa."
5024,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,La conpra perfecta muy buen telefono note.9 el presio muy bueno no tengo nada negativo q desir lo recomiendo y esta 100% deslaquiado grasias.
5025,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"Phone is mint!!! Can tell was never used, was a bit worried about the condition of it. Took it to the Verizon store and had it activated with no probs, verified as unlocked. Phone works very nice, best deal I found on this phone, would buy again!!"
5026,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,I bought it when my samsung s8 plus went dead suddenly.I didnt want to spend more on phone but ad was already useing high end phone from samsung it was difficult for me to use a midrange phone with compromised quality.Then I saw on youtube its better to go for a old flagship model rather than buying current mid range.I searched and got this samsung note 9 option on amazon.you tube vloggers highly recommended this buying it from here. I was not sure but wanted to risk it as the price was low and there was 90 day return policy.its 1 and half month since i bought samsung note 9 (unlocked) phone.Its running super smoothly .The condition of phone wasnt bad atall.The stylus pen working excellent.Camera is awesome.Guys overall i am very satisfied.The only thing which is a little disappointing is that the protective tampered glass coverings that are available for this phone is awful .Their touch sensitivity is so bad literally you have to struggle to type a message.I just ripped it off from my phone and now its all good.
5027,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"Great deal, works great!"
5028,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,Face recognition a bit slow
5029,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"Now tell me, I live in the Caribbean, bought this phone off Amazon, had it sent to a friend's in the US, who then brought it to me. I'm psyched and excited that I'm getting a new phone, to replace the old one that completely crashed AND to continue my business.  ONLY TO FIND IT LOCKED TO VERIZON!Now, in addition to the US$200+ I have to spend another US$100 to get it unlocked IF that is even possible, because if this is not a GENUINE PRODUCT then no unlocking method would work.What did Stephanie - the TRADEMORE Rep - tell me?Return it; if it's not functioning the way I expect I'm eligible for a full refund within 90 Days.I'd very likely spend an additional US$100.00 returning this phone.BTW, the exchange rate is TT$6.78 to US$1.00, do the mindstaggering math of how much this costs.So, what do I do know . . . hope for the best.Y'all are trash for this.I'm not even sorry for saying it.PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOUR MARKETING MATCHES YOUR PRODUCT."
5030,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,It was a great buy hands down only thing is that i feel like since the phone was refurbished the screen was most likely replaced and cheap cuz it cracked with no type of pressure on it honest to god
5031,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,This is by far the best phone I've ever had and I highly recommend you get it.
5032,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"Was super uneasy about buying this because of some reviews saying they got theirs locked or scratched but was super happy I decided to make the purchase. This phone looks brand new! Not a since scratch, heck it didnâ€™t even have a single smear on it! Also came With charger. Great quality! Oh! And it arrived earlier than posted."
5033,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"The phone Works great, battery life is excellent. The one thing I can take way is inspect your device once you receive it, Take it out into direct sunlight and examine it. Don't be fooled by the words renewed nor by reviewers that say my phone was in almost brand new condition, that may not be the case with your unit. Of course I don't expect the device to be flawless but I didn't  expect the condition to be in the words of that famous kiss song(Catch Scratch Fever) On the front and back of the phone. I was going to the return the phone but I lost the Bluetooth SPen, went to Amazon a mistakenly bought the non Bluetooth Spen thinking it was the original so I am not going to defraud anybody by returning this phone without the Actually SPen. I will save up $65 dollars and purchase the pen later, Overall Solid Device if you lose the pen just consider it like a S9 Plus with a boxy shape"
5034,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"I received a near flawless ocean blue note 9 fully unlocked and it is working great!. It has the oem yellow s-pen. The phone has 128 gig memory and 6 gig ram. I expected it to have a flashed vendor brand that shows on the screen upon startup, but this has no vendor branding and shows a cool colored lock unlocking upon start or restart.  The finger print reader is superb and has been unlocking almost everytime on the first attempt. It came with a basic white charger and cable. It had 0% charge when I recieved it but it charged right up and I put a t-moble sim card from note 8 and I could immediately make calls on the note 9.  It was delivered by usps in 3 days to ohio. Thanks."
5035,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"I was initially skeptical to purchase a refurbished phone however the cost of one was what my budget could afford at the time. When I finally received the phone, I was astonished at the quality of the product. It was like brand new! No visible marks or even scratches. It has been 2 weeks since receiving and no complaints to date! Very happy with my purchase!!"
5036,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"You know... I was on the fence about getting this. There are so many deals from private sellers locally but I thought well it is prime and can be returned so despite some of the awful reviews I went ahead and bought it. Best decision I have made in a long time. I am shocked. I am a tech guy and this phone is perfect. The battery health is at 97 percent. Not a single scratch on either side (I looked with Intense lighting) and every single component (wifi, Bluetooth, speakers, you name it) all work perfectly. I honestly feel like this phone was used maybe once and returned. Even the s-pen has full charge capacity. I could not be more satisfied. I will continue purchasing from this seller in the future!"
5037,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,phone is good but wrong charger sent luckily have extra
5038,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"Face recognition  a little  slow  and you have to hold the phone straight to your face,  finger print reader miss some time,Battery life  is ok.Have to returned the first one cause of the selfie camera was blurry.  Seller sent  a second one quickly,  very pleased with the phone.  Do buy renewed product again hope the quality as good."
5039,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"I ordered the unlocked version. It said Verizon on box, charger and phone screen so i was worried it wasn't going to work. I needed it to be fully unlocked to connect to metro. I ignored all the Verizon prompts and pushed ahead and it was able to connect to metro. I have an old note 9 and just wanted the same phone but new. I was skeptical bc of some of the reviews. The phone I received looks brand new. The screen is bright and clear. The speaker and microphone work brand new. These were all issues I was having with my old phone. Its exactly what I was hoping for. I will try and add photos later."
5040,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"It's new phone except only USB-C port has indication small normal wear of plugged.  I am using wireless charging so it doesn't bother at all.  Used for 2 weeks and works like new, looks like new.  Find many ways to save battery runtime by doing this-and-that stuff.  After few configuration, it stays 60% at the end of day after normal use, as a no phone gamer.Good seller.  would recommend."
5041,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"The phone has worked great so far:  However, I have hear some smallsnapping sounds from time to time that I've chalked up to ""static electricity""??  But....I bought a nice case for the phone, and have noticed thT after I have been using it on a busy afternoon that it has appeared with the sound,....in the middle of the phone under the screen color it looks like a streak of moisture? Not sure what this about. Otherwise love my refurbished phone!"
5042,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"The phone was a refurbished phone.  It looked brand new. When I got it, it came with the pin to open the sim and SD card area, charger and phone.  The charger didn't work but it was an easy fix. A few weeks later I realized the camera wouldn't let me zoom in.  It would shut down anytime I tried.  I contacted the seller and they were very responsive and helpful. I ordered another phone which they overnighted me and sent me a return label. I was able to sync the other phone to the new one which looked brand new and so far everything seems to work perfectly. I love the phone and everything about it so far.  I love the stylus as well."
5043,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"Phone arrived in a decent package. Charger and cable were generic.Phone quality and condition was top notch!2 minor scratches, easily covered by a case. Works like new from the factory."
5044,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,When I first got it the charge was terrible but I stuck with it. With different charger cords and charger heads it was a ruff time but after a while it got itself together I guess lol. And it's been about perfect since. I'm going on a year with this phone.
5045,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"I would have given it 5 stars.  It works great, keeps a charge but said it came with the key for the card slot and it didn't."
5046,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,"Works great, looks great. Only problems are the battery life and a slightly loose s pen. Battery issue can be minimized if you put it in Battery saving mode(lower screen resolution and cpu) This will give you about 15-18 hours of solid use depending on what you're doing. Definitely recommend though, i love the phone."
5047,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note 9,128 GB,Android 8.1,6.4 Inches,It's nice but battery life is not good it last me day for a new phone I should get a refund back

5056,Xiaomi,Redmi 9A,32 GB,"MIUI 12, Android 10.0",6.53 Inches,"This is a great phone. I got two for my wife and daughter. Feels a little heavy it seems very sturdy.It comes with a bunch of preinstalled Xiaomi stuff. You'll probably want to delete some of them and keep only the things you need (some of the apps are really good). Or you can just leave them there, since there's plenty of space. The phone is fully customizable in terms of looks and functionality.It came with MIUI 12 but recently upgraded to MIUI 12.5 (not sure if it will eventually move to 13)..It doesn't have some of the ""smart"" features of other phones, but still it is impressive. It is a great phone for people who don't expect ""high end"" features. It is for people who just wants social networks, videos/music, calls, nice photos, and light gaming. For all of that, at this price, it is unbeatable."

5086,Xiaomi,Redmi 9A,32 GB,"MIUI 12, Android 10.0",6.53 Inches,"This is a great phone. I just wish it had a magnetometer in it, which would make GPS more accurate and would also serve as a compass (which would be nice since I go hiking a lot). Instead, the phone relies entirely on cell signal for GPS. My next phone will have a magnetometer.Also, there's no fingerprint reader, which can come in handy for signing in to some apps. Battery life is pretty good. I won't say ""amazing"" because it seems to drain somewhat quickly when you're using the phone.At first, I thought this phone would be too big and I would need to return it, since my last phone was about an inch smaller. But after a few weeks, I got used to the bigger size, and now I really like this phone. It definitely takes up a lot of room in your pants pocket though."

5099,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"Seeing as how this is a refurbished phone, I was skeptical of what actual quality I was going to receive even though it stated in excellent condition.  I am a huge Apple user, and have had Apple phones and products for over 10 years.  Before that, I had an old Samsung, and I remember being so excited to upgrade to an Iphone.Now, x years later, I am tired of the same old thing with Apple products, and wanted to see how Samsung had fared in updates and software. I also didn't want to spend too much money on a brand new Samsung if I ended up not liking it.  Online shopping I went, and I found this Samsung Galaxy Note 10 plus for a fair price.  I purchased mine from Edge Cellular, who had pretty good reviews, and upon receiving my phone I was shocked to find barely any scratches.  There is one incredibly thin, thinner than a hair, scratch on the screen that I can only see when the screen is black and I'm undulating the phone around in a bright light.  That's it.  As for the back, you can see a few surface scratches, nothing deep, nothing that eye noticing, and even with a clear case on to display that stunning back, you still won't see it.  The S pen is in great shape, and there's only a few little scratches here and there on the silver top and bottom from whoever's normal wear and tear.  Nothing horrible, and let me say, my husband was totally shocked.  I think he was expecting deep gouges, and there's nothing like that here.  It does come with a wall charger, and a USB C cable, FYI.I am also coming from an Iphone 11, FYI.  So this screen is bigger at 6.8 versus 6.1, and I am loving the difference.  It's still not huge, can fit in my small palm nicely, and doesn't seem to have that bulk that the Iphone does.  I use Straight Talk as well, and I had no trouble popping out my SIM card, and inputting it in this one.  As soon as I turned it on, my signal, and everything else was working fine. I didn't even have to charge the phone as it came with 98% battery already.I did not do the sync, because I did not have a USB C to USB lightning charger available, and I didn't feel like doing the wifi thing, so I downloaded from the cloud what I could, and that was it. I have my contacts, which was what I really needed (seriously who remembers a phone number these days?), and then downloaded my apps that I use.I forgot how much fun it was to have widgets of almost all apps that I use!  I only did about three for my heavy use apps, but I love that I can move the icons all over the screen and not have them just to an ""open"" spot like on the Iphone.  Here you can literally move an app anywhere.  Top, bottom, side, right, middle, it doesn't matter, it's going to stick wherever you put it.  The S pen is amazing, as I can pop that out, and use the stylus to move things around to or scroll.  I love the note feature as I'm a working mom who writes notes all the times.  So much easier than opening notes on iPhone I personally feel.  My biggest issue with not going with an Android before this is basically the apps. I was an app fanatic, and Apple does have so much more apps.  But now that I've gotten older, I use apps, but not as heavily gaming as before.  My games now consist of kids games and kids youtube (if you can't tell from that statement...I have toddlers).I do have an Apple watch and airpods, and the airpods bluetoothed fine with the phone.  There is no distinct sound when I put them in letting me know they are paired as they do with the iPhone though.  I don't know if that's a setting issue, or if some of the features they had dissipated when I went with Android.  My watch, of course, does not pair with the phone, but I still get messages, calls, and emails when I'm on wifi, which I am when I'm at work and home.The only thing that I am going to watch out for is battery life.  I was at 100% this morning, and when I took it off of charge, looked at emails, and texted my husband I went to 98%, and from small use, the aforementioned, taking a few pictures, a few text, and being it on it just a little, I'm at 89% in two hours.  I'll update in a few days on battery life.  I do browse a lot, go on FaceBook, check emails, other apps, and I do watch movies a lot on my phone thanks to my children's movie nights, when this mom is tired of watching Encanto on repeat.Lastly, the face recognition works pretty well! I didn't do the fingerprint scanner, just face and a code.  I'm not sure if it's a setting thing, but I am used the iPhone ""waking"" when I pick it up, and this one I have to press the button on the side to wake so I can use the face recognition.  On the iPhone, you pick it up, and it's super quick to open in any lighting.  This one isn't, but it doesn't bother me that match, and I'll look in settings to see if I can reconfigure that ""waking"" when I pick the phone up.  Camera is also decent.  I take a lot of pictures of my kids, etc, and I find that its pretty on par when it comes to comparing the iPhone 11 to this one.  It looks like my iPhone takes a little better pictures sometimes, then then Galaxy takes better at others. It's just a toss up there.  In the newer phones you will definitely get the clearer pictures, but this one still does a great job.Again, Edge Cellular seems to be the best bet in getting a good phone in great condition!  Looks amazing, and I'll update with pictures and on the battery life shortly."
5100,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"Seller: SnergyOrder Date: March 19th, 2022Order price @ Time of purchase: $419**The phone arrived arrived a few days after it's scheduled delivery date. Though the status of it was updated alongside actual package arrivals/departures so that was fine.Unboxing: Opening the unoriginal boxing the phone came in; It arrived in a plastic bag within a white cardboard box. The phone shipped with unoriginal wall adapter/brick & cable. And none of the OEM accessories like the AGK headphones nor an actual SIM Card Removal Tool. It came with a paperclip instead.Outside Impressions:â€¢ The phone was impressive lighter than my Note 9, which this phone was replacing. I noticed the weight difference immediately.â€¢ I inspected the rear glass and was blown away by the this color: Aura Glow. The finish and how well it captured light and reflected objects in its glass was and is still great.â€¢ The camera system was without damage or scratches.â€¢ However the metal frame of the phone at the bottom had deep grooves of scratches from a hard drop it seemed. It can be felt with hand and enough depth to catch on smooth surfaces. Damages were along the sides as well.â€¢ The build felt solid in hand, when I didn't focus on the damages from the past user. Study but light. Took some time to get used to.â€¢ The Screen was huge. 1440x3040 that can be turn down if you are concerned about batteyr life. Bigger screen to body ratio than my Note 9 as well while not bigger much larger in its actual dimensions for me. I have fairly large hands. What troubled me mostly was the damaged screen. It had a noticeable gouge in the screen towards the top right 1/4 of the display that simply could not be ignored. It was easily felt under thumb and finger and even visible with screen off/on.**I returned the phone asking for a refund as it was beyond regular wear and tear use. Synergy gave me NO problem whatsoever with this. And emailed me within a few hours to a day that they will process a full refund upon receiving the product back. I did pay shipping back for the device. I was disappointed with that however I am happy with Synergy's customer support even though my product was not as it should have been. It gives me confidence to purchase with them in the future as good customer service is hard to come by today. The only issues where the damages that I saw and tested the phoneAs for today, 4/14/22:I have ordered a new Note 10+ 512GB version this review is based on the good working device I received and couldn't be happier with the device itself outside of the features it loses from the Note 9. The Note 9 was truly the last no compromise Smartphone of the Era. So i wouldn't call the Note 10+ an upgrade > Note9(N9) as much as I would say a Left-Right change of features for the user..â€¢ Fingerprint scanner: In screen fingerprint sensor.. While consistent in my use, it is slow to read even with developer mode enabled.â€¢ Face Scanner: To make up for the ""poor"" speed of the FP scanner I make use of the face scanner feature to unlock the phone. This isn't the same as the Iris Scanner from the Note 9 (N9) and it is not as secure as the Iris Scanner but to serves my needs the same and is faster than the finger print scanner and faster than the Note 9 Iris scanner (both have .5 animation speed in developer settings).â€¢ The features of the S Pen are nice but I haven't explored them all. I do consistently use it for various tasks and apps and signing documents and editing.â€¢ Camera is very good. MANY settings in the pro mode and many camera modes itself. I use GCam myself. Big improvement I believe.â€¢ Still testing battery life as the phone learns user usage to better optimize battery will updateâ€¢ Phone calls are clear and good.â€¢ Speakers are impressively loud as well. I'm glad because I watch videos/play music (Netflix/Crunchyroll/Spotify) often. Bottom firing speaker and earpiece speaker sound good to the ear.Snapdragon chip, fast and 12gb of ram. No lag and running andriod 12, running 4.1UI but I have a launcher that I find suits my needs better. You won't be made at this phone in 2022. I only upgrade, at most, every three years unless phone is stolen/loss/damaged outside warranty. Definitely happy with the huge screen, faster chip, S Pen, SD card slot (fitted with a 1TB  PNY) and factory unlocked."
5101,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"My main complaint is that the refurbishing team did not clean the s pen slot. I noticed it felt weird taking it out but when I cleaned it with a q tip it was GRODY. The phone works with the s pen but it keeps saying its disconnected when i put it away which is sorta annoying. Also, it seems like my phone can't keep up with how fast I type because it misses taps but that could also be my screen protector. Despite this, I enjoy the quality of the phone. Everything seems to work well internally for me so far. (Only had the phone for 2 days now.) The only physical defects on the phone itself was the bottom corner near the s pen."
5102,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"The phone came pretty much as good as new. The only thing that gave it away was that I could tell it had a phone cover on it by looking at the dirt/marking around the camera lens. If the phone was cleaned properly I wouldn't have been able to tell it apart from a brand new phone.If you are wondering if the Note 10+ is good for you or not here is what I've found so far. Productivity wise it's amazing, it makes doing a lot of ""phone things"" easier. If your number priority is a great camera this one will disappoint you. I don't know what Samsung did but the camera in my opinion is terrible. I wouldn't use it to post on Instagram(Maybe a story) But other than that it's really great, charges really fast especially if you get the original 25w charger. The charger that was included was terrible and made a weird buzzing noise, so definitely purchase the Samsung 25w charger.Summary: An amazon renewed phone comes like new, the Note10+ is amazing at being a phone but terrible with taking pictures and videos."
5103,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"I have no complaints about this phone at all. It was exactly as described. In excellent condition! It works inside the US as well as out of the country. I was able to use it when I traveled to two different countries in Africa. And it accepted their local Sim card! Great camera! Battery life, fingerprint reader works. 256 GB. Only thing I'm indifferent about is the color of my pen. And that is an easy fix once I purchase the color I want. I would definitely recommend this seller products to be accurate.  And to back it up they provide a 90 return policy and warranty."
5104,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"This phone does everything I need it to do and the battery lasts all day. The display is big, bright and vivid and it's performance is top-notch. It arrived as a new phone in perfect condition. Thanks for a great product and thanks to Amazon for a fast delivery."
5105,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"Great value for the money you pay.What comes in the box??Mine came in a sketchy looking white box but contained a fancy shaped sim injector, cheap cable (not Samsung), and a cheap charger block (also not Samsung).The phone did have plastic peels on the screen, camera setup, sensors, and around the edges of the phone.I tested every last one of the sensors in the phone.with the built in number you can dial in the phone app.S pen feels great but the latency of this generation is definitely not the perfect smoothe experience, though that is not to blame the manufacturer.BATTERY!the battery life is Amazing. Some days it will go all day on a single full charge, but on occasion it will rapidly die faster than expected.If your getting this to play games on it then I have really good news for you. This phone can and will plow through max graphics 60fps call of duty mobile, plays apex legends mobile smoothly, genshin impact also runs well.Screen wiseThe screen is nice and bright, very colour accurate compared to my galaxy a10e LED panel. The note 10+ has a 91% screen to body ratio. Meaning most of the phone is screen. The screen itself is an AMOLED/oled display, really dark colours and blacks are at their best here. Screen curves do not impose too much accidental touches. Screen didn't arrive with a single mark. The display automatically uses either 1080p or (3/4) 4kIt comes with 256 gb of storage (I love) and 12 gb of ram (hardly ever uses 6)PriceSo for what after about 2 or 3 months of using this, I would say that the normal $799.99 hefty price tag one of these note 10+ cost in store let's renewed prices shine bright. For saving about $300 you will not regret purchasing this. Now it is on its last leg for security updates and further android updates, but android with one UI version 4.1 is all it needs. Finger print reader and facial recognition are nice."
5106,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Cannot complain about the phone. The phone works like brand new.No scratches or anything.Arrive a day earlier than expected.
5107,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"This phone was perfect. You would never know it was refurbished. I went from the Galaxy Note 10 to the Note 10+. The only reason I replaced my Note 10 was because my carrier made some changes and my phone would no longer work on their system. In comparison, the only thing that may become an issue is the battery. It may simply be that the battery Samsung used in the 10+ charges much slower than the battery in the regular Note 10. It also doesn't hold a charge as long."
5108,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"I am so happy with my phone, it has everything mentioned by the seller, the face recognition is spot on, I took my fingerprint too., so now I unlock my phone with either one of them. Everything works, it's a renewed phone but it doesn't look like it, it's brand new for me. Thank you!"
5109,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,I am happy with this purchase. It does everything I need it to do. I love the on screen fingerprint reader.
5110,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"Haven't had it very long... but it came packaged great.  It was a refurbished so didn't know what to expect.  Condition as far as marks go... it was flawless! When 1st turning it on was concerned because it seemed glitchy, but have used it now a couple days and seems fine.  The battery life is what concerns me... definitely don't believe the battery is new. It wears downs kind of quick,  but maybe that's a Note 10+ for ya... face recognition and finger print reader works great.  Overall happy with my purchase! This person definitely knows how to package their stuff because my husband got 1 from someone else and it wasn't packed as nicely as mine!"
5111,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"Seller was - CELLULAR GALLERY INCI love the phone, Looks great - no major scratches and it works really good for the most part, the face recognition doesn't always work 100% but it works most of the time.  I didn't however get the proper S pen with this phone.  My phone keeps asking me to connect the S pen via Bluetooth and it wont connect  because it doesn't appear to be the Bluetooth version of the S pen, like i should have received.  I can use it on the phones screen but i have none of the other features i should be getting with on the Note 10 Plus, like camera control with the pen and air motion control w/ the pen.  I am disappointed that I paid a good amount of money for this phone and it didn't come with the proper parts.  Just be aware if you purchase from this seller they may cheap out on the kind of pen the SHOULD provide that actually came with this version of phone."
5112,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"The phone came looking brand new, even had the film you have to peel off the screen, no scratches.  I was impressed. I bought this for my gf and she thought I bought her a brand new phone.  I had to explain that it's technically used, but she didn't believe me.  She thought I was being modest. Brownie points for me ğŸ˜†"
5113,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,The phone came like new and works like new also looks new great deal
5114,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"Phone came pretty dirty and the s pen slot was really gross, the s pen was stuck and I basically had to pry it out of the slot cause it was so gunked up. After some good cleaning the phone looked basically new, besides a minor blemish on the screen which was a letdown. But that's what you get when you buy ""refurbished"". Great phone otherwise."
5115,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,The phone works and is like new
5116,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"The phone is great and all tho the only problem is the s pen does not read in the phone at the moment (not that it doesn't work)it's just the phone keeps say s pen is disconnected ,waiting on the next update to see it it going to make it better  apart from that I have no issues with the phone."
5117,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"I really like this phone.  I lost my Note 20 in the river when I was kayaking. I decided I didn't want to spend $1200 on a new one,  so I went with this one as it was refurbished.  The phone has never given me any issues and works just like a brand new phone."

5119,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Batter life is very good. Fingerprint is expectedly fast and face recognition works as it should.
5120,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"The note10+ is nuthing short but amazing it's fast its slim its got an amazing amount of multitasking ability...the certified vendor however certainly didn't mention that it has a dead pixel spot on the screen...even tho this device wuz listed with zero screen defects. So be wary other then that I hav zero complaints about the device itself & it's capabilities again the vendor, is where any if the downside of it resides...vendor also fails to mention it NOT BEING 5G CAPABLE!!! When I searched for this device I specifically wanted a 5G phone so thanks much!!!!"

Â This was really the first 'big' purchase I have made so far, aside from my car. I have been using an absolutely rallied Galaxy 8+ since highschool.  And let me say, what an upgrade! I did a lot of review reading on both under this phone, and the sellers that partner with Amazon Renewed to sell it. My Galaxy 8 was renewed, the first one didn't charge, sent it back and got the one I kept, but headphone jack never worked. In a so far successful attempt to avoid something like that with this phone, I decided to order through Edge Cellular, since they had the most positive response. And I'm so happy I did! First of all, I got the phone in FOUR days, including the day I ordered it and the day it arrived. I live in Alaska, so that's practically unheard of.  The only way I could tell this phone was not brand new, was two extremely minor surface scratches on the back, which is obviously expected. And the S Pen had a tiny bit of white paint on it, that wiped right off. Other then that, the phone was pristine, not even a fingerprint, until I picked it up. It started right up, charges perfect, it's unlocked, the S Pen works, battery life is basically stagnant if it's not being used, and it's absolutely beautiful. I don't have any complaints so far, it has been almost two weeks since I received the phone. If that changes, I will update my review :)"
5127,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,I was a little skeptical about ordering an unlocked phone but it was in excellent condition and it worked perfect with my Cricket service. The battery life isn't very good but these phones are known for that but my charger charges the phone in less then 30 min.
5128,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"I bought this phone for my husband for his birthday. He loves it, and now I'm thinking about getting one for myself."
5129,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"It's a big phone to me. The color of the phone is beautiful. The pen is very smart and reactive. The face recognition is spot on. The pixels in the phone are immaculate. I absolutely love the camera. Its a vet tech savvy phone and super smart. Extremely easy set up. Also, very easy to use and get use to. I love this phone and I def recommend. The vendor did an amazing job was well â¤ï¸"
5130,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"1. Fast shipping A+2. Note10+ looks pristine A+3. Works on Verizon (unlocked). Just added Sim & works. A+(came in AT&T box, was confused at 1st glance)4. Battery in great condition. A+Cons: the battery came completely drained & took a few minutes to respond after it was plugged in. I imagine this is why fast charging didn't work at first. To fix not fast changing, charge to 100% let the battery drain a bit 80%, with the phone unplugged from power, then flip the fast charging toggle a few times, finally leaving it on, in battery settings. Then press volume down & power at same time for 10 seconds to force shutdown. (you may have to change power button preferences from Bixby to Power button in settings. Mine was set to Bixby upon arival). Power on phone, plug in ""fast charge"" QC 3.0 capable cord & CHARGER to phone. Fast Charging fixed. Next step was to fix the wifi from intermittently turning off. In settings, go to ""connections"" then ""wifi"", click ""3 dots"" top right, select ""advanced"". Make sure 'Switch to mobile data"" is turned off. Go back to ""settings"" main menu, scroll down to & select ""General management"". Once inside select ""Reset"". Finally ""Reset Network Settings"". It'll explain that wifi, mobile data, & Bluetooth hardware will be reset to factory settings if u continue to ""RESET SETTINGS"", click it. Restart phone, reconnect ur wifi & fixed. (It was probably the 10 updates that screwed wifi hardware settings). But now all is perfect & running as should be & I don't fault the seller for the wifi issue. Although, the fast charge not working is most likely due to seller shipping drained battery. All in all, great purchase & value Note10+ 12GB ram 256GB storage."
5131,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"If the unit is refurbished it's hard to tell.  The screen film on it suggested that the screen was replaced on mine.  The screen is completely clean and new.  The performance of the battery seems better than expected.  I have gone 3 days without charging and it never dropped below 50%.  However, I have gone 1 day and the battery dropped to almost 50%, so it depends on what applications you have going.  If you are upgrading from one android to this android you will find it is self configuring.  I simply inserted my att chip in and it booted right up recognizing my chip and self configured itself.  There just a few apps I had to install on it that were on my previous phone.As far as the company, they shipped without any lag time.  I have not had any reason for contacting them since everything is going well with it.I did take the time to insert into a case right away which is waterproof.  I highly recommend it.  The case has a surface membrane, which I think influences the finger print option on it.  However, I did not have to add an additional screen protector because of it.  I am still trying to get used to the stylus.This phone is the same size as my previous phone.  I upgraded for the speed and the camera capabilities.This phone is loaded with features which you can find on the internet.  I look forward to exploring all of them.  So far, real good."
5132,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Phone look and worked like new. Was skeptical about ordering phone off Amazon but was happily surprised
5133,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"Phone came in without a scratch! Looks and acts brand new.--Update as of 7/7/2022--Been using this as my main phone,  I originally bought it at $400 when the price was higher 6 months ago.. I'm having a great experience, might have got lucky with them choosing a better phone out of the bunch. It's been working on METRO PCS just fine, the battery is working phenomenally, & I'm loving the camera.Haven't had any complaints with it.. still feel the same about it since the day I was spending all hours researching about this NOTE 10 plus. I got the Aura Glow (Silver) variant & threw a sweet clear case on it tagged with the privacy gel screen protector; looks sick. Everytime I see it on the table face down it feels like I'm in the future, though it's about a 3 yr old phone. Planning to keep it for a long time, thank you for selling these at a reasonable price!-a real review"
5134,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Bought it for my daughter because her phone gave out. I previously owed a note 10+ and she wanted it so I got it for her
5135,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"This is the 2nd Note 10+ I purchased from this Seller. Both phones appear and work like NEW.  Although they are ""unlocked"" for use with most carriers this phone (my 2nd purchase) is an AT&T branded phone and is loaded with AT&T's typical ""bloatware"" which cannot be removed without ""rooting the phone"" which I do not intend to do. I bought this phone for my wife and she really doesn't care about the bloatware since she really only uses a dozen or so apps. The phone has ample internal memory, 256 gb, along with 12 gb of ram this phone is powerhouse compared to her old phone (a Galaxy Note 4). She is happy and when ""Momma's happy I'm happy"".Commenting on both of the Note10+ phones I've purchased from this seller I can honestly say there was NO HINT ANYWHERE that either phone was ""renewed"" except for the generic white box they came in. They looked BRAND NEW. I watched comparison reviews of the Note 10+ vs. the Note 20 + prior to purchasing these phones and the thumbs up went to the Note 10+.  and the cost was less than 1/2  of a new Note 20+  The only other minor issue is the fingerprint readers aren't very reliable. These phones were a good fit for what we needed and this seller did everything right. I WOULD recommend to my friends."
5136,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Overall the phone is awesome however the pen is not responding well on the screen. otherwise the phone looks like new and i love it
5137,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Price is too high
5138,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"This is the 3rd Amazon renewed phone for me, my husband has bought 2 as well. Each we have received has been in just about perfect condition; no visible flaws, no probs with performance. Have yet to needed to use the guarantee. We recommend the renewed phones to everyone and will continue to purchase them going forward. The only negative I've had is a charger cable that didn't work with the phone but I didn't care since I have a wireless charger that worked just fine, and a spare cable that also worked great."
5139,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Excelentes condiciones
5140,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"Phone is in great shape with only the smallest amount of wear. Works like new, super fast processor moves quickly between apps without hesititation, which is what I needed. 4 stars because transferring my service to it was not easy, at all, and although I use t-mobile it still boots up verizon. It works, so I'm good with it, but the process was annoying and it continually shows a warning that the inserted Sim is not verizon. All in all though I am happy with the purchase."
5141,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"Alright... just got my phone, was very nervous I would get scammed or ripped off but its here now and Ill go off what I presently have and then will update as I use the phone more.Seller: RE-CELLShipping: Super fast, 2 days early (very nice)Product: Note 10+Condition: Phone looks great, hardly any visible use at all. Battery seems strong but we will see how it holds. included the cable, box, and even a  pin to get to the sim card (a very nice touch).Im very pleased so far... THRILLED that there doesnt seem to be any issues other reviewers sent theirs back for in a long painful process of waiting to get another. Im still adjusting all my data and such but the phone seems to be an excellent choice for me at the moment. So far so good. Thank you Re-cell"
5142,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy s9 plus to this phone Samsung galaxy Note 10 plus I love it
5143,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"I havent bought any flagship phones for 1k plus since I wised up about 5 years ago. I am a proponent of bang-for-buck. Some would even say I'm cheap. However, does being cheap mean I can't have nice things? No. It. Does. Not. This phone is very nice, a new ""cheap"" phone at t-mobile is about $200 and you will need to replace it every 2-3 years. For 350, this is more than twice the happiness I would get from a new $200 phone, ergo, mathematically, this is the best phone to buy for cheap, and to have a really, really nice phone."
5144,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,The battery life is great. Haven't tried the face recognition yet
5145,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,I love this phone it has lots of great features. The phone looks brand new. The packaging and the charger are the only things that made it possible to tell it wasn't a new phone. I am using it on Mint Mobile and had no problem getting it setup and working.
5146,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"I use my phone for everything, and have had no problems what so ever."
5147,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,"The phone is great overall, great camera good battery and great UI, also it has a big screen. My only issue is I was given the wrong color, silver instead of white"
5148,SAMSUNG,Galaxy Note10+,256 GB,Android 9.0,6.8 Inches,Love this phone Awesome! For the picture above take a picture of a new note 10 plus and that is how great this phone looks. Thank you ! Jay
5149,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,am very glad of purchase
5150,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,good & decent priced cell-phone
5151,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,"EDIT: The listing said  ""LTE bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 20, 28, 38, 40, 41 (120 MHz); (LATAM) 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 28"". I trusted this and brought the phone to India, where it does not work on 4G. I then looked up the version number of this phone and it says TA-1391. I looked it up, and the only 4G bands supported are 2,4,5,7 and 41.Original review: This is a strange beast. It is not just the bezel; the USB connector is micro-USB, and new phones haven't used those in years. The back can be opened and the battery replaced---a good thing in principle, but also adds to the impression that this is an old phone. The listing currently says the OS is Android 11, but in fact it is Android 11 Go, a lite version designed for phones with only 2GB of RAM. This also indicates an old design, what new phone has only 2GB RAM? Another 2GB would cost, what, $5 more? Incidentally, it is an import from Latin America somewhere and does not have a warranty."
5152,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,A very nice phone for the price. Has some good features and functions like more expensive phones. I am very happy with the purchase.
5153,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,"Bought this as a first phone for my 13-year-old son because he doesn't need anything high end,  but I wanted him to have some way to be reachable. This failed miserably because it doesn't make or receive phone calls reliably. He answers and it immediately disconnects. We tried all kinds of troubleshooting with the carrier to no avail. Then today it stopped being able to connect to wireless either, so I tried to reboot it and it's been hanging on the ""Restarting..."" screen for the last half hour. Very frustrating! I thought Nokia was a decent brand!"
5154,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,"Just ordered this and brand new out of the box it doesn't work. Absolutely nothing. First of all for some god forsaken reason they actuallly used a USB-b port on it instead of USB-c despite the fact that the entire industry protty much disconinued the use of b years before this phone came out. Which you know Nokia knows not only because they're part of the industry, but because the instructions come with a huge warning not to try to use usb c with it. Because they know it's the industry standard for a reason and it's what everyone uses for everything so they need to remind you that they purposely used the wrong port on this phone just to punish you for not buying high end for whatever reason of necesity that you didn't.And what do you know. Brand new out of the box it won't take a chage. Probably because the BAD PORT IS BAD WHICH IS WHY YOU DON'T USE THAT ONE. I've tried multiple outlets, multiple blocks, and multiple cables nothing. Won't take a charge, you can tell because it's still ice cold after being plugged in for over an hour. Won't turn on. It's a brick.So now I've been out of the loop with work for over 72 hours since my last phone died, I ordered this while waiting for a Planet Computer Astro Slide to ship from overseas and I can't even get updated before Monday because amazon shipped me a broken phone.Unless Jeff Bezos himself swings through my plate glass windows on a vine in a loin cloth like george of the jungle, and slaps my phone to life like the Fonz, before backflipping back out through the broken glass as penance for having already wasted this much of my time I swear I will binge watching everything worth watching (not much) on prime vidwo which I finally started just to make sure I got this phone on tiem only for this to happen anyway, then cancelling before they can charge me a penny for it."
5155,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,"Nokia C01 has no fingerprint reader!  Instead requires code to unlock-which was not mentioned in phone description.I would never buy it if I knew it!This is my forth Nokia and the worst one. I knew Nokia as the most logical cell phone on the market without unneeded junk stuf in its programming. My first Nokia 610 (working on Windows) was the best. Customer support used now by Nokia is probably universal for most of cell phones (seams the same like for Iphones?) I feel myself very unsatisfied with my new Nokia. Very sad, sad world."
5156,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,I have been using this phone for some time now and the problems I have run into are causing me to decide to buy a different Phone. The phone is controlled by google so I get ads in my text messages. The only way to not get ads is to pay google to not put ads in my messages. The next problem I have run into lately is when I send or receive a message from my daughter or Granddaughter they also get the message. Also I just discovered messages I send to my son-in-law my grandson also gets the same message. So the privacy of my messages is not there. I have deleted the names and put the information back in and it still happens. So I can't receive or send messages to one person alone. This is unacceptable.
5157,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,I was satisfied with the cell phone
5158,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,"I don't know what's going on, but for a battery to drop 50% in less than 9 hours with no google bloat, no computer and using only text messaging? I'm sending it back."
5159,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,I like everything
5160,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,I donâ€™t like it
5161,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,Adorable cell phone

5163,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,El telefono funciona perfectamente en Cuba pero no recibe la senal de 4G que es lo que la gente esta buscando. Por lo demas es un telefono con buena calidad.
5164,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,It is slow.  An out going call takes too long to start ringing.  I can't hear my phone calls.  The battery life sux.  I wish I had never bought it.  Digging through an old log is such a pain.  They are hard to get them to behave.
5165,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,For this price itâ€™s okay. Canâ€™t complain with iphone13I just need unlocked phone for a month of vacation.
5166,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,"Yo lo compre para enviÃ¡rselo a mi hermano en Cuba y  el esta muy feliz con el telÃ©fono nuevo, excelente calidad, buen tamaÃ±o para poder textear y navegar en internet, el diseÃ±o es muy practico, me llego bien rÃ¡pido menos de una semana ya lo tenia en mi casa y cuando llego a  Cuba mi hermano lo empezÃ³ a usar el mismo dÃ­a.Gracias!"

5169,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,"If you plan to get this phone for it's Volte compatibility to use on Tracfione (uses AT&T network), do not buy. The phone will not work."
5170,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,"Unfdortunately I need to return the phone.  It is not compatible with the carrier I have for my cell phone service.Please send me what I need to return it, Please.It was a really nice phone."
5171,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,Not good at all
5172,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,It doesn't work with the cricket wireless network
5173,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,"For a less than $100 device it's surprisingly fast along with being value for money, lightweight in that it doesn't weigh down in your pocket too."
5174,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,"Bought it in April and has already died.  Very sluggish, even on 4G or WiFi.  I tried to sell it through a kiosk and got a message eco smart couldn't buy it, due to problems the scanner found, so I donated it."
5175,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,Everything is good about this phone.  Nice color light weight. Good camera. Android operation. Windows system. But can change over to other system if needed.  Simple but works has. All apps thatâ€™s used daily.  Great!!!!  An it wonâ€™t break the bank.
5176,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,Love this Phone..Simple...  elegant ...not invasive like the iphone
5177,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,Value for moeny
5178,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,Bought a used phone from this person the phone will not recognize the SIM card. Now I'm stuck with this piece of junk because no refunds. Buying new direct of companies with warranty from now on!!!
5179,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,"Where to start, well the discription was wrong it is not 6.5 inches, and it does not have duel sim cards. I bought this for a back up phone, and was that a mistake. Switching to this phone was like going back to dial up internet, this phone was so slow. My og smartphone was faster than this device. This is really just a flip phone disguised as a smart phone. Don't waist your money I wouldn't even give this to a 6 year old."
5180,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,"It can not handle metro PCs network, when I need to use the Internet it's always unavailable."
5181,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,"I have no issue with Nokia brand nor product itself, unfortunately delivery was made with wrong configuration as single SIM not dual SIM. I understand I can return the unit but this mistake is not done by me. Please be careful buying from this seller, as fulfillment is not up to Amazon standard."
5182,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,"Piece of garbage, I spent half the day calling companies and doing phone compatibility checks online. I haven't found one company that this phone is compatible with, not Verizon, TMobile, Boost, Tracphone, etc. It should be illegal to sell phones that aren't compatible with US providers."
5183,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,"Nice cellphone for the price,havenâ€™t turn it on yet"
5184,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,The package looked great. But the phone does not work. It will not even turn on. I've wasted 80 bucks before so its ok if I do it again

I thougt that it has some defult passwords like 00000, 11111, etc and  I tried to enter some common passwords, but could not unlock the phone. I tried even to hard reset the phone, but failed.Most probably they send me a used, returned phone by some one who retuned the phone without doing factory reset.I  lost my 4-5 hours trying to unlock and Ireally got disappoonted. Finally have to returned the phone.I do not know  what the sellers are doing....."
5188,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,This phone is false advertising. This phone was supposed to be a unlock phone. I went all the way to Jamaica to find out itâ€™s not unlock . I was so piss to know these companies miss informing customers of there products

Though the carrier map says service should be great, there is none. So beware buying ancient technology that doesn't support 3G, 4G, etc. What you end up with is a lot of nothing."

5192,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,"I bought this phone based on it's a world phone to work in Europe, Latin America and Asia.

Pretty much useless. Can't return within return window as I am in India."

5198,Nokia,C01 Plus,1 GB,Android 11 (Go Edition),5.45 Inches,Hate the Google app..
5199,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I'm coming from a Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro which has been a spectacular phone. When I bought the phone it had a beautiful forest green glass back and felt premium all the way. Unpacking the Blu F91 5g with it's plastic back felt quite a bit cheaper to me. However we all put our phones in cases so maybe the plastic back won't bother me so much. I'm not a fan of the case that was shipped with this phone as it's too bulky for me. I prefer the clear and thinner ones that ship with Redmi's and earlier Blu phones (I had a Blu Vivo XL4 that had a beautiful case).That being said, after booting up and turning on the screen I found the screen to be nice and equivelent to my Redmi but larger. Still confortable in the hand. I kinda wanted to go with an Amoled screen this time but for a LCD this one is just fine. Seems to be a bit brighter in sunlight than my Redmi. Overall I find the phone to be pretty fast and smooth. As far as the interface, I don't know why these companies don't sell these phones with the stock Android launcher. My biggest gripe with this phone is the Blu launcher. There is not much customization you can do. And while they let you customize individual icons (which nobody will do) why not at least give us the option to change the shape of all the icons. We are stuck with circle icons here. Adding widgetts to the screen don't fit properly either. Not allowed to make them smaller. Maybe I'm nit picking here but if a company is going to put it's own launcher on the phone, at least make it a good one. You do have the option to install custom launchers but some of the ones that use google feed are a bit buggy on this phone. Hyperian launcher seems to be the one that works best. It's better than my Redmi in this way because with my Redmi if I used a 3rd party launcher I wasn't allowed to use gesture. With this phone you can.There's not much bloatware here which is good. About 4 games, 2 of which I kept cuz they are not bad games (Wordscape and Woodoku). They are easy to uninstall.Some reviews said the last security update was December 2021 but when I installed this in early July 2022 I got two updates, the March 2022 update and then the May 2022 update. Good on you Blu. I highly doubt this phone will ever get Android 12 but if we get security updates for two years consider yourself lucky as Blu has a poor reputation for updates. Its the reason the phone is cheap. A trade off I'm ok with.Just one speaker on this phone at the bottom. It's Ok. It's loud enough. You can enable a loudness switch in the enhanced sound setting. Doing this will make it louder but can tend to distort sometimes with this setting on. Call volume seems fine and people can here me just fine. Fingerprint reader works ok and is fast though with the case on it will sometimes miss it. I don't do face recognition.I use US Mobile which uses TMobile towers. After sim card insertion the phone set it up properly. Something my Redmi doesn't do. 5G Reception is good and fast throughout town. I notice during peak times when there is a lot of network congestion it will slow to a crawl. If I swtich it over to 4Glte it will be fast again. You would think it would automatically switch over to the fastest connection but it doesn't. I won't blame this on the phone as it may just be US mobile throttling 5G at peak times. I can't seem to get Wifi calling to work. No setting for it anywhere. I did get a notification to turn it on but when I tapped on the notification nothing happened. Then I would get the notification again minutes later. The only way to get rid of the notification was to swipe it away. Not sure whats up with that. I don't really care about wifi calling. Volte is better quality anyway.Which brings me to my biggest gripe on this phone. The NFC persistant notification. If you have NFC on which I always do, there is an NFC notification that stays there. I have found no way to get rid of it. The only way to get rid of this is to turn NFC off. This is a MAJOR annoyance and Blu if you read this, please let us turn this off in the next update. What the heck was your thinking here?I happened to have a 5 watt wireless charging pad. The wireless charging works though it is slower than the included wired 18 watt charger of course. A 10 watt charging pad would be twice as fast I would think. Phone does get warm while charging but nothing out of the ordinary.I'm not a photographer but the camera seems fine to me. People wondering where the wide angle camera is don't realize that you just have to zoom out to a negative value for it to show up. It takes good pictures and color looks decent. My biggest gripe is I like to take my photos at 16:9 aspect ratio and this isn't included in the camera app. Only 4:3 and full (20:9). Another design blunder. Using another camera app from the play store and you can take 16:9.I have no problem with the battery life. Gets me through the day and then some with heavy use. 3 days might be an overstatment.I haven't decided if I'm going to keep this phone or not. I had to replace the battery of my Vivo XL 4 after 14 months. So not sure of the longevity here. Redmi phones feel way more premium than this phone. That being said, it's not a bad phone for the money. Blu phones are getting much better. Upgrading to this phone gets me 5G, a bigger screen, wireless charging and a google discovery feed. It's got it's quirks but all phones do and you really can't beat the price.Side note. If you plan on using this overseas like Europe, you may want to check the bands. Europe's most common lte bands are 1,3,7, and 8. None of these bands are on this phone. And I don't see any of the 5G bands used in Europe on this phone either. Seems to be made strictly for the US.Edit: Unfortunately I'm going to have to return the phone. I started getting the same problem I saw someone else have where automatic select network slider just keeps turning on and off non stop. No network at all. I need a dependable phone at work and I can't have things like that happening. If you need something reliable I suggest another brand.Edit 2. I ended up buying the Moto one 5g Ace which I find to be a way more dependable and solid phone."
5200,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Not perfect but servicable.  It WILL work with AT&T, but only up to 4G LTE.  It WILL do 5G with T-Mobile.Additional points to be aware of: âš ï¸â“µ The documentation is very poor.  If you are intending to install a second SIM Card, you must be aware that the second card must be oriented in the reverse direction of the first SIM.  Also, the 2nd SIM slot is shared with the TF card.  So it's either or.â“¶ Wireless charging is only PARTIALLY enabled.  It will recognise an induction charger and report that it is charging, but the battery level will not budge."
5201,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"First i will say I am not a user of graphics intensive games so I may not push the phone to the limitsHaving said here are the pros, I found this phone to be a very capable product. The exterior feels very good quality. It came with everything... The case, a glass protector (I already cracked it), charger, cable and even buds. The large screen is a definite plus. It is nice and bright. The reception is great. I get 5g on T-Mobile almost all the time. Hotspot is much faster than my old phone.The cons are the blacks are not as good as my old phone. The camera is not as good either. If you are a pixel watcher you might not like it. On launch it kept installing games. I uninstalled an app called ""mobile services"" and the unwanted installations stopped. Lastly there are a lot of misses on the finger print unlock. I will try yo register my print.My conclusion, I went from a pixel 2XL to this phone. I also decided to write this review after some use to be more accurate. I have to say the phone is an impressive phone and I do recommend it. The areas where it lacks, like the black color rendering, the camera quality and the bloatware was more that offset by the price, snappy performance, larger screen, battery life, the faster internet, finger reader along with the feel and look.If you are a typical user like me you are going to like this phone. One thing I should mention is that because of the unwanted automatic installations I don't fully trust this phone. I still do my banking on my old phone but it was not a big deal for me."
5202,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Fantastic phone for the price, does everything I need and more. If I had to nitpick about one thing it's that the Wi-Fi speed is lacking as it prefers my 2.4Ghz network over my 5Ghz one(same network name) and I can't find a setting to tell it to preferably/only use 5Ghz connections when both are available. I also can't be bothered to mess around with my SSIDs to separate my network out and then hopefully force the phone to connect to 5Ghz side where presumably speed would be better. Not a big deal as I don't stream movies or the like on the phone in the first place, just phone calls, email, web browsing, the basics for me  .."
5203,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I've had the phone for a few weeks and decided to return it.The accessories it comes with are great.It comes with an actual plug for the outlet which is great, but the cable is short so multitasking is out of the question. It charges fast but it doesn't hold a charge as long as advertised so I was charging it 2-3 times a day.Also they include a case and screen protector. Both worked well while I had it. The case has a good grip and the touchscreen worked thru the protector.They included earphones, but I didn't try them out since I find the kinds that go in your ear uncomfortable.So why'd I return it?1. I couldn't send or receive pictures, gifs or videos thru messages. I had to use WhatsApp. Not all my contacts use this app so it only kinda fixed the issue.2. My data wouldn't work even this my carrier (mint) showed that I was using data. If I left an area with wifi, my internet would disappear. Except for Spotify, but it would only work if I was already using it and left a wifi area. I couldn't skip songs or search for anything, but it would still play music.3. The reception was varied when I used it for calls or video chat. It'd work fine over wifi, but was hit or miss when I left my house.4. The camera sucks. The video quality looks like it's from 2002. The images are meh. Macro is a joke.  I didn't really use my camera after that.Maybe I got a defective phone. Perhaps my carrier is incompatible. I don't recommend it."
5204,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I've come to always like BLU products and never had any issues with them.  The F91-5G is an INCREDIBLE phone!  It has A LOT of power with it without the price tag!  I love the fact that BLU has finally made a cell phone with NFC AND 5G along with a FAST processor that doesn't lag with graphic intensive games.  If you're looking for a cell phone WITHOUT all the ""bloat"" ware that usually comes with most cell phones these days, then consider the BLU F91-5G cell phone."
5205,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I've been checking out reviews of valued priced 5G phone to replaced my 3 yrs Motorola E5 plus that recently start to shutdown intermittently and won't startup, unless using the Boot Loader sequence Vol Down + Power.  After reading online reviews and comparing features, the Blu F91 checks out all the boxes of what I need.  I'm looking for More Ram and storage,  NFC support,  5000Ma battery for 3 days usage, 5G support and carrier unlocked for GSM network.  The MediaTek Dimensity 810 processor's performance is comparable with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 used in Motorola 5G phones. The OLED display is as good as the Samsung AMOLED. The touch screen respond is fast and fluid. The package includes a nice carbon fiber like case and tempered glass screen protector,  high current fast charger (Samsung makes you pay for the optional charger for their $1,300 Galaxy S22 Ultra !!) and a wired ear bud that doubles as an antenna for the built in FM radio.  The SIM adapter support DUAL SIM card for International travel.  I successfully backed up my Motorola Android 8 data and restore it to the new Blu F91 Android 11 seamlessly.  Blu default install includes a couple of games app that I was able to manually remove without any issues. Unlike most manufacturer, that preinstall Bloatware that are annoying and sometimes NOT Removable, Blu did not.  By default it comes with 128 GB of Internal storage and a hefty 8 GB of RAMs compared with the Samsung A53 of 6 GB and Motorola Stylus of 4 GB RAM.  I added a $19.99 Silicon Power 256 GB Micro SD and have it formatted as additional internal storage, resulting in a massive 384 GB storage that will last me a long while.  All APK were restored from Backup except my MOD Music APK ğŸ˜ Android detected and configured the T-Mobile SIM and launch it into 5G mode.  Run Speedtest and it consistently clocked at 750~800 Mbps Download and about 250~300 Mbps Upload.  All APPs run faster than the Motorola.  The Finger sensor built into the Power On/Off button comes in handy to unlock the phone.  The Camera features handy pre-set photo mode such as Portrait, Night scene, Wide-angle, Panorama and Macro shot.  Picture quality with the Samsung GM1 sensor is pretty good for a budget priced phone. WiFi 6 is support is great, since I've WiFi 6 enabled ASUS Mesh network in my house.  The massive 5,000mAh battery last me about 3 days of use and it even comes with Wireless charging found on the more pricy phones.  NFC was something that I really like to have,  now I can load my Credit and Debit card info onto Google pay and use NFC touchless payment at checkout. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the Blu F91 5G phone.  Save more than $250 bucks against the less feature Samsung A53 5G phone.  ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘"
5206,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"It's unreal the power and scope of this phone for the price. I can only laugh at people paying 800+ for 'flagships'. This is phone for people who have more braincells than money, instead of the other way around. Every feature packed, every convenience ready. Strong for gaming, plenty of storage, NFC, fingerprint, wireless charging, and a solid android experience. Has amazing value as well: comes with very comfortable earbuds, screen protector,  wall charger, cable and cleaning cloth. My only 'issue' is that the fingerprint reader will get dirty and will fail to read, this is rare and just needs a quick wipe to clean off, no problem. Outside of that, best phone I have ever owned and got with out an eye watering rip off price!"
5207,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Very solid phone, feels and looks like a high end device. Camera is good, not great. Smooth operation with no lag. If this phone had Samsung, Google or even Motorola on it, it would probably carry a $500-$600 price tag."
5208,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"This is my third BLU phone and the best one yet. This is a long review, but this phone and BLU deserve it  The lcd screen is very clear and bright, even decent in bright sunlight. The camera uses a Samsung sensor and the picture quality may not match a $1,000 phone, but I've been extremely pleased. It has a very good 4x zoom lens, macro pictures come out great, and the night shot setting is very good, but those pictures are a little grainy. The integration of the on-off button and actually a thumb print sensor work perfectly and very fast. Blue tooth pairing and internet pick up are quick and smooth. The 8gb memory, 128gb storage, with an available microsd card holder, a 5000 mamp battery, match or are better than most $500+ phones.  My main reason for buying this phone was waiting for any 5g phone to come out at $300 or less. I still had a BLU g8pro that worked fine, then Amazon sent me an email this phone was on sale for a short time for $199, I bought it that day. I have TMobile service and the 5g speed is fantastic, I've run a number of OOKLA speed tests, with the lowest download speed of 180mbps to a maximum of 710mbps, and that's not a typo. It switches flawlessly from 5g to 4g lte then back to 5g as you move from a 5g tower to one that only supports 4g. I didn't know why this happened, thought it may be the phone, so I called the BLU service support, and got a technician on the phone within minutes. He explained why the switching happened, it isn't the phone, but the strength of 5g as you move from tower to tower.  To  strengthen the reason for this 5g phone, T-Mobile has come out with a 5g internet box for the home and just got one, and am waiting for them to get their tower I am on, to get its operating software loaded. I presently pay $80 a month, and going up, to Spectrum for internet and wifi, the internet service from T-Mobile is $50 a month, first month free, AND you don't have to be a T-Mobile customer to get one. It may sound like I work for T-Mobile, but I don't, but have been a customer for 16 years. This has allowed me to purchase every unlocked phone I've ever owned, from Amazon. And fortunately, with their purchase of Sprint, they have the best 5g coverage of either ATT and Verizon. In summary, I don't think there's a better 5g phone for $300 or less available at this time. It's worth a try, buy it, if it's not for you, you have 30 day's to return it. One thing I forgot, BLU gives you a fast charger, cable, screen protector, AND a very nice case with the phone. A $1,300 I-phone doesn't have any of that for free."
5209,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Phone is great. 5G, good reception compared to my previous (Redmi note 8), and everything works fine. I would buy again for sure, especially at this price point. That said, a couple little problems make it a 4-star. The biggest thing is a design flaw where the volume buttons are directly across from the power button, which is also the fingerprint reader. So if you pick up the phone with one hand and push the power button, you are probably going to push the volume key as well with your opposing thumb. Most phones offset the volume keys higher up presumably so this doesn't occur. The fingerprint reader, too, does ok, but it often takes two or three tries. I think it would just have been better to be on the back rather than trying to integrate it with the power button. So, I can always use face recognition instead I suppose, but that seems so invasive. Oh well. Anyway, the phone is operationally sound, very fast, and a great value. I would buy it again for these reasons, but wish the couple items I mentioned were better thought out."
5210,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,Overall the phone has been pretty good. The finger print sensor takes alittle bit to get used to trying to get your finger in the right spot. The user interface was a bit different then previous phones I have used but once you get used to it it isn't bad.
5211,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,I got this phone over the moto g stylus 5g 2022 because of the 8 gb ram.  I use Google Fi and just put in the sim setup was a breeze.  Did a speed test and was getting constant 200+ mbs.  Screen was good.  Loved all the accessories.  Overall great but...  After 1 week network started to just disappear.  Put in a new sim card but at random no network.  And no way to check or adjust network settings.  Could be out for a minute or several hours.  I considered trying to get a replacement but instead decided to return after I found too many similar reviews.  Great phone poor build quality..  only other complaint is the battery does not last as long as expected.  If you get a good one you will like it.  Again can't rave enough about the accessories in the box.
5212,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"The phone is cool, but I'm not enjoying it as much as I thought I would. I'm going to switch this one for a Samsung. I only got this to upgrade my previous Blu because it kept acting up... but maybe it's just time for me to switch brands. I've enjoyed my Blu venture, but I think it's time for Samsung â€¼ï¸"
5213,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,I just got this and know nothing about it's durability. I will say the apposed volume and power button is annoying as I am constantly muting it without my own knowledge when I hold it. I am replacing a Pixel 4 that got bricked during an update and I don't find this phone any slower or of less quality. I am not on my phone as some are all the time so battery life isn't a concern. Under my normal use I could go 2 days easy without a charge. It comes with the typical bloatware. All in all fine for the money. I say 4 stars for the price point.
5214,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"This phone company is amazing! I just purchased a 5G new one and all 3 phones I own from BLU are amazing. Battery life is off the charts!! I use my phones all day and these keep up. For about $200 ( I bought 2 of the G90 Pro's and now this one), the value is great! I will never buy a phone our service carrier promotes ( samsung,etc). why , these are just as good if not better. Ease of use, design is great. Speed is amazing. Oh, and unlike Apple, samsung $1000 plus phones, these guys throw in a durable phone case! it amazes me that the name brand phones (samsung.apple, LG) cna charge you well over $1000 and not even give at least a good case. the case that came with it is durable and doesn't need replaced. I know some phones come w/ cases that are flimsy, and cheap. Blu is the real deal. And these guys deserve your biz!!!other features, camera is amazing, features are too much list, oh and guess what, it doesn't come loaded with bloat apps like FB,etc and what couple of apps it comes with ( games) you CAN delete and uninstall.Oh and guess what, BLU is made and headquartered right here in the U.S.A !!!!"
5215,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"...and can't be modulated. Also, camera is a bit dysfunctional. If I switch to wide angle lens (i.e., magnification below x1.0) then picture is always underexposed, even with flash on. Variable exposure control in ""Pro"" mode is too hard to access and regulate for backlight compensation, etc. Full-frame dimension (16:9) is not available in wide-angle, portrait, or macro mode (only 4:3).Perhaps most distressing is Blu's lack of camera documentation: I still have no clue about how/when to use some of the ""More"" menu options, e.g., ""108MP"", ""Gif"", ""Intelligent Scanning"". Under settings, there's no explanation about when/how ""anti-flicker"", and ""HDR"", ""AI"" and other menu symbols also aren't defined or explained.User manuals on Blu's website are bare-bones regarding camera functions, leaving the above functions unexplained.Volume control for phone ringer and notification chime is unified; I'd prefer those functions to be separate, so that call ringer could be loud while notification chime be less so.Overall, however, this is a great phone, a huge improvement over my decade-plus-old Galaxy J320a."
5216,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"At the surface the phone looks good, but the little things start to add up. Like how the screen is on all the time, pickup phone to shut screen and the button is so sensitive when putting back down the screen comes back on, that drains the 3 day battery real quick. The mobile connection starts to freeze and I need to reboot system to fix. And the screen rotates and then locks without auto rotate enabled. The phone is okay but I wished I bought a Motorola instead."
5217,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Itâ€™s good phone for basic functions.  Nice large, bright display.  But not for my use due to several limitations.Cannot add a reseller carrierâ€™s GSMT APN.  Contacted BLU who said the supplied should work.  It seems to work but our carrier is reluctant to provide customer service unless their APN is in use on the phone.Do not disturb (DND) mode does not function correctly.  Exceptions such as starred contacts are ignored.  This is a â€˜must haveâ€™ feature for our family.  The â€˜screenshotâ€™ option is missing from the â€˜hold powerâ€™ press.  It's nowhere to be found.  The fingerprint reader is part of the power button on the right side of the phone.  General handling of the phone causes the fingerprint reader to mistake general contact with finder print attempts resulting in â€˜too many attemptsâ€™ errors.  The power button is directly across from the volume buttons on the left side of the phone causing easy accidental pressing of buttons on both sides resulting in unexpected behavior.  I expected WiFi calling to work as my carrier is using the T-Mobile GSMT network.  The option is there, I turned it on, not errors, but doesnâ€™t work.The online manual is useless for anything other than basic functions.  I found this phone very difficult for seniors, like me, to use."
5218,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I've had this phone for about 3 or 4 months now. At first, my only complaint was how heavy the phone is due to the large battery. But as time went on, I came to realize more cons.  But I'll start with the pros: excellent battery life, large screen. 5G works well.Cons: The fingerprint scanner stopped working a couple of weeks after purchase and I could never get it to work again. Facial recognition is hit and miss.  I had to exchange the first phone I had because the phone volume would randomly turn down and the only way I could turn it back up was to reset the whole phone.  The phone freezes sometimes and for the first time ever, last night, the phone got extremely ridiculously hot while charging and I got an alert that the battery is overheating and to let the phone cool off before use.Overall, for the price, it's a decent phone. But I won't be purchasing this brand again. I'm putting this phone in the same class as the TCL 10L - with a price this low, it's best to keep your expectations low as well."
5219,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,I'm a T Mobile customer. So far so good .
5220,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"This phone has been great so far.  This is my third BLU phone.  I break them before they wear out - drop one in water, stepped on another.  The f91 comes with a heavy duty case and a good quality screen protector.  It is nice to have an unlocked phone because it you can change carriers to suit your needs.  The fingerprint reader works as well as the one on the iPhone I have to use for work, the battery charges quickly, and the screen quality is really quite good."
5221,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Well, low price, overall decent phone, durable and most importantly, horrible reception.  I ordered this phone on 10/18/22.  Today is 11/27/22.  I got about a month out of it.  In the first month of owning the phone, I felt like I owned a high end thousand dollar phone.  The phone itself is blazing fast, no lag between switching apps, 5G worked just about everywhere and never had any cellular calls or texts fail.  I'm on the Metro by Tmobile network.  I've never had any issues with any of my previous phones including the one I switched from.  UNFORTUNATLY, over the last week, it is steadily staying in ""Emergency calls only"" mode.  Yes I can use WiFi, but because wifi calling is disabled on this phone, that too isn't an option.  And this isn't just at home or 1 location as it is happening all over the city of Jacksonville, St. Augustine and Daytona.  I'm lucky to get on the Metro network for for than 5 minutes and quickly reply to texts before it goes back to emergency mode.  You can forget about trying to make a phone call.  Majority of the call consists of ""can you hear me?  Hello? - I have spent hours on the phone with tech support and have even gone into a Metro by Tmobile store of which neither could not figure out the phone but they'd be MORE THAN HAPPY TO HELP PICK OUT A NEW PHONE.  Ahem, this is new sir.  Just be cautious when buying this phone.  It's a great phone while it lasts.  I just don't think the quality is where it needs to be to be a successful flagship phone."
5222,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,This is a good budget phone. I purchased it to replace my older samsung galaxy A20. It has very little bloatware and what it does have can be uninstalled. The battery life is decent and for me definitely not 3 days worth. 2 days at most if I push it. It has good camera's and takes decent pics. The 8gb of ram make it a fast phone switching back and forth between apps. 128gb of storage is more than enough for me.The only thing I don't like is the lack of a manual. Having to go through every part of the menu and sub menu to find out how to change things was a bit annoying. There are also some things that I still can't find how to change like shutting off the fast charging.Overall I like the phone and I'm very happy with my purchase.
5223,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Good phone for the money. All the latest features, good camera."
5224,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I've owned a Blu cell phone before. Even though they are slow to update, the phones I've owned were pretty reliable for the price. So far this phone has performed well. I've had this phone for less than a month and I have no complaints at this time."
5225,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"This phone does not have VoLTE so it won't work on EVERY GSM carrier.  I had to switch from Simple Mobile to Mint.  While trying to get mint going, the mint app said that the sim card and the ACT code didn't match. I had to call mint customer service, who got it working. will add to this review as needed.  edit-It's functioning well with mint."
5226,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I got this phone when I lost my phone and it was affordable. Started using it on the 10th of November. it worked well for a bit but recently it's not reading fingerprint on first try, system UI keep crashing and the screen is very sensitive. It's an ok phone for when you're in a bind, but I don't think I'll enjoy using it."
5227,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,Seems to have a lot of bugs that needs fixing. I bought the phone ğŸ“± bcuz of the features u get for the price. But a couple of days after getting it I had to factor reset it bcuz it was acting all weird and kept freezing up constantly. So I did that a few days later again Bcuz of same issues. Now i have to restart it every time I charge it or don't use it for a couple of hours. I should've sent it back within the first 30 days but I thought maybe a update would fix it. But nope made it a Lil better but just a little bit.ğŸ¤¦ğŸ¿â€â™‚ï¸ğŸ˜”. Should've splurged a few more $$ and got a Samsung.ğŸ¤¦ğŸ¿â€â™‚ï¸ğŸ¤·ğŸ¿â€â™‚ï¸. You live & learn
5228,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"This is a simple review for people who wanna know simply would I recommend to buy. Yes. The phone is great quality and performance for the price by far. The only cons I think most people would notice right away is the cameras are mediocre at best compared to more modern phones. However these are usable. Not great but fine. Other than that, I don't see much difference between this and most mid range smartphones in performance. I'd definitely recommend this as a simple cheap Android phone for anyone on GSM networks! I could daily this phone, but going with my iphone 13 if I want photos that don't look like they were taken on a toaster oven. Hahahah. The screen is quite nice and battery holds well. Bluetooth no issues. Wifi and cellular worked right away on t-mobile, phones specs are accurate in CPU x tester. Really impressive for the price point, I've bought phones for 380-400$ that were less powerful and updated. It's definitely something to look into.Edit : I took this device on a trip to the mountains and it can take some pretty nice photos in full daylight. I feel like in nice sunny outdoor lighting it's performance via camera isn't to bad , but indoors or in very low light it's still not it. Just wanted to add this because I slammed the camera earlier.Edit 2: this phone has been so reliable for me. It has worked on every network I've tried it on. Works with my Verizon sim, with T-Mobile as well. The headphone jack has now come in handy!!!!I would say this phone has little to no bugs, more reliable than the pixel 6 pro I just got when it comes to not having bugs. Connection on here is just made easier. Big props to blu.Enjoy ur new phone if u decide to buy :)"
5229,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I hate having to take a full star away for my petty dislikes.  Beautiful phone that feels very well made, but like others say, don't expect to get three days on the battery. I fully charged mine at noon, transferred data from my old phone, and used it a little in the afternoon.  By 6:30 it had 13% battery left. The touchscreen is huge, so I tend to bump things I don't want to, but that's just me.  My only other issue is the case. The case covers the volume controls so I'll have to figure out how to notch that out. And the back of the phone is so pretty I hate to cover it!"
5230,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Was a fan of BLU, left years back.  Couldn't deal with their compromise phase...big battery, below avg memory/RAM.  Liked the look and stats on this phone, price reasonable, came back to BLU.  Not impressed, not even happy.  Intermittent signal issues and screen jitter.  Back to my old phone while looking for a replacement."
5231,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I've come from using some of the biggest names in the cell phone industry.  When I seen this phone, I read quite a few reviews and decided to try it.  So here's my first impressions of the BLU F91 5G as a daily driver.After unboxing the phone feels of nice quality it doesn't feel cheap.  I really like the Blue color.  After I was able to get everything loaded I was able to really play with this devices settings and check out it's performance.  The screen is nice and makes this phone look more expensive than it really is.  Only 60 hz refresh rate.  Overall, the usual usage of social and media content is good.  I also performed a network speed test on my TMobile network.  I'm seeing about 250 download and about 40 upload, which isn't too bad.  Web pages seem to load as quick as the big name brands.  Call quality is nice and clear.  I believe that this phone doesn't support wifi calling.  So overall at $230 its pretty good. Now, for the short comings.One of my biggest gripes is the audio is a single speaker and it's not the loudest and the sound is a little thin.  It's not terrible but could have been better. On my media player I was able to adjust the EQ to tailor in some better sound which helped a little bit. Stereo speakers here would've really helped this device.  The other short coming of this device is the charging speed.  While in use the phone takes FOREVER to top off from about 60% with the included 18 watt charging brick.  BLU should've upped the charging speed to a minimum of 30 watt charge. Obviously when not in use it will charge faster.  Wireless charging is also included with this phone.  I like the fact that you can set it on the charging pad and got to bed, and it will be fully charged in the morning.  Wifi calling would have been a nice addition.  If Blu would have offered this device with these 3 other options, I believe they would've had a phone that wouldve been at the top of the midrange phones rivaling some flagship devices.In conclusion, the Blu F91 5g is a budget phone that targets midrange phones costing 2 times as much.  The hardware is pretty good for the $$$.  I'm going to make my decision here in the next day or 2 to keep it or return it.  I want to give the device a fair shake.  I'll edit this post if anything else positive or negative come up with the phone.Edit: My Blu f91 data stopped loading web pages.  I went in and reset network settings and that fixed the issue.  Then I had to reset network settings again.  Then again the day after that.  It seems to be a software or hardware issue, so I decided to return the device.  It's a shame, because I had high hopes for the device and I really kinda liked it.  Demoted to 1 star."
5232,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"This was supposed to be an upgrade to my older Blu phone (Vivo XL6). The only thing it seems to have that is better than my older Blu is this one is 5G where my older one is only 4G. The ring volume of this phone is pathetic!!! You can barely hear it on full volume and sitting right next to it.  The same goes for all the sound volumes in general. It's super hard to hear calls and hard to hear if your watching a video. But hey, it does take decent pictures. So I guess there's that. I'm just really hoping this doesn't turn out to be a $230 waste of money."
5233,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"This phone is a suboptimal phone, and waste of money. The Blu G90 is a much better phone. This phone will not connect to wifi and freeze's up a lot. I hated that other people that say me with it though it was a good phone, and bought it. Too crappy for me."
5234,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I am very pleased with this phone.  I don't play games or watch movies on my phone, so I don't know how long the battery charge would last if I did, but the battery lasts well for days without a charge.  When I do charge it, it recharges very fast."
5235,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"First, I don't always need the latest, greatest, most expensive devices out there because most of us never use our electronic devices to their full capacity (think about your laptop). When looking to replace my aging S7 Galaxy (I've had it for 7 years), I wanted an unlocked phone.  I did a lot of reading and BLU always peaked my interest. First, the cost. At $249, I was on the hook.  Second, the features. Everything you could ask for in a phone. Android 11/12/13...doesn't concern me.  Third, expandible memory. I also added a 256 GB SD card to my handset. That, plus the 128 GB internal and 8GB Ram is plenty. Especially when you back everything up to either Google Drive/One or another cloud based storage.  Fourth, I like the size. It is a bit bigger than my old S7, but that is a plus for me. Bigger viewing screen and battery life.All in all, this phone is all that I wanted and more.  And, the company is based out of Miami, not Korea, China or any other non-U.S. country.  When you look at the price, you think how much you are getting ripped off by Samsung and Apple. How much is there phone really worth? $800, $1000? I think not. I just wished I didn't miss out on the $199 introductory price."
5236,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I want to mention that this is my third BLU phone. My first BLU phone is a BLU V9 (G8) that I bought few years ago on BB. My mom still using with a last security update june 2021(I just change battery). My second BLU phone was the Bold N1(bought directly from BLU website). Died the first year of use and never received the android update promised. Now the review of this BLU F91.Pros:NFC5g8giga Ram - fast and fluid (not laggy)headphone JackSD card storageAlmost pure androidWireless ChargingGreat battery capacityunlockedYes it's a LCD screen but is bright and looks great for the price.Cons:Android 11 (not 12) and maybe not upgradable ( I read in their FB page this phone will have 2 years upgrade- but who knows ... mmm...Bold N1, never received the promise upgrade)Camera- below of averagesound- one speaker = not loud.The few bloatware (mostly games) comes every time you restart the phone.No double tap to wake the phone (I personally love this feature in my others phone).Some random problems with app and the internet.It's a good phone for $249 or less. If you are in TMobile and want to spend $300 buy the OnePlus Nord N20."
5237,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"All the features such as face recognition, fingerprint reader, and battery life are great ... but, if you are used to pushing the power button just to check the time, your phone unlocks which becomes annoying. Also be aware that it does not work with AT&T or Verizon. It does work with T-Mobile."
5238,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,I really like this phone but it is 4G not a 5G like it was supposed to be. But I do like the phone. Battery lasts all day long! Shipping was fast as usual.
5239,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Overall it's a good phone, main negatives are the ridiculous size and weight!  It's like carrying a tablet in your pocket... My previous phone (a TCL) was light and much smaller and had better battery life.  This one will use 30-40% with Bluetooth and Spotify running for 8-10 hours.  The fingerprint reader/power button is annoying, it almost always recognizes the fingerprint but with it also being the power button you will unlock the phone when you just want to check the time or temp, would be better located on the back of the phone like most other phones.I picked this phone for to the low cost for a full feature 5g phone.  But it is barely faster than the 4g phones I've had previously so it feels like a waste of money..."
5240,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Many testimonies of ""WI-FI CALLING"" on this board are mis-leading and neither Blu nor Amazon seem to care to clarify this in the front-facing product specs.  True WI-FI Calling should be specifically enabled on the phone and should display a ""WIFI Calling"" icon at the top of your phone when enabled.  You can call over Wi-FI via an app like WhatsApp, but that is not a product feature, that is an app feature.  I tried SIMS with multiple carriers (MINT and TELLO), and neither work on WI-FI Calling with the BLU F91 5G phone - because the phone is NOT WI-FI Calling capable.  However, both of these SIMS/Services work on other phones with true WI-FI Calling (I tried iPhone 7, iPhone 8, and Samsung 5 for each MINT and TELLO).  I think it is embarrassing that Blu pushes a 5G phone with so many features and buries the fact it doesn't have a common expected capability.  Now I am overseas and I had to load my SIM card into an iPhone 8 so people can actually call me from the US (without going through a shared app).  Oh, and the 5G worked like crap on the F91 ""5G"" as well.  I had to default to 4G as it was totally dysfunctional when auto-switching down from 5G signal.  This is my second Blu phone, bought two Blu phones in the past for my kids prior as well.  I totally got suckered into thinking this one had WI-Fi Calling.  So, this was my last Blu phone."
5241,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"I cannot give 5 stars because I read another reviews where they say it is compatible with US Mobile Super LTE offered by Verizon, but I don't know for which reason my new F91 it's not compatible. I checked with the online tool both IMEI's (this phone has two sim slots) and also chatting with an agent, the result is NOT COMPATIBLE. For the rest the phone is great."
5242,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,This phone is fast and has phenomenal battery life and performance for the cost!
5243,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"This is my second Blu phone I have purchased. I really like these phones because they are easy to operate, have great features, are fast, lots of storage, and take great pictures. For the money, you get a very solid phone that lasts. I will continue to be a Blu customer as long as their product stays a quality product for a person on a budget!"
5244,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"Pros:1) Fast, really fast2) Great battery life3) The box has everything you will need - charging brick, usb cable, case, tempered glass screen protectorCons:The volume from the earpiece is extremely low. Even when using headphones, the volume doesn't improve.I only meant to use this as a backup phone, but even for occasional calls, this won't do. So has to go back."
5245,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,This is the third one that I have purchased love this phone but unfortunately this phone had some connectivity issues the others didn't so I am going to get another this phone is a flagship phone at a decent price five stars Amazon and Blu phone f 91 5g
5246,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,The battery life is pretty good with this phone.
5247,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,"It skips, freezes up when I'm trying to send a message. The keyboard shows up then it goes out. Have to wait forever to go from one step to the next. The list is endless. Shame on you people to sell this phone!"
5248,BLU,F91 5G,128 GB,Android 11,6.8 Inches,A very peppy phone. It took jus a few minutes to unpack and get it up an running. At $230 it gives you a lot for your money. I've followed Blue since they came out with their first phone but this is the first I've owned. So far I really like it. Very speedy. Camera is good so far. You should definitely consider it next time you're in the market for a phone.
5249,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"Have been using Android over 10 years and carrying Pixels the last 4 years. Love stock Android. I don't usually buy phones at launch, but I caved this year. Don't care about the camera, but if this is important for you, look no further. Like it's predecessors, this phone takes nice photos. Cool design, premium feel, and a modestly updated feature set. Android is still Android after all. The phone does feel good in your hand. Screen is very nice and the 90hz refresh is noticeably smooth. If you've been reading reviews, you've probably read all this elsewhere.I do want to like this phone and am going to give it a chance, but I'm going to be merciless if the device doesn't stand up to reasonable everyday use. What do I mean by this? We bought two phones but I've only opened one of them to evaluate. Set up was easy. Connect your devices and less than 10 min later, everything was transferred. Apps installed, then they updated. Ready for testing. WiFi and Bluetooth connection were fast and solid.One thing I was quite impressed with was the sound. After using earlier pixels with front firing speakers I was a little worried. Nothing to worry about here. Sound quality is very good (full and rich), and the gesture navigation skip forward and back worked for me as well, boom!  4K videos looked good and so did ones shot in 1080p.Face unlock. This was another ""on the fence"" item for me. Cool feature and it works, but now they have it all. Our fingerprints from the last generation of phones can now be linked with our faces. Works perfectly in pitch black darkness.  Infrared wins.I still have the same (major) concerns as others. The 2800mah battery is tiny. I am extremely skeptical here, but hope I can be proven wrong. No unlimited original res photo storage. I know Google is in business to make money, but what a chump thing to do. It's right up there with them not including a headphone adapter or headphones this time around. So this is the price you pay or accessories you forego to have the latest tech. I believe this could have been done better or differently. It's a flagship phone, or at least that's what Google is calling it. Congrats Google, you've cut just about every corner you possibly could with this device.What's next. Let's see how the device performs in real day-to-day usage. In the car, in a pocket with Bluetooth and the normal stuff we all do with our devices. The TINY subpar battery had better be good. Otherwise 2 of these phones are coming right back to you.My suggestion, if you didn't jump on the launch deal is WAIT. The phone is nice, but the potential for disappointment is there. Black Friday and Christmas are just around the corner too.***Update Daily useCall and audio quality is good, using a BT headset also good. Streaming music to the cars audio system working well. Android 10 has a few quirks, but is working and very stable.  I haven't had any performance issues with the device or its OS.  Although I had WiFi calling on my 3XL (AT&T) , it will not activate on this device. May I have to call them to see why.***Update after 3 weeks of ownershipWhile I am fully sold on the Face Unlock feature, I still miss the finger print reader.  Its just something you become used to after years of pixel ownership.  I've only caught myself trying to unlock the phone about 3 times with my finger.  I set up face unlock without glasses, but it works when I put on reading glasses, and also while wearing sun glasses (that one is amazing).  One thing people and (google) haven't thought of.  Currently, Face Unlock works even your eyes are closed.  Google has said they are going to release an update that addresses this.  Ok, so what happens when I'm wearing sunglasses?Trusted Devices or Places will probably address this.  My phone stays unlocked in the car and at home or work.  But if you are outside walking around and wearing sun glasses, you might have to PIN into the device or lift your sunglasses.  This is still an unknown I guess.I called AT&T and we determined the IMEI of the phone was not ""whitelisted"" on their network.  Hence the reason why I couldn't activate Wi-Fi calling.  It took them 3 days, but they re-provisioned the SIM (remotely) and added the ID.  Wi-Fi Calling works now.  If you have this problem with a new phone (any brand) that is compatible with voLTE and Wi-Fi calling, but was not purchased through your carrier (subsidy) there is always a possibility that the phone will not be ""whitelisted"".  You have to call customer care and be really nice.  I got lucky the first time I called, sometimes it takes more than one call.  The second device (other P4) which is also with AT&T (but a different plan) will not allow Wi-Fi to be activated either, so this means another call to the carrier.  Hand off between Cellular and Wi-Fi or vice versa works 98% of the time.  I've had a few dropped calls say when I'm walking into work or the house and the phone transitions from Cellular to Wi-Fi.  Mostly however, it works and is stable.  For those who have had Google Fi, you'll know exactly what I am talking about.  Wi-Fi calling capable devices attempt to switch aggressively whenever they can move voice calls to Wi-Fi.The new Google Assistant is very good.  The AI they have built into the core of the OS is impressive.  Not needing a cellular or Wi-Fi connection to use it makes it extremely fast.  For me, this is probably the most notable upgrade from a Android/hardware perspective.BIGGEST concern >> the 2800mah battery.  Remarkably, the phone lasts all day and well into the next morning without being charged.  I had concerns about going to sleep with a low battery and having the phone die during the night and then no alarm in the morning.  Well, it hasn't been a problem.  I typically have 17-30% percent remaining in the morning and can easily throw the phone on charge before leaving the house.  I have the ""always on"" display turned on, and allow all notifications to display on my lock screen.  I have gesture navigation enabled which keeps the soli radar chip active and looking for gestures above the device when its stationary.  I stream videos and play music over Bluetooth in the car.  I also use navigation when walking frequently.  Normal use and the battery has held up well.  This is really a matter of personal preference and your usage.  Initial reviews said 3-4 hrs of screen time should be expected.  I'm getting 5-6hrs.  If you are on your phone for hours a day, or play games, get the XL.In closing, I have found myself >>inconvenienced<< more than once since the phone did not come with a USB-C to 3.5mm headphone adapter.  I have headphones, but have been left to work one handed because I don't have my BT headset with me.  Google > BIGGEST CHUMP MOVE EVER.  Really pissed me off.  I've ordered one.  Tired of the inconvenience.With that said, my original recommendation stands.  If you cannot buy the P4 or XL at a serious discount, WAIT.  It is not worth the full retail price, regardless of the new ""features"".  Its over priced for what you get, and Google has cut way too many corners seriously detracting from the value you receive vs. cost of the device at full price.  Still 64GB of storage, small 2800mah battery, no adapters, no headphones, no unlimited full res photo storage..  Other people have said this too.  Google has had several chances to build and release good devices.  They just can't get it right.  You pay for a flagship and there is always a compromise.  In the case of the P4, its one after another.***Final Update 6 weeks of ownership.I am enjoying the phone and it's working as I intended.  I had Android 10 on my 3XL so no surprises there.  As usual Google continues to improve and refine it's OS.  Everything just works.  This is why I buy Pixels.While I like the phone, this years Pixels did not wow me like those of previous years.  It's a phone, it's running the latest version of Android but that's about it.The new AI built into the Google Assistant remains the most noteable ""feature"" from an upgrade perspective for me. But like before, that's it.  The premium price tag is just disproportional to the value you are receiving.I am a fan of Android, but this year Apple and OnePlus nailed it from a hardware perspective.  Cost to value ratio.  They came through where you (Google) failed. The P4 isn't even 2 months old and most carriers are practically giving them away.  Not to mention Google has substantially increased trade in values for older devices to entice new buyers.Which leads me to ask..  Google are you giving up on Pixel?  Does this mean Samsung and OnePlus devices for everyone next year.  Man you guys got some black eyes this year.  All avoidable too.I can say this.  Nice phone, but I won't buy your device at launch next year.  Everyone, I urge you to heed these words.  Do not pay full price for this device.  I'm not saying don't buy it, but don't buy it at full price."
5250,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"When the new Pixel 4 was released I took a look at my two-year-old Pixel 2 and wondered if I really needed to upgrade, given what a great phone it had been, and still is. Giving in to a bit of retail therapy is easy, so I did.It's an expensive business getting a Pixel phone in this country (New Zealand) since it's a buy from Amazon in the US, shipping to the other end of the world, paying GST (our sales tax) converted to NZ dollars added up to $1,550.Was it worth it? Let's take a look.** Edit: After nearly a year, I just love this phone, absolutely rock-solid even with over a hundred apps installed, I'm revising from 4 to 5 stars **I've owned a lot of android phones and had the Pixel 4 for a few months now and it's performed pretty much flawlessly, both the software and the hardware - as I expected it would. I really like Google's own implementation of their Android O/S - it's clean and just works. There are some UI annoyances that I'll come to later. Other makes (Huawei, Samsung) all seem to be clogged up with unnecessary and buggy extra apps and take years to get Android updates through. I get Google's updates within days of release and I've never had a bad one.In their attempt to regain a handful of pixels from the bottom of the screen, Google have removed the Home and Back on-screen buttons and replaced them with gestures. This has or will probably occur on other makes of phone as Android 10 rolls out. The new gesture needs a swipe from the bottom edge (home) or from either side (back), and I pretty much hate it. ** Edit: You can turn that off and now I like it **If you miss the edge (it's tricky if you have a case with a raised edge) then you end up swiping the app off to somewhere unwanted. If you get a bit close to the edge when you're scrolling within an app, you suddenly go home or back. It doesn't happen to me very often but when it does happen it's infuriating. Hint: When buying a case, look for one with a low profile on the screen side - though that won't protect the screen quite as well.As for other features, I'm not so sure there's a lot to say. The main one is the face recognition lock which I've turned on and also the ""Keep phone unlocked while I'm looking at it"" option. I like that one, it saves the phone going black when I'm taking my time reading, or something. It's also nice to just pick up the phone and look at it, it's so natural, quick and easy. People seem unduly worried about the security of this feature, I'm not sure why except maybe for the unlock while you're asleep. If someone is in a position to do that, then they are also in a position to do many awful things to me and additionally, the banking and other vulnerable stuff on my phone has a further level of security.The screen is up to par, and the glass is nice not picking up oily finger goop like all my others did after a while. I've given up on screen protectors, my phones are pretty safe being mostly in my pocket, and I like the feel of the screen. Feels like a solid build to me without being too heavy, though it's heavier than the Pixel 2 and has quite a bit more screen, mostly in the length.People seem to rave about the camera and I agree it's good, but so was the Pixel 2 so the step up doesn't seem huge to me - but then I'm no camera buff. The Pixel 2 was a bit better at close-ups which I do a lot of when working with electronics. The Pixel 4 can be zoomed up to 8x but can't focus closer than about 120mm which limits its use as a macro camera. The P2 was good down to about 60mm. (4.7"" and 2.4"")Sound is surprisingly good watching a video. There's nothing at the bass end but that's to be expected in such a small body. The volume is good and the sound spread is wide though perhaps a bit overdone. I'm not in a cathedral. I regularly use speakerphone and also Sennheiser Bluetooth headphones, and they perform very well on both phone calls and music. Bluetooth, WiFi, and 4G connectivity all seem solid.Battery life is marginal, my only real complaint about the hardware. An overnight charge to 100% would all be gone by 7pm if I wasn't quite careful. To counter this I bought a charger for the car so I can give it a commute-time top-up and things are better now. Wireless charging is cool and Qi chargers all seem to work fine. Makes charging in the car a breeze with a charger built into the holder. Wireless charging is not fast, about 0.9 amps, compared to a fast charger which charges at nearly 3 amps (~1 hr full charge time) but it turns the phone into a hotplate and could affect battery life.I recently bought a Samsung Galaxy Active 2 Smartwatch (SM-R810) and paired it up easily with the Pixel via Bluetooth, but with a fair amount of convoluted messing about with the Samsung apps got it all working reasonably well though it's a bit crazy and somewhat buggy. I sure wish Samsung would produce practical software like Google does. I did a review on the watch too.So was it worth it? Probably not, but mostly because my old Pixel 2 was such a nice reliable workhorse that has never slowed down even with 150 or so apps. Every other phone I ever owned has slowly ground to a standstill. I use quite a lot of apps.Am I glad I bought it? For sure, but I just can't part with the Pixel 2 so now that one's a spare."
5251,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"It sucks that they don't allow for reviews on the official Google website, but this phone isn't the greatest. If you buy it from Amazon, you'll get it within a week, but if you buy it from the Google store it could take literal months. The software freaks out randomly at times, but restarting usually fixes it. If you're buying this phone, you're buying it for the camera quality, otherwise you should find something else. I probably won't buy another Pixel after this."
5252,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"Leaks and early reviews made people know what was coming and the few details we were missing were a disappointment. Google justifies that a telephoto it's more useful than an ultra wide but when you are joining the big league of flagships you give customers the options that the market offers and in this case I think that the wide angle omission was a big miss. This and the surprise of a smaller battery compared to last year's pixel are the drawbacks that I wanted to get out of the way first.The battery is not great as people expected and on my two day use, I have had around 4 hours of screen on time. I feel like this is making a big favor to goole, and in no way this is a justification, but my smaller battery has made me rethink that probably being on my phone for 4 hours and being stressed about it is probably something I could improve and adjust on my personal time management. Normal phone use with camera use every once in a while is achievable for sure with the regular pixel 4. For me the trade-off of a smaller battery but a more manageable body compared to the XL is worth it.To combat the lack of wide angle, I luckily had a moment wide angle lens I used on my pixel 2 that I did not get rid off when I got my S10e. I can confidently say the convenience of having the lens on the phone is great, but in case of the Samsung lens the quality dropped from the main lens to the wide angle and using the awesome lens from moment doesn't decrease the quality or adds any distortion to the main lens. Having moment announce the support of the Pixel 4 gives me a wide angle and basically convert my two lens to the ideal 3 lens scenario we all wanted. I seriously recommend the products and content Moment has to anyone interested in photography.Now for the good stuff, Pixel 4 shines in what I expected and made me come back for a pixel. I went from Nexus 6p- Samsung s8 and Pixel 2 - Samsung s10 and both times I kept missing my Google phone. If rellying on a camera that will ALWAYS deliver a great photo is something you value, I don't think there is a better option than Pixel. It's more difficult to take a bad photo than it is to take GREAT one. The lack of original quality cloud backup is a bit sour, but you can still back them on a good enough quality, considering most people just like to go back and see their photos on their phones and not for a big print out where amazing quality is required. The price of Google one is also reasonable and gives enough space for original quality backup.Lastly, the screen and 90hz screen are the cherry on top of this cake. If you use your phone, you need to unlock it so having something that makes this process go this smooth because of the early waking up of the phone  from the radar to scan for your face it's really wonderful. The 90hz helps on another side of our everyday use equation : scrolling CONSTANTLY. The difference is noticeable and it's something I know I will get used to. As with many other things and features, it's one of the little things techlovers appreciate and other consumers just don't care about.There is no perfect phone but Pixel constantly proved for me that there's no match for their camera and having the best Android experience is what you get. With this year's Pixel 4 you get that plus an awesome clean and finally finger print free construction, a superb pair of speakers that do not make me miss the front firing speakers of the Pixel 2 and some nifty features that scratch my geek technology itch."
5253,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"The screen has horizontal lines across it as if it was somehow damaged. The phone itself works just fine, but there's definitely something off with the display."
5254,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"Background:  As with many other aspects of my life, I am not a typical user so please read this review with that in mind.  I am a heavy music listener, spending a lot of time listening to music in a car or at work listening over bluetooth headphones, take lots of pictures and in any other respect mostly use the phone for texting, calling, Teams, Outlook, OneDrive, multi-factor authentication, web browsing and e-book reading.  I bought this phone unlocked but I have been a Verizon customer for well over a decade.  I went for almost 4 years with the Samsung S8 without any issues.  Towards the end, the battery was starting to give out and I was over the quality of the camera in it since I rely on that feature heavily in my work.  Unfortunately, I should have done more research than I did (though I see plenty of reviews that still praise its virtues).  I think it all comes down to what you're going to use it for (tell me something I don't know, right?).The camera is as solid as others describe.  Night Sight is actually pretty cool and produces quality pictures even in low lighting without the obscenity of a flash.  Pictures taken in normal settings are true to color and sharp.  Love the Google Lens feature that allows it to identify text in pictures so I can track FedEx packages or just copy a MAC address from a pic instead of typing it out.  I couldn't ask for more out of a cell phone camera.  Never had issues with apps for checking mail, instant messaging, browsing or third party app use.  Face recognition was just about perfect unless it was in the zone of trying to authenticate me with a PIN (it would do that occasionally and would not let me unlock by face) or I was wearing a mask.  (Damn you, 2020!)But at what cost to my peace of mind?  At $650 paid up front, it shouldn't be like this.  There are several idiosyncrasies this phone has that just drove me crazy:What gives with the battery life?  - There were days where the battery would regular slip down fairly quickly to nothing and other days where it withstood my usage valiantly.  I played with the battery settings and app settings on a regular basis but could find no rhyme or reason why the battery life performed worse on some days and better on others.Screen brightness - If you read pro reviews for this phone, you'll see them complain that the brightest display setting is only adequate in bright light environments.  That is actually pretty on the mark.  If you mess with the phone's auto-detection of ambient light, beware.  It will keep that setting and you may find yourself looking at a very dark screen when you need to know which freeway exit to take.  Or it will go bright and eat away mercilessly at your battery.  The term auto-brightness with this phone is to be taken with a grain of salt.Thumbnails?  What are those? - Another little issue that made me grit my teeth is the lack of thumbnail support when browsing your pictures using File Explorer.  You cannot see picture previews if the pics are on your phone and you are using a computer to view them.  Does.  Not.  Work.  You must view the pics on the phone by date and either open them one by one or copy them off to your computer whereupon the thumbnail function will once again miraculously work.  Apparently a Pixel speciality.Weird texting issues - occasionally, my text messages to certain users would start timing out and would never work again unless I either a) deleted the entire conversation with that contact or b) delete the contact and text to the phone number instead.  Not a dealbreaker, but certainly annoying when no other phone I've owned has ever had this kind of glitch.Smart Gestures - Switching tracks by moving your hand was sketchy at best.  It would often misinterpret shifting gears or touching the car's screen as a request to switch tracks.  I couldn't keep the squeeze features enabled because when turned OFF  the phone would pause music tracks or the Bluetooth connection would start freaking out when I held the phone's edges too firmly.  Turning that feature on just invited madness in.  I have screen attention turned on, but that doesn't stop it from going to sleep anyway and that's without battery saver mode turned on!  The only smart sense I appreciated was the SHH feature of flipping the phone over to put it into do not disturb mode.Bluetooth issues - This is certainly not the death knell for this Google offering but more like the last straw for me.  About a week ago, I installed PowerAmp to listen to local tracks since Amazon Music has issues when selecting tracks that aren't in the cloud or doesn't detect them altogether...  or it was this PHONE!  (Don't think I don't suspect you, you pos!)  Recall how above I complained that the smart gesture function to move tracks didn't work?  Although it was working fine before, suddenly the artist and track info no longer get transmitted from my Pixel to my car AND I can't use the car's touch screen to skip or rewind tracks.  I have to start playing with my phone while driving now to either find out what I'm listening to or change tracks.  How is this progress and concern for public safety?  I can't use Alexa because my music is so loud, I would have to pause it first to talk to the phone.  I tested this with my iPad and song track and forward / backward functionality work fine.The solution, I'm afraid is to pack up this phone, trade it in and get another Samsung, which I'm doing."
5255,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"I spent a few weeks researching phones and ended up going for this one. Did the new release and pre-order deal inform that decision? Certainly. But that wasn't the only factor, and after 2 days, I have no buyer's remorse (yet).The contents of the box are basic - you get a charging cable and a USB port to allow the transfer of data from your old phone, and that's it. No headphones, no dongle, no USB-C to USB cable.The phone is simple, elegant, and light. And that last is not insignificant. Among flagship phones, it's one of the smallest and lightest around, and it fits very neatly in my pocket with minimal bulk. In fact, it's been some time since I had a phone I could comfortably leave in the pocket of my pants while sitting down.The interface is smooth and fast, and while there may be slightly better screens on the more expensive flagship models, it's plenty sharp enough for me. Motion sense it is a bit of a gimmick at this stage - not many app use it yet and it isn't 100% reliable, but it's nice to be able to vaguely waft at my alarm in the morning to snooze it. It just takes less mental energy at a time when my mental energy reserves are at their lowest. It's been reliable enough so far.Another cool new feature is live caption - instant subtitles on any media the phone is playing. I tested this while watching a Thursday Night Football NFL game, and it worked well enough. The feed was a little slow and occassionally struggled with names (Case Keenum was regularly referred to as case kingdom and Stefon Diggs confused it no end, but it got most of the other names right). I often stream football with the volume off and will make good use of this feature.The main event, though, is the camera, and it doesn't disappoint. Yes, there's no wide angle lens, but the basic camera is fairly wide already. If you want full field-of-view that distorts the edges and the verticals, then maybe an iPhone11 is better, but early tests seem to vindicate Pixel's decision to go for 'telephoto' (2x zoom) instead - the zoom is excellent and the portrait mode blows most of the competition out of the water.  Images are sharp, colors are represented well and the software allows you to achieve a finer finish than anyone should really expect from the sort of lens and sensor a phone can carry. The photos added to this review show night sight, 8x zoom on the staute of liberty, and a couple of pictures using portrait mode (my cat, and a macro style photo which might be my favouite so far)Battery life is generally listed as the biggest negative of the Pixel 4, but it's been fine for me. I did reduce the frame refresh rate to 60Hz and put it on dark mode (Makes no real difference to me anyway). With those changes, I was able to do 1 hour web surfing, stream an hour of video, spend 1 hour reading an e-book, plus half and hour taking photos, and half an hour listening to music over bluetooth, and at the end of the day I still had 28% battery left. All around, fairly comfortable. If you're not a high-intensity user and you're happy with dark mode and a normal refresh rate, battery shouldn't be a deal breaker.Overall, I wanted a small, light phone with an excellent camera. Now, I have one."
5256,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"So far after just a week I am going to stay with 5 stars.  If that changes I will update the review.  Its not perfect, but overall the good outweighs the bad.  So here are my notes.Its the only Android I would consider because of security and Google updates.  I would only ever buy an unlocked Apple or a Google phone - where the software vendor pushes the updates every month.  Otherwise I'm not interested.  If you buy another Android phone good luck getting major OS upgrades or even security patches.First, all the nitpicks about battery life: Yeah, its a small phone.  Its not like Google put in a small battery just to mess with you.  So far, it seems about the same as my Pixel 3 to me: just ok.  Unless you work mostly in the wilderness its not really an issue just top off during the day occasionally. (I hike a lot in the wilderness, and I carry a battery pack for those times).  So if you need guaranteed all day battery life buy the XL.OK that aside, its a bit faster than my Pixel 3.  I noticed one web page in particular that is grossly javascript heavy would load very slowly on my pixel 3 and is much faster on my 4.Iâ€™m not a huge fan of the face unlock so far.  The old fingerprint reader worked better for me most of the time â€“ you could unlock it as you picked it up.  Now I have to wait till I look at it.  But I got over that.  Its not bad either, and occasionally its better â€“ Lastpass for example, unlocks itself.And heh, lets get real about the flaw that you can have your eyes closed.  They plan to fix this, and its really not much less secure than a fingerprint as is.  If you are sleeping or dead either one can be bypassed,.The size if just right I donâ€™t want a giant phone.Likewise gestures took a bit of practice.  I hate Iphones because of the no back button problem; now I donâ€™t have one either.  There is a swipe gesture instead, but its a little slower and less reliable than the old way.  Still, I am resisting the temptation to enable the back button so far.The dual sim capability is amazing!  I keep a Google Fi eSim onboard with Visible (Verizon MVNO) as my main carrier.  The Pixel 4 does a dramatically better job of managing dual sims and either number rings now.Most of all I appreciate the Google commitment to privacy and security.  (I could care less how many times they market my web history to advertisers, it doesnâ€™t compromise my security.)I am disappointed I no longer get free full resolution camera uploads but can live with the free high resolution.And really, no earbuds included?  Although I am very happy not to have the antiquated headphone jack and I have the google earbuds leftover from previous pixels which are great.I appreciate Amazon having the black Friday sale price of $599 and an extended return period in case it dies!So this phone is a keeper for me.  Iâ€™ve had almost every Google phone ever made going back to day 1, and they just get a bit better with each iteration."
5257,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"The phone came with a generic box and generic charger, and it's amazing! The battery life is not so great (I knew this before buy it) but is in very good shape, I'd say almost 100% of capacity. Overall the phone is excellent and I'm looking forward to buy other phones to this seller. Very nice!PD: No bootloader unlockable."
5258,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,Lo comprÃ© para mi viaje a Europa . Excelente! Puedes ponerle chip o tarjeta esim. Funciona genial. La cÃ¡mara es extraordinaria! Me encanta!
5259,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,I bought it for my mom .itâ€™s not too big not or too small phone. Really nice one.
5260,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"Overall this is a great phone.  Some highlights:* Great size, comfortable in my hand, can be used one handed* The little features like squeeze to access Google assistant or wave your hand over it to silence alarms are really nice* It's very fast.  The only phone I've used that was slightly faster was the S20, but the pixel 4 is almost instantaneous with everything* Stock Android is better than any other UI I've used (other than Nova launcher UI)* Battery life gets dinged in reviews, but I actually think it's great, and usually reviewers are comparing it to phones that are physically bigger.  Yes, you can fit bigger batteries in bigger phones, but if you want a phone of this size, it has good battery life.  It's twice as good as my old Samsung S7 was.* The face recognition to unlock works great and is easier than using things like fingerprint scans or pin codes* Google provides great supportThe bad:* The phone is really picky about chargers.  It charges slow on all my wireless chargers, stops charging partway through the night on some charging pads, won't charge with certain cords, etc.  Update: buy the Yootech F500 wireless charger!  It reliably fast charges the phone at 2100mA!  Other charges I tried could only get 500mA or 1100mA.* The colors on the phone are supposed to be very accurate, but it looks a little washed out to me for some reason.  Samsung phones have better looking displays in my opinion* There's something funky about the display contrast that makes it hard for me to read text.  It's like the text doesn't stand out enough.  It gives me a headache and makes me dizzy reading on the phone for long periods of time where my old Samsung didn't have that issueOverall, this is a great phone.  It's a flagship that's still small enough and with enough bezel so you can use it in one hand.  I used to be a Samsung fan, but the edge display with no bezel and ever increasing height just make it impossible to use comfortably, so unfortunately they are out for me now.  There are things I miss from my Samsung phones, but over time I'm missing them less and less and liking the unique features of this phone more and more."
5261,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"Facial recognition makes unlocking the phone easy ... almost too easy. The review asks about a fingerprint reader and I gave it 1 star because if this phone has a fingerprint reader, I have not encountered it.Battery life is okay but not as good as advertised. If I listen to audio at bedtime, the phone will die before the morning alarms are set to sound."
5262,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"This is a great phone, for those who are used to androids is easy to handle."
5263,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,I've had so many problems with this phone!! It never has signal ?! It'll just randomly go away?! When I'm home!! And I miss important phone calls because of it. Very frustrated!!! In the beginning I kept getting weird error messages and I contacted the seller.. eventually (after looking it up several times) the error message went away but once in a while it comes back. My maps doesn't work sometimes- the screen will just go black or it won't let me use the app at all! I thought I was upgrading from my very old galaxy (my first smart phone) but I'm considering reactivating that phone and getting rid of this one since my return window has closed. -.- I didn't get a phone from my provider because I didn't want a 5G phone and they didn't offer the pixel 4 anymore since they had the 5 coming out. Now I regret not getting a phone from them -.- I am SO pissed about this phone!
5264,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"I used to wish I had a Pixel 3/3XL instead of my S8+, but I always told myself I would wait for the Pixel 4 to release before blowing a load of cash on a shiny new google device. I used my Pixel 4 for a day before returning it.Pros:1. Fantastic software - The entire interface, assistant, and just general ""all built in"" feel of using the phone is fantastic. However, Google is at it's core a software company, so this would make sense. It's THEIR ecosystem. We can only expect this.2. Solid build quality. Feels like a great phone. Responsive and clear display.3. The camera. I'm gonna miss this. It's pretty great and the magic google works on your photos often works out to make them look instagram/facebook/twitter ready without any tweaking.Cons:1. The battery life. I can not even begin to state what a huge, massive, gaping CON this is. The night I got it I used it a bit, got the battery down, and gave it a full charge in the morning and started the day with a full battery at about 10 AM. By 6:30 PM with minimal use over the course of the day here and there, 30 minutes of bluetooth music streaming in my car, some browsing etc., it got down to 9%.NOW, like I said, it was at 9% at 6:30 PM. What happened next was amazing. I hopped on the phone and opened Chrome, and while just browsing the web watched the battery drop percent by percent from 9% to dead over the course of SEVEN MINUTES. It just kept ticking down right in front of my eyes. Almost 10% battery life gone over seven minutes of web browsing. This totally blew me away.In case you haven't caught on to everyone's point of judgment yet, the pixel 4 actually has less battery capacity than the Pixel 3. This was  huge mistake on Google's part. This device consumes more battery life from a lower total supply. Unforgivable.2. The whole telephoto thing... Google did a regular lens and a telephoto lens. No ultra-wide. They gave some reason why but it was a bad reason based on how ""they feel.""3. The price. This is a flagship and is priced like a flagship, but is falling short of cheaper alternatives like the Oneplus 7T.I'm really bummed that this phone didn't work out for me. I just absolutely can not tolerate my phone dying after ~3.5 hours of use. I can't even imagine if I had tried playing Pokemon Go on it or something battery intensive. What if I were in another country and were relying on this thing? It just really doesn't work. I would have dealt with everything/almost anything else if not for the battery life issue.I hope that google really feels some serious scathing pain over this device pushing them to do a better job next year, because I REALLY wanted a good Pixel, but I won't be shocked if by then Amazon has released a phone that outperforms it in every way attached to their own ecosystem, like they have done with countless other products.This could have all been easily figured out and resolved of course, had the company made the specs of their phone public far earlier. The cries of ""what are they thinking?"" could have possibly allowed them to quickly pivot and resolve these issues, but instead they waited until a week before release to show off their paperweight.This has to some degree turned into rambling. I'm annoyed, I'm disappointed, I expected better.Just don't buy this phone.UPDATE: Due to a newer review stating that I ""must have had my phone on max brightness streaming 4K video"" I'm making this update to clarify my usage even further. I had the phone on adaptive brightness as most people would, and at no point did I stream video. It also looks like fake reviews are starting to pop up. I have no idea what the review about ""google haters and iphone lovers"" is about."
5265,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"Good for being anti-mainstream mainstream, but that's about it. Occasionally confused with iPhone 11 Pro for square camera layout. Otherwise does its job for a being a smartphone, I guess. Every now and then I switch between iOS and Android, so I may be illogical in some stuff below.Bad stuff: Most Android apps still do not support face unlock as biometic access, my OG Pixel's fingerprint was way more ubiquitous. Battery life is confusing, seems to satisfy the needs, but it can you let you down at the worst moments. The phone's gravity center / layout will make your fingers go numb if you hold for too long with both hands. Not many cases out there in market yet, same story with screen protectors. Video recording stability is still poor. No headphones or usb-c to 3.5 mm aux converter is included in the box. Occasionally crashes with apps like instagram? Buzzkill. P.S watch out for privacy stuff, we are talking about Google hardware with Google software here, after all.Middle ground:  Typing on Android keyboard is harder than on iOS keyboard? Idk, your call. Also not a fan of having volume buttons and lock button on the same side. Who needs volume buttons these days anyway?Good stuff: Google Fi eSim compatibility is gamechanger! Also 90 Hz refresh rate is smooooth; back glass of Just Black is even smoother, so watch out placing on slippery surfaces :) Photos are amazing with the AI touch. Two loudspeakers a solid, can fire up some good bass. Love the Pixel wallpaper collections. Charges pretty fast too with its 'rapid' mode."
5266,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"Everyone knows pixels take great pictures. However, if that's not a feature of phones you really don't care too much about, then pass this one up.The pixel 4 is amazing at taking pictures, and google assistant is pretty awesome, however, the battery life is pretty terrible. There are some methods to increase you battery life, which I have employed and noticed a significant difference.Personally, I got the Galaxy s10 and was upset with the photo quality, so I purchased this with the intent to return the s10. I thought the decision would be easy... Well, once I got the Pixel 4 it wasn't.I did end up keeping the Pixel 4, but this is what I gave up in order to keep the superior photo quality:4x the battery life, waterproof, an audio jack, an amazing screen that's edge to edge, expandable memory, 8gb RAM (vs 6 on the pixel 4), and a finger print scanner on the screen (even though it only worked about 50% of the time with the most compatible screen protector on the market)....I gave all that up for better pics.So again, if pictures matter to you, sure, consider this phone. It's solid, and the only thing really holding it back is it's battery life, which you can manage.If they don't matter to you, avoid this phone."
5267,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"I lost my OnePlus 7pro 256gb w 12gb ram at the bottom of Lake Taupo, NZ. A fantastic device it was, with one major issue for me - it was too big, and too heavy for my little hands (literally ended up in constant pain using it - I am a heavy user, self employed live in G-Suite etc etc).Instead of replacing it with another one I decided to 'full Google' with the much smaller Pixel 4.Why Pixel 4?- Perfect size, gorgeous to feel and use- Snappy for a 6gb ram device- Incredible camera (just about to have a baby)Would I buy a Pixel 4 again?No, the 2,700 mAh battery life is shockingly bad, and I really miss the OP7-Pro's 4,000 mAh. Given the same sized, Samsung S20 has a 4,000 mAh, the Pixel 4 really falls short.No, the Pixel has no fingerprint reader, and whilst the face ID is excellent, it doesn't feel good solely relying on it.No, the OP7 has the legendary alert slider, and I miss it terribly.No, in NZ the top tier OP is $1,500. I had to import the Pixel 4 for $1,700. Not worth it.Would I have been happier with a 4XL?Yes, but not heaps happier.Would I have been happier with a S20?Probably.Key message, buy a OnePlus 8 instead - or wait until Google no longer has the arrogance to give us a 3rd less battery life than competitors."
5268,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"I was afraid about Pixel 4's battery life because I've seen many videos from youtubers that the battery life of this phone is as short as it's possible. But I wanted this device as much that I bought it (I wanted to buy OnePlus 8 Pro but when Google dropped the price I said that this is my opportunity to have and test Pixel 4) and I'm happy now. Don't believe them, and just buy this phone if you want to know what is Android and what you can do with that system, Youtubers are testing this phones all day, they are bringing this phone to it's limits and You never will use this phone on that way, believe me. Yes the battery is small BUT this is an Android phone and you can set up your phone how you want and enlarge the battery life. On first day I've charged it twice and I've noticed something, You can turn on the always on display function and drain 10% of battery in just 2.5 hours in idle, or you can turn the always on function off and you will waste just 2% of battery in whole NIGHT. You can turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning in off state (I think this is a useless option) and save much more energy in whole day. Now I'm charging my phone once in two days and I'm calling, using Messenger and Skype for group calls. Don't afraid about battery life, If you know what are you doing and setting up your phone in right way you can have the greatest Android phone in the world. And one more thing, I'M USING MY PHONE WITH 90HZ DISPLAY FORCE ON from developers settings ALWAYS!!! AND IT DOESN'T DRAIN MY BATTERY!!! And yes, taking pictures is draining battery like a devil :) It is very heavy process for this phone but I think it's worth it, photos are just amazing."
5269,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"I was all about this phone when it came out. I bought the iPhone and Pixel that fall and compared photo taking ability. It was very close. The Pixel won out, in part b/c night mode wasn't available on certain camera lenses on the iPhone. Now, a little over a year later, my Pixel is not performing as well as a 1 year phone should. It loses battery fairly quickly, and when it gets low and I'm using GPS, it'll restart. You'd think it'd just stay on until it turns off but no, it restarts now. It makes me think somethings wrong. But lo and behold I'm a few weeks late on filing a claim and the warranty has expired. Sigh, now that the iPhone night mode is on every lens, I really wanted to wait until iPhones use USB C to switch over, but I'm not sure if I will be able to wait that long. Everything else still works OK, and Google FINALLY fixed the bug where copy pasting into the Google search bar caused it to freeze. If it weren't for the battery life and strange restarting, everything would be fine."
5270,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"Ha sido mi telÃ©fono favorito de todos los que he tenido. el sistema operativo es muy intuitivo, fÃ¡cil de usar. No me suele dar problemas, tiene buena memoria, buena resoluciÃ³n. Ambas cÃ¡maras son excelentes, el tamaÃ±o me parece ideal incluso para usar con una sola mano. Tiene buena memoria, me gusta sus funciones. No me agrada que no tenga desbloqueo por huella dactilar y solo por reconocimiento facial lo cual ahora en pandemia y el uso de mascarilla casi que es inservible. TambiÃ©n me ha dado un par de problemas con las recientes actualizaciones en el sentido que no reconoce mi chip sim, sin embargo, no ha sido tan frecuente."
5271,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"This review is of the white 64GB Pixel 4 (non XL) that I received from Amazon on 10/21/19. I have used it for exactly 48hrs so far and here is my early impressions â€“Good stuff â€“1. The build quality is impressive. The matte back is fingerprint resistant and the phone is a beauty!2. The dual (Stereo) speakers are loud and have good clarity.3. Fast charger is included with the phone.Bad stuff â€“ Unfortunately this is a longer list.1. Battery life is miserable. The phone has a 2800mAh battery that lasted me 18hrs with <30 minutes of screen on time. These 18hrs also included an 8hr of sleep time at night, so users will need to charge this at least twice daily, even with minimal usage.2. The 90Hz screen is mostly limited to 60Hz. Youâ€™ll have to enable â€œForce 90Hzâ€ option in â€œDeveloper settingsâ€ if you want to use it in its full glory.3. The face unlock struggles in dark. It also sometimes does not work until you press the power button to activate the phone (I have radar on, so the phone does know my presence). In absence of other biometric options, a crappy face unlock isnâ€™t ideal. One out of 3 times I had to enter my PIN, as the Face Unlock did not work. Most importantly, it works even with eyes closed, so it means someone can unlock your phone while you are sleeping by just pointing it at your face.4. There isn't a USB-C earphone included with the phone.5. There isn't a  USB-C to 3.5mm dongle included with the phone to use with headphones.6. Free unlimited storage on Google Photos is being discontinued with the Pixel 4 and Google wants you to pay for cloud storage.7. Base model is only 64GB, which is tiny for a phone in 2019. 128GB should have been the base model or at least a memory card slot should have been included.8. No dual front facing camera like the Pixel 3.9. No wide angle rear camera â€“ This is a big deal for a 2019 flagship phone. Those who watched the Pixel 4 launch keynote, you know how stupid they sounded when they tried to justify the inclusion of telephote over wide angle.10. No 60fps or higher video recording at 4K. Google cited that the limited internal storage is the reason they have not enabled higher fps at 4K, even though the hardware is capable. I am speechlessâ€¦canâ€™t they just give the users an option?11. Too expensive at $799 for a flagship phone in 2019 with the above flaws.I am going back to my OnePlus phone, which isnâ€™t flawless by any means, but is a very good phone for what it offers and the price it comes at. I can't recommend the Pixel 4 to anyone and don't know if the audience that Google is trying to sell this to, actually exists. If you really want a Pixel, get the 3a...it is a great phone at a very good price!"
5272,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,Beautiful  phone but it's advertised  as  NEW &  UNLOCKED. It WAS NOT!It already had a sim card installed and it was an ATT locked phone. It's being returned. I can not use an ATT Locked phone and it's not what I purchased.BUYER BEWARE
5273,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"So considering switching from the iPhone and testing this out. We are not off to a good start.First off, I was excited by the possibilities of the new Recorder app and built-in transcription. Turns out, this is not installed by default when you get the phone. It's the old Recorder (version 0.5).To get the new Recorder, along with many of the other features that Google touts the Pixel 4 having, you have to go manually update all the apps (Open the Play Store, Select Your Apps, then Select Updates). THEN it installs Recorder 1.0 which has the transcription stuff.However, this is not obvious. Why would Google ship with Recorder 0.5 and other non-release version apps? Frustrating when you're trying to check out all the 'cool' new features touted at the launch. Apple would never do something like this. At least automatically update all the apps when it does the initial 'Check for System Updates'.Secondly, Google's support is useless. They don't know anything and that's assuming you can figure out how to contact them.The camera is great, but nothing special compared to other phones at this point. The HDR trick they use to deal with low light photos leaves something to be desired. I'm not crazy about the look.With the Just Black phone, both front and back are glass which makes it somewhat slippery. You'll probably need a case with it. It's frosted along the sides which is great, but it'd be better if there was more surface area on the back that was frosted.So, a little disappointed with how frustrating it's been out of the box. Now that everything has been updated, we'll see if the user experience improves. Right now, I'll probably return this and stick with the iPhone."
5274,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"I'm only writing this because the negative are pathetic and not even close to realistic in my experience in the first week of owning the phone. The battery is fine. I am coming from a pixel 2 and the battery lasts longer than that phone easily. From full charge in the morning, to browsing the internet, listening to music via bluetooth headphones, checking email, etc etc periodically through the day, I usually end up with about 40-50% battery left easily. To say its done within a couple of hours, that person must have max screen brightness and streaming 4k videos. The screen is incredible, and camera flawless. I am however taking off a star due to not caring for the round edges on the screen and am still having a hard time adjusting to face unlock over fingerprint. Everything else about the phone is nothing short of extremely well executed.One more point, how on earth is face unlock any less secure than a fingerprint scanner? Both can only be opened by the person using the phone. And someone could just as easily put your finger on a scanner as moving it over your face if you're incapacitated. So confused by that one, but that guy got on here to troll as he doesnt even have a verified purchase. Not sure what his agenda is."
5275,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"Bought this for my wife to replace her Samsung Galaxy 8. We long talked about switching from Samsung to Google Pixels due to annoyance of bloatware and way too many features and options (we tried iPhones in the past, we're too deep I to Google's platforms).She is a very simple user so I was excited for her to be the first to try the Pixel. It took all but 30 minutes to realize she was quite disappointed.She complained about the screens 'cheap and faded' look. If you've had Samsung or other premium phones for, this is a noticeable change even for the simplest of users.She seemed disappointed with the pictures. I did not bother investigating much but I feel like the screen not being a bit more contrasty and rich in color (bit more saturation) had lots to do with it. The camera may be great, but the cheap looking screen doesn't help.I waited 2 days to allow her to adjust and I knew it was time to revert to Samsung. I really wanted her and I to love this (I was planning to switch to the Pixel 4 xl in summer) but the simplicity of the phone, subpar feeling and experience was enough to go and grab a Galaxy S20 5G.It was a short-lived experiment. The annoyances from Samsung's Galaxy lines are not a problem after realizing all of the premium features you give up. If you're planning on switching, it may not be worth it; certainly was not for us."
5276,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,Love the Google phones but got this for my husband not long ago and the tocu screen is already finicky in the corners mostly. That's the risks you take when getting used which I'm fine with. We will use it as long as we can.
5277,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"Not a bad phone but the battery life was worse than others so I bought it, waited for the Pixel 6, and haven't regretted my decision."
5278,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"My battery is shot SEVEN MONTHS, months not years, after purchase!  Hard to learn and super sensitive when swiping.  Duplicate areas of notifications, settings, etc so you need to find the correct place to change something rather under one main settings category!  If I had to do it again, I would NOT buy and spend my $700 on a different phone!  Plus I've recently read that google isn't doing well with their phones so who knows if I can even sell it in the future if google stops making phones (they probably should in my opinion b/c the iphone is much better for the price or any phone I guess).  I'm hoping google supplies me with another battery or replaces charging port or whatever is wrong with it:(  If they do I'll update my review so that you know as well."
5279,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"Got open box Amazon Warehouse Pixel 4.  I was debating as if the device will look good or not...  Phone came complete with original box, accessories and phone had no marks, scratches or any dust on it.  Almost felt like the seal was broken but phone wan't used.Now back to the Phone itself.  I do know about some of the shortcomings that YouTube reviewers were mentioning...battery life, no wide angle lens, thicker bezels...I am not a power user by any means(Low to medium) and battery life it fine and lasts day and a half.  I am used to phones that lasted about 2 days but this phone had enough.  Heavy users would want more battery life out of this device for sure!  I do miss finger print sensor at times and of course wide angle lens would be more useful than telephoto one.Phone is fluid as the OS seems to be pretty well optimized for this phone!  Would I buy it for the MSRP, NO, but I paid less than $500 and at this price it is worth it.  I still have my 2 year old Pixel 2 and it performs nicely still and battery is holding a very good charge."

5281,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,Phone works great. Above expectations
5282,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,Battery life suck big time. But I needed a new phone.
5283,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"As the title said, I bought the PIxel 4 to replace my Kyocera, as the battery was going bad.I chose to buy on Amazon, to save myself over $250.I knew to buy an unlocked phone. What I didn't catch was that it wasn't factory unlocked, just carrier unlocked.So, yet it was new in box, and the phone itself is exactly as expected, no problems, it is an AT&T/Sprint phone, and I needed Verizon. My fault, didn't catch it. But looking back, the listing doesn't mention that it could be attached to either carrier.A trip to my very helpful Verizon store fixed it, and everything is fine now.Side note, my son has not had any issues with his over the past 8 months. Battery life is fair if you are using it constantly."
5284,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,I have been completely satisfied with my Pixel phone. It is easy to use and has great features. I would definitely order from this company again if I need another product they sell.
5285,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"I upgraded from a Galaxy S8.  The biggest change I've noticed is the face recognition unlocking.  It works very well and very fast though sunglasses sometimes confuse it.  The phone is fast and smooth.  For setup, I moved my SIM card from my old phone to the Pixel, then connected the Pixel to my old phone via USB and copied everything over.  No need to talk to anyone at Verizon.  Very easy process.  Audio quality is noticeably better.  The camera is excellent.  Battery life is good.  I haven't had any trouble making it through the day.Keep in mind there is no headphone jack.  The wireless charging works well even with a Spigen case on it.The squeeze for Google Assistant feature hasn't been super helpful, but it may just require a change in usage habits.  The same is true for Motion Sense.I haven't dunked it underwater yet, but it should survive for at least 30 minutes at up to 3 ft. deep.  I don't plan on using it underwater, but I hope the water resistance saves the phone if it does take an unexpected swim."
5286,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"I got the Pixel 4 for half the cost of retail price. I'm very glad I did because to be perfectly honest I'm not even sure if this is a $500 phone. Well the face unlock is neat. And the waterproof capabilities are also handy. The Pixel 4 just fails overall, well the software experience is okay The hardware experience is much to be desired.Battery life is absolutely wretched for this device. I'm not sure why Google thought they could get away with putting a smaller battery than what's in a Pixel 3. Absolute fail by Googlelack of a fingerprint reader leaves much to be desired especially if you don't want to use face unlock. The thing that most irritates me about the lack of a fingerprint reader is that so many of my apps started working with it as a alternative sign in method. Needless to say those apps don't work with face unlock and it's just made the phone harder to use.Supposably wireless fast charging has been enabled on this device although not listed in the specifications. That being said I haven't noticed any uptake in charge speed with any of my 10-watt chargers. And since Google changed The label you can't actually tell if it's fast charging or not.And finally yes the lack of a headphone jack is highly annoying and probably will be for the next 5 to 10 years.Overall I would highly recommend you wait for the Pixel 4A or the Pixel 5. if they don't include a fingerprint reader in those devices I would not buy one. The radar features used by face unlock are neat but only work with a few apps and quite honestly cause more headache than convenience especially if it thinks you have swiped in a direction When that's not what was intended. This happens quite a bit with the music app when the phone is on my desk."
5287,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"I purchased this Pixel 4 during the Black Friday sale.  At $599, it is a great value.  I can't say I'd feel the same way at full price of $799.  Don't get me wrong.  It's a great device.  The two main complaints I've read about are a lack of a wide focus camera and battery size.I've never owned a phone with a wide angle lens, but there have been a few times where I wish I had one, but the camera on this phone rocks, and I can't fault it for not having a feature I've never had on past phones.Yes, the battery is smaller than industry standard for modern smart phones.  But what's amazing is that with a small battery, a processor that's one version behind the most current, and a 90 hz screen, the small battery lasts longer than expected and I haven't been disappointed about battery life.  And when it does need to be replenished, it charges FAST.I was hesitant making the purchase because of the critical reviews, but I've been pleasantly surprised that the most talked about issues aren't really issues at all."
5288,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"This is a very good phone.I pre-ordered mine (128 GB White) for essentially the Black Friday cost ($799 for the phone + $100 amazon gift card = $699).You already know that the camera is outstanding.The battery is fine. Maybe if you can kill the battery in 12 hours, you should put your phone down once in a while and enjoy real life. Plus, with wireless charging, is it really so hard to top off the battery during the day? The only time I have every been surprised with battery drain was when I was in a region with poor cell service, but that's not the phone's fault.Face unlock is super fast. I really don't miss fingerprint unlock, assuming Chase gets it together and adds face unlock support. People are crying that face unlock works while you are sleeping and that is ""sooooo insecure""... um do your fingerprints disappear while you sleep or close your eyes? Google will add the eye open check in the near future and it will be more secure than fingerprint, which it currently matches. Calm down."
5289,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"Absolutely loveddd this phone! The price is way cheaper than apple. I had apple all my life and I thought Andriod phones would be something I would never get used to, but I ended up really enjoying it and getting used to it within a day or two. The camera quality is mint. Takes super cool photos of the stars in the middle of the night. And will take clear photos even if the lights are off or in dark settings, without a flash. Only thing I wasnâ€™t too impressed with is the battery life. If youâ€™re like me, on your phone all day, it will definitely need a charge quicker than apple. I had the Apple XR before this which would literally last me a full day plus some. But with the Google Pixel 4, I found myself needed to recharge after like 6 hours probably. But the camera quality made it all worth it! Also endless amount of storage with google photos which I love cuz I take several photos each day!"
5290,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"I purchased a Google Pixel 3 on March 11, 2019.  Within the first 3 months I noticed freezing when the phone would get hot, mostly when plugged in charging.  As time went on, the problem got worse.  at the 7 month mark, I reached out to Google support and they advised that I would need to take my device to a repair center (ubreakIfix) and pay for any necessary repairs out of pocket.  This was devastating, as I had a OnePlus 1 device for 4-5 years prior to upgrading to the Pixel 3.  Of course, the OnePlus 1 was a $299 phone from an unknown company at the time and it was extremely reliable, still to this day working without issue.  I declined to spend more money on the Pixel 3, but with it being such a great device (when it worked), I decided to purchase a Pixel 4, although I felt wronged by Google's unwillingness to help with a device I purchased just 7 months prior.Now I've got my Pixel 4 and I'm thrilled to have a phone that won't just freeze in the worst situations, like the Pixel 3 did.  The 2nd night, or so, that I had the phone, I went to a family event incredibly excited to try out the camera on this new phone and record some memories.  When I arrived, I tried to open my camera and the app crashed.  I tried again... crash.  I uninstalled and reinstalled and the app was still crashing.  Installed security updated, reinstalled camera--still crashing.  So, here I am at a family event trying my hardest to fix the camera on my phone.  Upon 2nd follow up with Google, I asked that my case be referred to a supervisor.  The representative advised that a supervisor would be in touch within 48 hours.  No one has proactively followed up with me.Now I'm here, having spent over $1200 on cell phones in 8 months, and neither phone is fully functional.  I feel wronged with Google's unwillingness to right the 7-month old freezing issue at their cost, while I feel incredibly disappointed that the 2nd device came with issues right out of the box.  So incredibly disenchanted with Google."
5291,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"Huge waste of money. Within 90-days of purchasing this phone, it will not stay on unless it's plugged in and when it is plugged in it overheats to a dangerous temperature. Google service representatives called the phone a 'safety issue' and said I should keep it off and unplugged.When I reached out to the company I purchased in from (Celltraders) they said the following:Hello,Thank you for your purchase. We are very sorry to hear about an issue withyour order.We would like to apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you.Unfortunately, your order is past our return and warranty policy. In thiscase, we are unable to offer a return for a refund or exchange.Thank YouSo, if you want to spend hundreds of dollars on a phone that works for less than 3-months, this is the company for you."
5292,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,Ok let me start with at $549 you can't beat this phone but besides that this phone is honestly great it's very fast the screen is very nice it not to bright but I never liked bright screens to begin with and the cameras are incredible my only issue is batter life is ok I don't think the storage is a big deal considering you can get Google 1 for a $1.99 a month and that gives you 100g of storage what I don't like is how the phone gets ripped on for still have a forhead and a chin by bigger teach YouTube's 80% of ppl I know still have he iPhone 8 and that thing has massive bezels so I feel these ppl doing reviews on YouTube forget not everyone gets the newest phone every few weeks. But besides that rant this phone is great I love it I would buy another if I had the chance
5293,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"I have been a loyal pixel user for years, but the Pixel 4 has been a disappointment. The phone itself it's not great. The major problem is the battery life.. I had to recharge it twice per day to get to the end of the day. The face recognition would be ok, if apps would actually support it. But most banking and secure apps do not support it, so I had to type the password each time, instead of using the fingerprint as I used to do in the past.On top of it, the phone I received had major issues with Bluetooth. Google support has been unhelpful.The problem was that the microphone wasn't working on any BT headset I would use, making it impossible to talk on the phone (or Duo, or Skype or anything else) using a BT headset. I complained with Google and they told me it was a known issue and I had to disable Google Assistant while they were working on a solution.I disabled Google Assistant (even though it's one of the major selling points of this 799$ phone which otherwise would not compare to other top shelf phones), and it worked for a while. After a couple of weeks, it stopped working again, even with Google Assistant disabled.I contacted Google and they told me that since I bought the phone on Amazon, I should ask Amazon for a replacement.I asked Amazon, and they said they would do a refund instead, which was fine for me because at that point I preferred a different phone anyways (I got a OnePlus 7T and it's a much better choice overall).After I finally sent the phone back, Amazon refunded me only 420$ instead of the full 699$ saying I sent the phone after the 30 days period they include in the full refund.So, basically, because I bought the phone on Amazon instead of Google, I ended up losing 280$ because of a nonfunctional phone.I would advice against buying the Pixel 4 altogether, but if you want to buy it, don't buy it on Amazon.I have never been tricked more for a purchase of this type. Lost 240$ with a new phone that stopped working after one month."
5294,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"Great phone, but no fingerprint and face unlock not working. This is a failure. In 2022, you can only choose manual unlock (by PIN, password or combination of dots), tried to reinstall all available android versions (10,11,12,13) with the official web tool, but no way: face unlock not working."
5295,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,I'm giving it 5 stars because to me it was a big upgrade from a Nexus 5x and it does not come bloated with 3rd party applications.GoodFace recognition works like a charm. (I had doubts of what if it doesn't unlock but hadn't had issues made me forget about the missing fingerprint reader.)Applications open super fast compared to my Nexus 5xNo bloatware included.BadNo fingerprint reader but face recognition will make you forget about it.The battery life is not that great but way better than my Nexus 5xI had issues syncing my contacts and activating phone login prompt for 2nd authentication but turning off wifi and using carrier data solved the issue.The phone is a bit heavy compared to Nexus 5x.Other thoughtsDo not buy the phone at full price.Only get this phone is the upgrade is really big and you want to have something that recently came out.
5296,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,PROS: Phone size is perfect on my hands. The light and slim body is a plus - get the Spigen case to compliment the sleek design. Camera - i love all cam features! The price is worth it for selfies as it has a portrait mode that blurs background! taking beautiful scenic views even from afar is a breeze and results are breathtaking! And the Night mode feature!! Im in love with it as you dont need to be a pro to take amazing night and light shots! Speakers are with high quality and bass! Transcribe feature works good. Screen resolution is beautiful. CONS: motion sensor(soli) is not supported in in my country (APAC region). Face unlock is a bit tricky to setup to make it work properly. Overall..you will love owning this android phone more than any other! The price is a bit expensive and it should be $699 only without adding the $100 amazon gift card as the total was at $799.
5297,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"For being an older version of this phone, the picture quality and editing options are remarkable. Although I use my SLR for most pictures, I will send SLR photos to myself on the phone just for the editing options. I ended up buying two because the price was so good."
5298,Google,Pixel 4,64 GB,Android,5.7 Inches,"I had been waiting for this phone ever since details were leaked just before summer. Then the specs were leaked - 6gb OK fair enough. 90hz screen fantastic. 2 camera lenses ok maybe. Snapdragon 855 instead of 855 plus bit disappointing but not enough to stop the purchase.Then they release the pricing - same ballpark as the iphone. OK sure it's a google phone, probably has the same quality as the iphone right?No, wrong. It feels cheap compared to an iphone, it looks cheap compared to an iphone. The ridiculous uncentered screen is dim compared to an iphone. Honestly this phone looks like a 2017 model year phone, not 2019. But then again it's made by HTC which should tell you everything you need to know right there.The spec is a joke, 64gb storage, no free google photo uploads - they are trying to be apple without providing the excellent hardware.Android 10 is great but STILL it has stuttering scrolling even with a 90hz screen. Anyone who says different is kidding themselves, IOS scrolls liquid smooth without resorting to a 90hz refresh rate.The whole radar chip gesture navigation is a total gimmick waste of hardware and resources and screen real estate. No one is going to use it in its current iteration.Android 10 telephony support is inferior to IOS - you can make whatsapp calls from favorites in IOS dialer - not an option in Android 10.Android 10 updates SUCK, even with pixel, the company phone you are only guaranteed 3 years of updates while apple gives you 5.It's SO OVERPRICED I cannot believe google have the cheek to sell this phone at this price bracket. No edge to edge screen, awful battery life, paltry storage.Do yourself a favour and skip the pixel 4."

5304,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I absolutely love this phone. The 132GB really gives you some space to download whatever you'd like. It's lightning fast 5G really makes a difference but i do wish the battery lasted a little longer. Even in power save mode the battery will die within half a day of light use on and off use but still a great phone.
5305,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"This phone is excellent. Fast charging, great battery life, and the storage in this phone is great. Minimum scratches only in the back of the phone. Not one single Crack in the screen and no technical difficulties thus far with my phone. I love it and AT&T works great."
5306,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"This phone works, and if you don't mind the lack of a working fingerprint scanner, its perfect. Mild scratches and scuffs, as to be expected with a refurbished device, but the only issue I seem to be having right now is the nasty ""Fingerprint sensor calibration needed"" error, which is likely a fault of Samsung and anti right-to-repair or something, but I feel that should be more clearly stated in the description of the product.All in all, it operates decently in the time I've used it, but this one minor issue is slightly annoying, considering I tend to use the fingerprint scanner instead of facial recognition (Which does work!)"
5307,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"So far,  so good.  We'll see how long it lasts!  Hopefully a couple of year's. Yea though!"
5308,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I tried to use this phone and I loved it!  For what I do on a daily basis, it was wonderful.  It never took noticable time to ""process"" anything including my games.  All apps were superb.  I was able to watch Disney+ for 5 hours straight, play on Chrome for another 3-4 hours.  I also incorporated a few hours of YouTube and the phone would last for 2 days between charging.  100% to low 10's took anywhere between 36 and 48 hours of that abuse...Then I had to return to work.Use dwindled to a total of 4-5 hours of screen on time or SOT as forums usually write.  Then I charged it 2 times for a total of 9 day's usage!The battery is amazing!The screen clarity also rivals my S21 Ultra.  I never noticed a difference with the displays or graphics.Now the reason it was returned and only 4 of 5 stars:Is it waterproof or resistant?I didn't want the risk of testing that.Is it drop resistant from 2 or 3 feet?I didn't want the risk of testing that.Well, let's get a case that does both!Er, um...  nothing available?  Oh.The size is good, but for watching older shows that aren't wide-screen native, the slight advantage is to my S21 Ultra.Ok, now that we settled all that, let's test 5G...Oh?T-mobile in my area uses only 1 of the available bands on the phone.  Ok, I can switch to Verizon eventually and fix that.Wait, it isn't fully compatible to run on Verizon without a different version?Well, @#&^$&$!^I would have loved to keep it, but it doesn't work with my job that is 80-85% outdoors if I get caught in the rain and I can't exactly get mid-band 5g in my area.On to the S21 Ultra.Valiant effort!"

5310,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,It met all expectations. It is a rebuilt but so far it works. It will have problems however with some older phone SIM cards as they are full size.

5313,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"This is my 6th day using the phone so I'll drop a review and hope it helps give you some insight to what you can expect.Like everyone else I did a ton of research on this phone before I decided to purchase it. I compared it to the non  5G A71, the A51, and the S20FE and this phone takes the cake. The price, the features, and 5G along with customer reviews and YouTube reviews gave me hope to take a chance. If it didn't turn out to be what I wanted I knew I could always send it back.PROS:Great screen - the AMOLED is stunning and its 6.7 inchesCamera - actually exceeded my expectations pictures come out crisp and you have the macro camera for close upsFace recognition - Almost instantly unlocks my phone, faster than my S10ePlastic/Glass back - Actually feels just like a glass back but you can tell its plastic. Did a great job on it though.Processor/Ram - Nothing to fancy but its quick and never lags. Gaming is no issue if you're into that.Headphone jack - yup, you get one on this phone. I find it convenient.Superfast charging - It takes about an hour for a full charge.Battery life - its pretty good. Easily get you through a day and into your nextCONS:Fingerprint sensor - a bit hard for it to read my finger sometimes (Face ID is faster)Speaker - Almost worthless. I rarely use it anyways but you can tell Samsung didn't do much with it.Non-waterproof - this is a bit of a bummer. For my job I'm out in the elements and I don't have that peace of mind like I did with my last phone but I got a case which helps in case it does get wet.I honestly almost cannot tell its not a Samsung flagship model and my friends ALL thought it was an S20+ when I showed it to them. At around $360 after tax with all the goodie features from the flagship phones and with 5G you really are getting a deal here. They say it's a ""midrange phone"" but it truly is a luxury phone.For the case I bought the Otterbox Symmetry clear case.10/10 I recommend buying."
5314,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,It took a while for me to add my thumb print at first but after that I have had no problem with the phone. I'm very happy with the new phone and how much I paid for it.

5316,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I was skeptical about buying a pricey item renewed, recertified, refurbished, given a new chance at life, etc but I did it through Amazon's renewed program so I figured Amazon would back me up if a problem came up. I think there is a 90 day return on it too. I loved the savings in these hard times & it was like new. The battery life is great since I look at booty pics all day long, just kidding, I do that in person. The size is great for my smallish female hands, i didnt want a phone the size of a paperback because i have nicer things to hold. But seriously consider going this route if you want what you want but need to save money. Amazon has got your back."

Â Received on timely matter came with Apple charger but spoke with the seller had to refund for the charger. I purchased my charger but the phone had difficulty charging left in charge all night and woke up with 25% and still doesnâ€™t want to charge so I have to return it for another. Phone looks dissent a little scratchy here and there had some mark by the volume side. Finger response face recognition works great. My only problem was the charging part. I will give 4 start to the seller for the communication but took 1 start for sending me the wrong kind of charge.Update::: I had to return the phone but Iâ€™m not happy because now I have to wait 3 days until I get my refund backğŸ¤¦ğŸ¾â€â™€ï¸. I never ask to get refund on my card never does but they keep telling me it has nothing to do with Amazon. Iâ€™m unhappy"
5318,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Looked pretty thoroughly all over the phone and could not identify a single imperfection when I tried to. No scratches, no chips, nothing. Eventually, much later, I noticed the smallest dust-particle-sized dot on the inner-ring of the camera lip. That is the only sign at all that this phone has ever been handled by another human.The performance is just as quick as I had hoped, and all the functionalities like the camera and fingerprint scanner are operating superbly. So far, I couldn't be happier with this purchase. As far as I'm concerned I just bought a new 5g a71 for hundreds less than normal. It even arrived a day early!I did thoroughly look through reviews of individual sellers, and Chubbiestech had the most consistently good reviews. Virtually everyone in the reviews were satisfied, and the only bad reviews came from shipping issues which Amazon claims responsibility for. So that's who I went through, for reference.**Update: Phone is still great for the 99.99% of things however the phone randomly shut off once. There's a chance it was just a button on my pants that accidently pushed the power button, so I'm not gonna lower my score at this moment.While it could have been my own fault, I rely way too much on my phones for security to risk the chance that it wasn't. So for now, I found arguably an even better deal from the same seller for the s10+.I'll be losing 5G and a better camera. If the impact on my 5G>4G experience is noticeable, I may go back to the a71 at a later time.**Went ahead and began return process, but again this probably should not reflect poorly on the seller or the phone itself. The shut-off could have entirely been some sort of missclick that I didn't see, but I will never know and don't want to find out."
5319,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I'm not going to lie, I wasn't so sure about ordering an renewed phone from Amazon. In the description, it states that this phone is unlocked. After I purchased this phone, I read multiple reviews stating that this phone doesn't work with total wireless ( which is the carrier i use ). I also read multiple reviews stating that the phone isn't unlocked at all and that it only works with certain carrier's. After reading that, I was disappointed and worried that I was going to have to return the phone for a refund. But, then I received the phone in the mail. And it is in-fact unlocked and works with total wireless. The phone has no scratches, or anything! This phone looks brand new, I could never tell it was renewed. The fingerprint is an amazing feature that works so well! The facial recognition isn't as fast as the iPhone x series, but it does work very well. I enjoy this phone very much, it's worth every penny! And the camera, ğŸ˜ğŸ˜ğŸ˜. I could be a photographer with only using this phones camera. ( just kidding ). The camera quality is amazing though!"
5320,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Very good android phone, Samsung - Galaxy A71 A716U 5G Fully Unlocked 128GB Cell phone, without paying the ceiling high prices of the competition, battery runs down within a day; however, will re-charge in approximately 1 hour to 100%. This is a high-quality cellphone; by the way, very quick service from Amazon, you will not be disappointed, this is a rocket- ship if you have 5G service."
5321,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,A good phone for the money with a reasonable speck could do with a slightly larger battery
5322,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I've had this phone for about two months now. Overall I'm happy with it. I read reviews on here before buying it. The thing mentioned most was the fingerprint reader wasn't very good. It's not. Sometimes it takes several attempts to work, then it takes you to your unlock code. Not a huge problem, but frustrating.I read a lot of reviews that complained about the level of sound from the speaker. I personally have no problem with it. It's plenty loud enough for me.I thought the camera would take better pictures than it does. They're good, just not what I expected.Videos look great. I'm very happy with the picture quality and resolution of the phone.Battery life isn't what it's advertised. At least not with the phone I bought. I guess if you don't use the phone a lot, it would last longer.I gave this phone 4 out of 5 stars. I'd actually rate it more like a 3.5. Three stars seems too low, but four seems a little high. Overall, I'm happy with the phone. For a middle of the road phone, it's a good buy."
5323,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"So i wanted to love this phone and i almost did! There was a lot to love but there was also a big problem, MOST CALLS NOONE CAN HEAR ME!! Im always repeating myself, or yelling, or having to call the same number up to 5 times in a row because they'll hang up when they can't hear! Then when they can hear me it's not clear! I'm told that my voice is breaking up or fading!! This is with and without speaker! I feel th8s is an issue only because its a refurbished phone but its supposed to be ""like new"", IT'S NOT!!"
5324,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Worked right away after inserting the H2O sim and transferring contacts/data etc from old android to this new phone.Packing slip said Item: A71-CDMA-BLK-128GB. I was worried that  this support only CDMA.In the phone info saysModel Name : Galaxy A71 5GModel Number: SM-A716U1No scratches on screen.  Rear side looked clean. So far good. Many to test.
5325,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Easy to setup and way to use. Everything you've come to expect from Samsung.
5326,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I bought this specifically to replace my husband's phone, which had a basic camera and he wanted something better to take with him on an upcoming trip. The phone works perfectly fine with all of its features, long battery life, etc., but the camera is superb. He took such beautiful shots with it that strangers on Facebook were remarking on how good they were. I used to tease him about what a lousy photographer he was (they always came out blurry) but now we know it was the camera!"
5327,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I just received my phone today.Positives:1. A good deal price wise. (I bought my last 2 phones as refurbished and had great experiences so I felt good about buying this refurbished too.)2. Everything seems to be running as it should be. Fast and stable. Good so far.3. There are no scratches on the screen and there are no scratches on the back.4. Over all I'm pretty happy.5. The 90 day money back or exchange warranty is a very good thing, especially considering buying a renewed phone.Things to consider:1. There are about 4 minor scratches on my phone. The pictures show close up images of the scratches, but you'll never look at them up close like that. All the scratches are on the edges of the phone.The reason I gave 4 stars is because 2 of the scratches are visible when holding the phone an arms length away, and part of the description was that you shouldn't be able to see any scratches or defects at an arms length. So I was a tiny bit disappointed at first.However, that being said, even if I had bought a new phone, I would have put a case on it. With the phone case on the A71 none of the scratches are visible. So at the end of the day it looks as good as new and I am happy.Having the 90 warranty really gives me peace of mind about taking a chance on this refurbished phone. I say give it a go :)"
5328,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I like it it was great
5329,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Great phone overall. But the fingerprint recognition is sketchy. Only works about 50 to 60% of the time. When it doesn't,  you need to use your PIN anyway. The A21 worked better when the fingerprint  recognition was on the back of the phone instead of the front."
5330,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Our phone carrier is phasing out 3G phones. This forced us to buy a new phone for an elderly man who has memory problems. This A71 phone arrived in near-perfect condition with only one tiny scratch on the bezel of the phone. Hookup and transfer of data from the old Samsung S8 Active phone to this was simple. We went to our carrier to have them switch the sim card and then we did the rest.This A71 phone does everything our Galaxy S20 FE does and more at a price that is affordable. For us it is a great value. I wish I had an A71 instead of my S20 FE.
5331,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I purchased the Samsung â€œrenewedâ€ A71 5G with some hesitancy. Wasnâ€™t sure how the â€œrenewedâ€ aspect of my purchase was going to impact the condition or performance of this device. I was pleasantly surprised! The phone looks and works just like a brand new phone. My family has had many different Samsung â€œAâ€ series phones. When I saw the â€œ5Gâ€ tacked on to this model I could not resist checking it out. I was not ready to invest in a â€œnewâ€ phone of this model. So, I took the risk and bought renewed. So glad I did. The A71 5G performs with excellence. Just as I had come to know the earlier versions. It connected flawlessly and without hesitation to my provider â€œTracfoneâ€. Setup was very smooth. Very intuitive. It took me less than 15 minutes to complete setup and load a full backup from my Samsung A71. The price vs. performance is amazing. Why would anyone purchase a â€œnewâ€ phone when the â€œrenewedâ€ version is identical. Plus it is backed with Amazonâ€™s return policy and free return shipping, if any issues. I would positively recommend the A71 5G to anyone fortunate enough to live/work in a 5G coverage area."
5332,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Great phone for the money. You cannot go wrong here. I've done some research and this model phone has all you need at yesterday's price.

5335,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,Phone was in very good condition with excellent battery life.  Only problem found was that I was not able to use with verizon wireless.

Had to return only for the reason stated. Now to search for one I can use.....
5341,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,UPDATE:Bought this device since it was 5G GSM.  ATT is updating their network in my area.  The phone according to ATT is not compatible with the 5G network.ElectroWireless my seller refunded my money.  Customer Service is still alive.
5342,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"I received my renewed Samsung a71 5G phone last week. I am thrilled with my choice. I want to thank all the verified reviews on Amazon. It helped me to make my decision. I got a great price from ""ChubbiesTech"". And since I had a $50 gift card on my Amazon account for Father's Day, I could apply it to get a better deal.I highly recommend buying this cell phone. In the box, there was a small pamphlet that say ""HI THERE! I'm your new, like-new Amazon Renewed device. Nice to meet you"".Let me conclude by saying ""A RENEWED Samsung a71 5G Phone"" is the way to go!! I equate it with buying an excellent used car with low mileage. Great Price, Great Phone & Great Deal!! :)"
5343,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"guys look, maybe my standards are lower than most people's i dont know, but for me this feels more like a flagship than a ""mid tier"" smartfone.  its lightning fast, powerful, thin and light, sturdy build quality, AMAZING screen AND speaker, and the 5G is like having a home highspeed connection on the go.  i literally have NOTHING bad to say about this.  the only drawback is that it ships in a plane old box with no user manual, so you better download a PDF one or something or just take it to the nice guys at the fone store to set it up for you.  i have owned two samsung galaxies in the past and other offbrand android fones too and this is the best fone i've ever had OR seen.  wouldnt trade it for an iphone.  seriously if you dont buy this right now you're dumb"
5344,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"The phone arrived Friday afternoon. I plugged it in to charge (had 30% battery), unplugged it at 100% charge, and configured it for my NVMO. It sat unplugged on my desk until noon Sunday when I tried to turn it on. The battery was totally discharged. It's charging now, but this does not meet my expectation of a renewed product in ""excellent"" condition."
5345,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,It's working OK

I had an issue about the charger since mine came with an apple charger at first, but they immediately sent me a new one that works on my phone. If you ever run into this issue, the HR responds after a few hours and very willing to help."
5349,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"Phone arrived fast, no scratches no flaws, It came in a generic box with a cable and a power adapterall you need to get you going.If you want a fast charger you better get one, just make sure it is compatible with your phone (25W Max).Phone is truly unlocked just put in your SIM card and a Micro sd memory card (takes up to a1TB card) and you're good to go.Order a case because the back is a fingerprint magnet, and at least for me it's kind of slippery, but the case took care of that."
5350,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,My Phone is a 'Renewed' phone in like new condition. Battery life is 'great' when compared with my old Galaxy S5. Usually last for 2 days with my usage which is probably a little less than the norm. I cannot say the charger is a 'Fast Charge' unit. I am satisfied with my purchase.
5351,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,I received the phone today . I wa a bit nervous with purchasing a refurbished phone . I saw 9 other choices at a lower price like $330 or so the one i bought was priced at $350 plus . I was shocked as heck to see the one I purchased was perfect no scratches dints or dings . I ordered a case and glass protector for today . I'm excited at condition and happy with the purchase hopefully it operates as good as it looks . I will give another review about the performance at later date .
5352,SAMSUNG,A71-A716U,128 GB,Android,6.7 Inches,"i am very pleased that it arrived 1 day ahead of schedule.contrary to rumor, google does not restore or transfer all the contents and layout from the old phone, so i only started using it this morning as it took most of the day yesterday to set it up.  there was no pin tool in the box to open the sim tray, so that was a problem that i had to go the a phone store to have the sim card installed.i am more accustomed and familiar with android 9, and of course 10 is just enough different to make the change difficult.still, all looks promising so far!!!!!"
5353,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Lo tengo en mis manos desde el 11-10-2022; y hoy 11-11-2022 hago mi reseÃ±a para compartir mi experiencia.Aunque es la primera vez que compro un telÃ©fono con 8GB de RAM, puedo decir que estoy muy complacido con mi compra, ya que mi anterior telÃ©fono tenÃ­a 3GB.En cuanto al espacio de 128GB, me siento bastante bien y conforme, ya que antes tenÃ­a que estar eliminando Apps, Fotos y Videos para tener mÃ¡s espacio disponible.Algo que deseaba tener de un telÃ©fono es el puerto Tipo C, ya que es mucho mÃ¡s cÃ³modo y eficiente; y por suerte, ya lo van a estandarizar, por lo que todos los telÃ©fonos del mundo que salgan a partir de ahÃ­ lo tendrÃ¡n.El tamaÃ±o de la pantalla es excelente, ya que, hace mucho que querÃ­a tener un telÃ©fono con una pantalla de mÃ¡s de 6 pulgadas, ya que asÃ­ todo se ve mucho mejor y ayuda a no forzar tanto la vista.Me encanta la idea de que mantenga las actualizaciones al dÃ­a, asÃ­ podrÃ© sentirme un poco mÃ¡s seguro, ademÃ¡s de la optimizaciÃ³n del equipo, que siempre viene incluida.La cÃ¡mara de 48 MegapÃ­xeles y el excelente Zoom me tienen complacido; solo que a veces pone las fotos como con ambientes que hacen que no tengan la suficiente nitidez y calidad, pero he notado que lo hace cuando el clima exterior no estÃ¡ normal y soleado. La cÃ¡mara frontal tambiÃ©n estÃ¡ muy bien.Ahora puedo jugar mis juegos favoritos con total libertad y movilidad; aunque, hay algunos que siempre exigen mÃ¡s, por lo que, en Ã©se caso, solo me adapto.Se siente bastante bien al agarrarlo, ya que es liviano, suave y fino; y aunque el protector es fino y delicado, le puse un PopSocket para poder agarrarlo con mayor comodidad, ya que se me hace difÃ­cil usar un telÃ©fono sin Ã©se accesorio.Me gusta la idea de que tenga el cristal Gorilla Glass 4; que aunque tengo otros protectores para el telÃ©fono y la pantalla en mi carro de Amazon, me siento un poco confiado de que si se me cae, no se me daÃ±arÃ¡ la pantalla muy fÃ¡cil; ademÃ¡s, me siento tranquilo al poder poner llaves en el bolsillo junto a Ã©l, ya que antes tenÃ­a que tener cuidado y usar un bolsillo exclusivo para el telÃ©fono, para evitar rayones en la pantalla.TambiÃ©n me he adaptado a la nueva forma de usar el telÃ©fono sin botones en la parte de abajo; ya que al tener la opciÃ³n de ""ir atrÃ¡s"" con solo deslizar hacia la izquierda o la derecha en los bordes, es mucho mÃ¡s cÃ³modo, fÃ¡cil y eficiente.Otra opciÃ³n que me encanta muchÃ­simo es la de la ""llave inteligente"", que es el botÃ³n del lado izquierdo, ya que ahÃ­ configurÃ© las capturas de pantalla con un solo toque, ya que hago capturas a cada rato sobre los juegos que voy jugando, entre otras cosas; y la linterna la puse con 2 clics porque al ponerla con 1 se puede activar al meterse el telÃ©fono en el bolsillo o al ser tocado sin interÃ©s de encenderla.Tiene muy buen sonido y se siente bien al escuchar lo que voy viendo y sin problemas de calidad.El sensor de huellas digitales estÃ¡ alucinante, ya que tiene una sensibilidad muy buena.Sin embargo, no uso protecciÃ³n con huella digital por Seguridad, ya que, un PolicÃ­a mal intencionado o un delincuente, pueden obligarte por la fuerza a poner tu dedo o dedos para abrir tu telÃ©fono y robarte dinero o informaciÃ³n que no tienes interÃ©s en compartir; por eso solo uso un patrÃ³n, ya que, aunque alguien intente ver de lejos, es mÃ¡s difÃ­cil seguir la ruta de tus dedos; pero no serÃ­a igual si pones un PIN.Hasta ahora lo Ãºnico que no me ha funcionado de las opciones internas es la del NFC, ya que solo aparece la opciÃ³n de configuraciÃ³n avanzada (en inglÃ©s), pero al tocarla no lleva a ningÃºn sitio; y cuando abro alguna App que permite pagos sin contacto, al buscar la tecnologÃ­a en el telÃ©fono y no encontrarla, se sale.En fin, estoy satisfecho con el telÃ©fono; y con relaciÃ³n al tema de los pagos NFC, deberÃ­an resolver eso con tiempo, ya que hoy en dÃ­a eso es muy necesario e importante y deberÃ­a de estar funcionando con normalidad; aunque, espero que corrijan el error en alguna actualizaciÃ³n.Sin dudas mi compra de otro telÃ©fono mÃ¡s adelante serÃ¡ de la Marca Umidigi, ya que ofrecen dispositivos de alta calidad con garantÃ­a, a muy bajo costo.Gracias por tu tiempo.Gracia y Paz."
5354,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The Umidigi F3 is the perfect mid-range mobile phone for the user who wants a balance of performance and price. This phone has a premium features, more-than-acceptable camera, excellent battery life, and speedy processor.Premium Features: The F3 includes features that you would find in pricier phones.  You can unlock the phone via the front camera or the side button fingerprint reader.  I happen to prefer using the side button over the screen reader on most other phones because of convenience.  The F3 also includes an FM radio receiver built in.  How cool is that!?!  Another capability that you no longer find in most phones is a headset jack.  You have the option to use both wired and wireless headsets.  Although the screen is only 1650 x 720, everything is bright and clear.  Playing non-graphics intensive games has been great with no motion issues.Camera: The F3 triple rear cameras and single front camera are more than acceptable for the regular user.  Selfies turn out sharp and clear and photos with the rear photos have clarity that match more expensive phones like the Samsung S21 (I couldn't believe it either...and my significant other is quite ticked off on how much she spent on her S21...LOL).Battery: The F3 has a 5150 mAh battery, which surpasses almost every other phone out there.  I can easily wait 2 days before having to recharge the phone.  Only negative is that there is no wireless charging.Processor:  This is the biggest surprise for me with the F3.  The MediaTek Helio P70 was fast with no noticeable lagging when navigating apps, playing games, and editing documents.  Granted, the chip cannot handle graphics hogging games, but then, most phones can't either.In general, I would recommend the Umidigi F3 to anyone who wants a phone that provides higher value than the price would indicate.  This would also make a great second phone or one for your younger kids."
5355,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The specs seem good on paper, but it struggles when connected to my car with Google Auto. It's pretty good otherwise, most applications run with no perf issues.The location of the fingerprint reader (part of the on/off button) is uncomfortable - most times I hold it, one of my fingers is there, and the reader tries to decipher it even though I didn't want that.All in all, a mediocre phone that's somewhat disappointing compared to the older S3Pro. The only reason I replaced the S3 Pro is that Umidigi doesn't provide any updates for it, so it's stuck with Android 9."
5356,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Still learning about what all this phone can do but all in all I'm very happy with this purchase. Especially after agonizing for 2 weeks as to what phone to get. I'm glad I chose this
5357,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,First off had a heck of a time getting it to hook up to my wifi.  Kept telling me was connected but no internet. I still tried to open Chrome told me my date and time were wrong so couldn't do a hand off. Here the date was Nov 2004 and was set to somewhere in Mexico. Once corrected that seemed to fix it that!  my old Umidigi was 3 yrs old and the battery was dying. So far so good with getting on US Mobile was a breeze. Will try to update.
5358,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,It's okay.
5359,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The umidigi F3, another umidigi phone entering my household. This has been number 5? So I may be biased, but there's a reason I've identified so well with this brand. They produce quality inexpensive phones. The hardware you get for the price you spend is easily twice as much as other competitors.I know and trust umidigi, they update their software, they support their customers, and they make awesome tech. Trusting a company, especially one that most people haven't heard of, is such an awesome thing.I get a phone with a wonderful camera, good battery life, that's stylish, comes with a case and screen protector, all for less than what most garbage phones in the states ask for.Ask yourself do you actually want to keep buying phones that are overpriced or don't work? No of course not. Umidigis f3 phone works in there U.S they make actually global, global phones.All this on basically stock android too, no horrible software bloat like the major companies I've bought from add into their phones.Give umidigi a try, My house uses them, my uncle uses them, and my friends use them."

5361,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"This is a performance phone for $200. UMIDIGI is a go to phone if you want a cheap phone with high end specs. Well worth the price.. why?Pros:8GB Ram and 128 GB internal storage. Plenty for smooth operation and storageGreat Pictures from Sony Cameras.. my attached pics were taken with the phone. Crisp clear pictures!The short cut button is customizable and really helpful for frequent tasks and quick launch of appsThe humongous battery and fast charging together, they give you a peace of mind for days. Turn off the ""screen on when you pickup"" function from settings if you want to extend batter lifeGlobal 4G network compatibility without loss of speed and reliabilityAudio is loud and clearNo bloatware.. this is very important for meCons:Android 11 - will it ever get to 12?Not a 5G phoneThe finger print scanner is the power button.. it's really sensitive and I accidentally turned the phone off multiple times, while trying to setup fingerprint. I would've also preferred an in screen finger print scannerI'll continue to update this as I use the phone.. overall, I recommend this phone if you are looking for a cheap high performance phone."
5362,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"This phone is a perfect mid-ranger. I believe it's perfect for kids to adults that just want a reliable device that runs without lag. I have been using Umidigi devices for years now. They all still work without issues for all this time. I still use an Umidigi S3 Pro as my Pokefone. This is still a brand that provides a case, a screen protector, and a charger ! The battery lasts all day, the screen is nice and big, and the back looks great. It has a shortcut button that let's you choose whatever app you want to open with a single click. And then you can choose a different app for a double click. I usually pick the flashlight for that. And then a press and hold for a 3rd app. I love that if you choose to navigate with gestures, there is not hint bar like on Pixel devices, yo get a nice full screen. This phone has zero bloat. This phone has 8gb of ram so you won't have any slowdowns. And if you are Android tinkerer like myself, it is very easy to root this device. At this price point this is a no brainer."

Umidigi F3 is a great phone for everyday use, with 8 GB memory and 128 Gigs of internal storage, there's no worry of running out of storage because of pics or apps.The battery capacity for Umidigi phones have been at the 5050mAh which gives more than a day of good usage easily too, I have another Umidigi Phone (s3 Pro) for 2+ yrs now which still gives a day plus of usage.Having used this phone for a couple of days now, and haven't experienced any lags or missed touch response.The UX has been kept close to stock and not a ton of default Apps come installed which is great!Easily able to connect to 4G LTE networks ( TMobile and AT&T). Camera quality is good for this price range. The customizable button comes in handy for frequent operations.It also comes with a charger/USB3 charging cable, a screen protector applied and a protector case!!The only thing that I think could have been better was if it came with Android 12, it runs Android 11, I hope that it gets Android 12 upgrade soon.Overall a great value!"
5364,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"If you are looking for ""bang for the buck,"" this is it.  First off, I have to say that I am a bit prejudiced. I've owned a Umidigi F1 Play for several years and it has been faultless.  When I saw this F3 at $161.49 I thought I would try it.  After receiving it I found its large screen, 6.7"", to be bright and exactly the size I wanted.  After starting it up the processor was blazing fast.  Another big plus is the reception.  I have found dead spots with my other phones in my area.  This one pulled in a signal where others could not.  I was disappointed in one area, transferring apps and data from my old phone.  I tried Bluetooth and NFC and I could not connect to my old Umidigi F1 Play.  It may have been me or there was a compatibility issue between the two phones.  What you get with this phone is a good camera, great performance, outstanding connectivity, and an unbeatable price."
5365,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The silver color looks so pretty. Features of camera are powerful and really useful, I like the extrawide angle mode. The screen is big and bright and crisp. Big battery, 8g of memory, 128g of storage, mainstream configuration, smooth operation, clear and bright sound, and importantly no annoying app built in ---- I don't like being forced to cram in a lot of junk. Also commendable is the gift of a beautiful transparent phone case.However, the adapter is always so big due to fast charging.  My power strip is overcrowded  :("
5366,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Iâ€™ve owned several union phones. The phones do not feel cheap or miss essential features. The new f3 actually is a great phone. Is better than the Samsung a series. The photos are quite good, the phone is zippy, the screen is bright and crisp. I am actually impressed. It paired with my watch and no problems with Wi-Fi or lagging in videos. Those phone is actually worth more then theyâ€™re charging. Iâ€™ve given cheaper phones to the kids and they actually prefer this phone and want me to buy one for their birthday."
5367,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Trying to reset access point name information hopefully it will be compatible with TracFone
5368,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Good display for being 720p, easy to hold with 20:6:9 aspect ratio. Beware description says stereo speakers but bottom firing speaker only."
5369,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I like the phone a lottttt, but the matte silver looks a lot darker than the one advertised in the pictures. I'll be returning it for a black one. My Qlink wireless sim card works good in this phone. Great size and price"
5370,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I must admit it is a very nice looking device.  However I'm not sure if it's a 4g or LTE phone. I tried to get it activated on 3 different service providers and neither could get the phone activated. But looked good,  camera seemed nice,  screen was clear but while using super fast xfinity internet it seemed a little slower than I expected."
5371,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Wow wow wow!!! This is a beautiful phone for a fraction of what phones usually cost. Brand new and packaged beautifully. It works like a charm and I am very proud to call this my phone. The more expensive brands are so overrated and they charge too much. This phone is worth it folks!
5372,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,The phone has a great finish and the battery life is insaneits easy to set up just put my sim in and its up and runningthe headphone jack is a plus
5373,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Phone was locked for Boost, but they have made every reasonable attempt to take care of it."
5374,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Battery life is Great! And the picture quality is Awesome, been watching more of my shows on the go. Umidigi has come up Big!"
5375,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Make sure you read everything
5376,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Unboxed, set up wifi, transfer all stuff from my old phone, man I love this phone, up until I put my Sim in. The Mrs got a text from cell carrier that my number was deleted from the account, phone locked up no internet no text, no calls nothing. Att/cricket text said to immediately put my Sim in my old phone or reactivation fees will be incurred. Switch back Sim to old phone call them up they say its a 3g phone, I said no I made sure it was 4g, check imei numbers it's 3g.best of luck this is my 6th umidigi but the last 2 have been no goes because of being 3g but labeled 4g"
5377,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,The battery lasts all-day! Even with me using the phone the entire day it had 17% charge when I went to bad. I bluetooth music to my bedroom stereo and play it all night. Music was still playing when I woke. The phone works lightning âš¡ fast. The facial recognition is nice. Fingerprint is iffy. I have problems with fingerprint readers on every phone I have owned. The F1 seems to be getting better with the fingerprint reader as I use it more. Great phone for an excellent price.
5378,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"It says unlocked to all carriers but,it's wrong and false advertisement because,I took it to cricket and tried to get this phone on with a new sim card .and they said it's not compatible with cricket service so I'm having to send this phone back before I can even get my 200 back so I'm not very happy,and the seller needs put on here who it is and who it is not compatible with because,it's bull crap when you got unlock to all carriers when's it's not so if you have cricket do not buy this phone bc it won't work...."
5379,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"El equipo en general llegÃ³ en buenas condiciones, la pantalla tiene un pixel muerto pero en general el celular funciona bien"
5380,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Really great for the price, I've heard some iffy reviews of camera, but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. The tones are a tad warm, and you have to take the time to focus correctly in bokeh(portrait) mode, but all in all very satisfied. Quick and powerful. I'd buy it again."
5381,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Muy buen celular justo en cuanto a exigencias de organizaciÃ³n y procesacion de programas muy rÃ¡pido con muy buena baterÃ­a y a un excelente precio no le pide nada a los de gama alta
5382,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I love love love this UMIDIGI Smartphone. This is the perfect size. Response is very fast. The look is streamlined. The color, which is a dreamy color RED is not too bright , just right.  Kind of satin looking. The weight is perfect. I am so happy!!! Just get this exceptionally beautiful high end phone."
5383,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Good phone.. Value for money. Bought it for discount.
5384,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,This is not good at all.
5385,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Hasta aora todo funciona perfectamente
5386,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,The camera on this phone is crap. For 48 and 16 megapixal camera. It's cheaply made. And then to compare it with Samsung camera that's just lie and deceptive. Now the speaker not working. It's I rip off. Not worth the cost.  I wanted a phone because my phone stopped working but this is garbage
5387,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Update July 2020.After having the phone for a few weeks, a few dead pixels show up, in the middle of the screen, only noticeable in black backgrounds. They sent a new one with no problem, and I am in the process to returning the old one. The new one is working great so far, we had to go back to metropcs to activate the sim card in the new one, this time they charge us 25 dlls, we like this phone a lot, the battery is durable, the camera is great. I am planning to order another one for my self, this one is for my boyfriend, he works at construction so that is why the screen protector is already damage in the old phone, for normal use it will be fine for a while. I didn't find any good hard case protector in amazon, but I tried at the store the case for Moto G Stylus and it did fit the phone, the only problem are the buttons in the case, they don't match, but I don't mind, I am planning to make a hole or something, because I really need a good sturdy case before my boyfriend crack the phone.June-2020Arrive on time, despite the seller didn't gave any tracking information. The phone works great and the battery life is good, has 1 slot for 1 SIM only, and the 2nd slot is for a SIM or a SD card. Is working fine with metro-pcs, despite we had to go to different customer service places, because in the 1st one they just say that phone won't work with metropcs, they only switch the SIM from the old phone to the new one, of course that didn't work! american cell phones companies married the SIM with the imei, so the company has to do the process first. in the second place, the lady was really helpful and start the process immediately, took like 5 minutes and cost under 17 dlls. I also tried a mexican SIM from movistar and works really good, I didn't even had to add the configuration for APN, to have 4G, automatically did it, not like other unlock phones I had before. The camera is decent, and the apps run smoothly, comes with one screen protector installed and a simple black case, flexible."
5388,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Pones are nice however they donâ€™t work with tracfone.
5389,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Had the Play F1 for 17 months and very happy with the phone for the price. Easily the best battery life of any phone I have owned. Can get over 10 hours screen on time staying between 10 and 90 percent as do not charge to 100 or deplete under 10 to protect the battery. Call quality is good, speaker is loud enough, screen size and colors are great. Camera is just okay, when you really blow up images, the detail is not there. Although I'm comparing to a Pixel 2, so can't expect it. Performance is fine and never noticed any slow functions. I do not game, so no review on gaming.Phone has many bands and have used it in USA and all over Asia with multiple sims and works very well.  Dual sim feature is nice to have."
5390,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Great camera
5391,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I got this and it don't work.  It won't turn on.  They are sending me another one and ifnit don't work I am done with it.
5392,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Great great
5393,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Nothing bad to say except I wish the case that came with it was a hard case. The case is so flimsy. It won't stop it from being damaged if I drop it.
5394,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I love this phone comparing it to the a13 or a11 this phone is way better specs memory and all the specs are great not quite 90hz but the screen is cinimatic viewing beautiful you will enjoy paying games on this device and watching movies and the colors are beautiful love the camera hdr mode and just the detail all the specs you need. Giving this a 5 stars also seller is fast shipping got mine the next day. I really love this device. Good price too
5395,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I am happy with this phone, it is cheap but very nice and fast, the battery lasts a long time"
5396,UMIDIGI,F3,128 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I usually wait a whole month after purchasing a phone to review but I've had this phone for only 4 days and I hate it!! When i saw all of these 5 star reviews i was very skeptical because this brand never gets more than 3 stars and now i see why! First, the sound is horrible, so low that whenever I watched a video or movie i had to bring the phone close to my face to be able to hear correctly! I always used closed caption because the sound is unbelievably low!! While watching videos the images often would become very pixilated. The front camera is terrible too! Also whenever a call comes in while im doing something on my phone, the caller ID isn't displayed and I'm unable to answer the call! There are a few other annoying things but those were the most bothersome for me and because of that I'm not keeping this phone and I'll never purchase this brand again!!"

5403,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"My wife, 3 children  and I all use iPhones and have various different models.  My parents use Android phones because they preferred Samsung phone over Apple iPhone.  They are now so used to using the Android phone, they don't want to switch over to iPhone but my dad recently dropped his Samsung phone on a hiking trip and his phone cracked opened and needed to get a new one so I got this as his replacement Android phone until his current AT&T contract ends for new promotional upgrade.  I told him to give it back to me once he gets a new phone later because I can use this as a backup phone incase one of my kids lose or break their phones but he actually loves this phone so much that he might just keep it permanently.  We all have AT&T family plan and this TCL 30 SE worked fine with AT&T service and should work with any other GSM carriers.I helped my dad replace the nano-sim card from old broken phone to this TCL 30 SE then set up his Android phone. I was so impressed with this phone, I played around with it to compared with my iPhone and how they are different from each other.WHAT I LIKE:[+] 6.5"" HD screen is really clear and crisp. The colors look beautiful on the screen.[+] The package comes with the screen protector AND a phone case!  I always had to buy screen protector and phone case separately for all our family's iPhones...[+] There are 3 cameras on the back and the main camera is 50MP while other 2 cameras are used for macro and field depth function.  Yes, 50 megapixels wow...[+] I love the biometric finger print reader on the back of the phone, perfectly placed for the index finger.  You can just hold the phone and touch the reader with your index finger to unlock and turn on the phone screen.  Very simple and hassle free.[+] It also has phone unlock feature with face recognition using front camera as well as PIN code.  Front camera is 9MP and is also very impressive in picture quality.[+] Comes loaded with the latest Android version, which is version 12.[+] I love that internal memory space can be increased with micro-SD card up to 512GB!  This is something you would never, ever see with Apple's iPhones... so jealous[+] The phone feel solid and sturdy when holding, while it's not too big like Apple iPhone Pro Max[+] Great battery life so you don't have to charge every day.[+] Fast and responsive screen and touch.[+] Price!  It's a fraction of the cost of iPhone or Samsung phones.WHAT I DON'T LIKE:[-] I'm so used to using iPhone so I'm very confused when using Android OS so this is not specific to this phone as Android OS is made by Google.  Same reason why my dad can't switch from Android to Apple since he's now so used to using Android OS.[-] It does not support 5G network but this is not a big deal for my dad who mostly uses his phone for calls and always uses WiFi at home.BOTTOM LINE:Easily 5 out of 5 stars.  I am very impressed with the camera and love taking pictures and video with this phone as I use my iPhone to take pictures of my kids all the time.  I still can't believe it has 50MP camera and pictures come out crisp and beautifully.  You rally can't go wrong with this Android phone for the price.  Highly recommend it to any Android phone users."

Â Got this budget phone to use as my secondary phone and also to put an international mobile sim in it. Didn't want to spend a fortune as my primary phone is one of the latest iPhones and hence decided to go for this after a friend's suggestion. Overall I am very satisfied with the phone for the features it offers at this price. Comes as a complete package including a case and a screen protector too. I would recommend this phone for this price and if you are fine with the cons mentioned below.Here is my take after owning this phone for a week:Pros:- This phone is compatible with all US carriers mentioned in the description. I tried it with a T-Mobile connection and it works great- It has a good microphone and the sound is clear overall during calls- Screen resolution is good (6.52"" HD+ display with 720x1600 resolution & 20:9 aspect ratio) and usable for most of the needs- Screen is bright and even usable outdoors in sunlight- It has a loudspeaker overall and does the job for most of the needs. Audio works great- Comes with 64GB ROM, however, around 30% of the storage is being used by the operating system itself. But, the SDcard slot lets you expand the storage by 512GB further- It is an android phone and hence supports all the apps that you can imagine (email, MP3, GPRS, FM radio, touch screen, GPS navigation, video player, Internet browser, Google map, etc.). This phone does everything that any smartphone should do. Full-fledged features at this price point- Touch screen is surprisingly good and responsive too. Attached is a video with my attempt to use it- Phone is handy enough to operate. I was skeptical initially thinking about the size of the phone- Comes with the latest android version loaded in it. Hopefully will have the updates also available when the new one comes- Has both fingerprint and face unlock options. Fingerprint unlock is fast enough- The camera quality is good enough for basic needs & especially at this price- Has 5000 mAh battery and should give 2 days of use after each full charge- There are literally no additional apps pre-installed on the phone and come clean from bloatware out of the box. Very user-friendly software- Build quality is nice overall & the phone looks elegant overall- Phone is lightweight overall and handy to use- It is very reasonably priced for the features it offers- Power adapter is included in the package to charge this phone, however, it is not a blazing fast charger- They do bundle a clear case and a screen protector in the package- Comes with 1 year of manufacturer warrantyCons:- It only has the 4 GB RAM and of which 1.9GB is already occupied by the Android system, hence does not leave so much room for heavy applications or games. I wish it had 6 or 8 GB of RAM- Slow charging speed with 15W as per current market advancements- Does not support 5Ghz Wi-Fi network and hence you will be limited with WiFi speed at 2.4Ghz- This is not a 5G phone and hence not future proof- Camera is overall good but picture quality can't be compared to iPhone ones- Not compatible with any CDMA networks. The buyer should consider this before purchasing it- Only 1 year of guaranteed software updates and that could be a big concern for a few picky customers- No IP ratings for water or dust proofing"
5405,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"I've had cell phones for years and I never experienced the problems that I've had just setting up this phone. Continuously locks up into a black TCL logo screen, even in the middle of the setup. I should have listened to the reviews. Returning to Amazon asap. To bad thought I like the styling and features. Update :I was prepare to return this TCL 30se phone back to Amazon for a refund. I have the return bar code on my phone and just needed to drop it off at kohlâ€™s department store. I decided to try setting up the phone one last time. This time I didn't install the sim card or the SSD memory card.  I did a clean install without using the cable to transfer my files from my old phone which is a LG premier pro with Android version 10 to the new phone. I manually programmed every step in the setup process and the phone started working. I installed the sim and SSD card everything connected then I started to delete the unnecessary apps and updated the remaining ones. I loaded the remaining apps I needed from Google play store. I've been using the phone the past several days and I still have 20 days of my 30 days warranty left to return the phone. I don't think the phone is slow at all. But I never had a expensive phone before."
5406,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,La baterÃ­a para un uso normal 24 horas y la vida de la baterÃ­a tengo un Sansug que tiene 7 aÃ±os y no le he cambiado la baterÃ­a y le doy rosca en el trabajo que tengo que cargarlo todas las noches
5407,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,the only reason i will not give this phone 5 stars is for 139$ its super slow ! what the heck  the Quality and and pictures are AMAZING but the time it takes to do things is just nope  THATS CHINA FOR YA  i guess
5408,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"I have only had Android phones so I can't speak to any iPhone comparisons, but for me this has been a great phone so far. I have had a series of LG's for the last few years and they have all been pretty decent, but my latest LG (K51) was pretty unimpressive from day 1. Slow, laggy, unresponsive and prone to freezing, it mostly disappointed me. Decided to try this TCL based on other reviews and the fact that it works on T-Mobile and shares the same SIM card size as my K51. also got it on sale on Amazon for only 118$ so why not give it a try right? After a week it has been great, good battery life and very smooth and responsive UI setup. Haven't taken a ton of pictures yet but the few I have taken seem decent enough. Face recognition works great as does Smart lock with trusted Bluetooth devices. Swapping  SIMs worked no problem for me on T-Mobile, did not need to visit the phone store at all just switch and go. Based on a week of use I would recommend this very highly for the budget cell phone shopper!"
5409,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"This was meant to be an upgrade to the TCL that I already had but it wasn't really, except for space.  I wanted a bigger screen for better text size reading and it wasn't that.  Google asks you on and on and on to give permission for their take over and don't explain what you are getting into.  SOME Google is okay, but this is a take over.  Has some nice features if you can wade through all the permissions and managing you!  I want a phone that feels like mine and not a company's!  Phones are getting too complicated to be useful!  I want to be in charge of my own life, not turning it over to a take over company who wants to milk you for all they can, and DO because you don't realize what you are getting into.  I was greatly disappointed because I liked my earlier TCL.  And the magnifier on there was a hassle to use, because it was narrow and time consuming to use.  Older people spend money too!  And some are vision impaired and still need a phone.  We're not stupid at all, just need a little help for seeing!"
5410,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"It's been awhile since I last had a TCL smartphone....a few years & it died suddenly. I have now had this TCL 30 SE smartphone for a couple of months now & so far, not too bad.Pros:  Good battery life, decent-sized 6.52"" LCD screen, seems to run fast enough & not very laggy for the most part, rear fingerprint lock/unlock feature, enough internal storage space [128gb] for apps, pictures, videos, music & so on, decent quality video playback on its screen, decent video recorder & 4GB of RAM for light gaming. Cons:  Not so good still photo qualities indoors and only fair photo qualities outdoors. Also, hard to find protective cases for this phone. Overall, it's a pretty good semi-basic smartphone that is nicely sized that should suffice for basic use such as phone calls, texting and looking thru apps. It's not a gaming phone for sure, but mild games will work most likely on this phone. I ordered another one but the 64 GB storage version that otherwise is identical to this version for my other phone I have. 5 stars I rate this phone"
5411,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"Setting up this phone was easy, great battery life, good picture taking, and visually appealing. Speakers are not that good, and WiFi isn't 5Gh (which is fine by me). Overall this is a great phone for such little cost and I love it (Android 12 on this thing is awesome). When I'm listening to music or enjoying videos, earphone's with Bluetooth work great, or speakers, because it's sort of a must have with me when I'm using it."
5412,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"Tried a new name brand to me. I usually only.own Samsung. But, this TCL is almost as good as my old Galaxy. Even let's Samsung Smart Switch move all info into new TCL. Amazing!"
5413,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,It took several days to research for a new phone because it had to be unlocked. The description said it was. However when I received it it said locked by T-Mobile. I have qlink wireless and they do use T-Mobile so I'm waiting for the first of the month for them to upload my unlimited everything to see if it will work via qlink. More to be revealed.
5414,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"This is a nice basic phone. A few details worth noting are that you cannot transfer apps over to the SD card. Also, it seems to take quite a long time to restart the phone. A nice surprise is that the phone comes with a free clear case and screen protector. Pretty cool! Overall, the phone meets the needs for browsing and video watching."
5415,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"Honestly Iâ€™m blown away by this phone. It came in two days, and I was worried it was gonna have a slow responsive operating system but it did not, it is lighting fast and the camera is great quality! It runs on android OS which honestly puts my mind at ease for the most part. Donâ€™t hesitate to buy this phone! Itâ€™s is a bang for your buck! So much phone for a low price!"

Â I got this phone to replace my old one and I love it! This is a great quality phone for a good price and it is definitely the upgrade I needed. It has a super sleek and simple look that I really like. I like carrying around a phone that doesnâ€™t just work great but looks good as well. The phone looks very similar to many other high end phones that are being sold today. It has a pretty large screen which is nice for watching videos or making video calls on it. The battery life in the phone is super good and lasts a very long time. This phone runs much better than other phones at its price.  Other ones Iâ€™ve tried have overheated easily or shut down a lot but this one doesnâ€™t. The screen on this phone produces very clear image and it doesnâ€™t ever lag. The camera quality is actually really good which is great because I love taking pictures on my phone. This phone has a good amount of storage and is more than capable of storing all of my apps and photos. I really like this phone and Iâ€™m definitely glad that I picked it up!"
5417,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"This phone has (unfortunately) given me bad moments, it has a disgusting tendency of rebooting in a random way, when it does a reboot over night, the alarm will not wake me up, and that will get me in trouble each time it happened."
5418,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,Itâ€™s not bad as temp phone or for people not doing a lot.Itâ€™s not smooth if you start installing a lot of apps.Speakers sound is poor.

5424,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,It does what I expected it to do -- I don't use a phone as a toy -- or a camera. I use it to produce a product.
5425,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"Loved the camera! Phone had lots of memory and was amazing, but one accidental drop taking pictures of my daughter trick or treating (even had the case the phone came with on it) and it completely shattered the screen.

5428,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,Phone looks great.  Sturdy.  Operating system works great!  I don't know about the face recognition or fingerprint reader as I haven't used them.  I would imagine they work well as everything else on this phone does.

5432,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"The keyboard has a few glitches, no matter which keyboard I download, I run into the same issue. It skips behind the words and not in front of them probably 30% of the time."

5434,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,I bought this for my son and he loves it. His last phone shattered when he dropped it and he's starting a new job in a little over a week and needed a good smart phone that will be required for his new job. It was definitely worth the price. It'll be time to replace my phone next and I'm seriously looking at getting a TCL.

No worries here these phones will last a good while before we upgrade again. Thanks."
5438,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,"but I was surprised, I already knew the TCL brand for their televisions I had no idea that they had cell phones I have been with it for a few weeks and I am delighted it works very well it is fast it has many things it will not have the best camera but in the rest it is great it also looks very fine and modern.not everyone uses the camera a lot but I have no doubt that with a good light it helps it work but it is not so important in everything else this cheap cell phone is very good."
5439,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,I love this phone the finger print security is my favorite part about it. I don't have to remember all those passwords anymore.
5440,TCL,TCL 30 SE,128 GB,Android 12,6.52 Inches,More phone than I thought I needed. But enjoying having some new features. So far so good.

A 4 pin # set up is best for it is much easer to recall or not type out wrong then letters which #s dodnt and letters do if not do it slowly one at a time like automated call imput menu choices,etc, cuz password on this was the worst small keys of floating Google board, cuz kept getting it wrong & locked out 10 secs and affraid would be way more to total lock out & I can't afford to pay to fix that & also lost lots of money of stimlus etc so like it has many quircks & screen unresponsive online even my bank, etc and so is not the aps but the cell. A terrible one just, cuz of that. ik it'd be. you get what you pay for, I suppose. Yeah so there is that & frustrating. Idk if it's, cuz I dropped it by my bed or what. I doubt it, but according to Google this occurs anyhow.  I have never had something like this or this bad on Android. Hardest cell to figure out. I wish it had been a stylus. I am used to faster easier normal set up but the apps etc on this drop menuu cool yet odd too. I need a flag uppper tier best unlocked not this. Ugh.

5453,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I purchased the F3S to replace my Umidigi A7 Pro which I purchased in 2020. I was reading about this device and could not find it on Amazon.ca but did find it available on Amazon.com. Shipping to Canada was much faster than I had anticipated taking only 4 business days to get to me. I've used the FS3 for a few days now and here are my first impressions. First off the setup was the easiest I've ever had with a phone(not sure if that praise is to Google or Umidigi or both), I was up and running with all my apps downloading in under 5 minutes. The device arrived with the battery at around 90%. There was a system update waiting after the initial setup. If you haven't used a Umidigi device before one thing that surprises me is their continued update support. The day after purchasing this device I received a system update for my 2 year old A7 Pro, a lot of manufactures will stop releasing any updates a year after they are released Umidigi breaks this norm. The packaging was very slick and simple, it did not give the impression that this was a budget device. The device was very secure in the packaging no jostling what so ever. There were also stickers on the front and back of the device showing the features and layout of the phone which was handy. The package also contains a USB Charger/good quality cable(looks the same as the cable that came with my A7 Pro which is still functioning after 2 years). There is also a gel case that comes with the device, it is good quality but I find that it can get slippery to hold, I have ordered two other cases to replace it. The phone operates smoothly for my day to day tasks, the battery lasts me the day and if I forget to plug it in overnight I still have about 20-25% battery in the morning. It can also handle gaming as well(although the device does get fairly warm). The finger print reader has so far been very reliable not many misreads and no lock outs. The shortcut button is a handy feature although one draw back is it will only function when the screen is on. I've set mine up to: Flash light, Camera, Voice Record for single press, double press, and long press respectively. I did have a minor issue with reconnecting to hidden wi-fi networks but was able to resolve this by going into the developers options and disabling ""Wi-Fi scan throttling"" it seems to be a battery saving option, if you don't need to connect to a hidden network you will have no hassles. The speaker is a single speaker it does the job but its not anything special, I rarely use it I prefer to use headphones. The FS3 also comes with a headphone jack which comes in handy when your ear buds die or are misplaced(hahaha). The headphone jack is on the top of the phone and the power cable plugs in to the bottom, I would have preferred them both being on the bottom but its not a big issue. I've trusted the Umidigi brand the last few years and when I needed a new phone I looked to them first because I knew I was going to get the best bang for my hard earned buck. So far I am very pleased with the phone and hope to get a few good years out of it."
5454,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I got this as an ""update"" to my last Umidigi phone - an A11 - because, while I really liked the A11, I've gotten it in my head that I need a phone with NFC capabilities.I'm glad I decided to pull the trigger on the purchase, especially considering the price on Prime day.As always with Umidigi, the packaging itself is attractive, eye-catching, and high quality by itself. The phone inside of that packaging is the same.The screen size is great for watching media and the back of mine is a sparkling black color. All of the Umidigi phones I've had have been made of high-quality materials - both the screen and the rear of the phones are basically impossible to scratch. I'm absolutely *terrible* at holding onto things, so I drop my phone on hard surfaces multiple times a day and keep it in my purse pocket along with my keys. Despite this, I haven't had a screen or screen protector on an Umiidigi phone break or scratch at all.Not only is this F3S fast with its 6gb of RAM, the fingerprint sensor is *extremely* responsive and the battery has lasted me though 36 hours of relatively constant use. The NFC feature is honestly just fantastic. I've used it far more than I probably should have in the seven days I've had it with no problems and I'm so glad they included it on this model.The camera is really nice as well. The shutter speed doesn't have any delay and the image quality is very good. I haven't really had many things to take photos of because the weather has been terrible and my house is a mess, but I got a *really* good picture of my cat in pretty low light (I also included an accidental awesome picture of her from when I was trying out the ""burst"" mode while she was grooming herself in this review even though it's a bit blurred because she was moving lol)The only problem that's come up on this phone thus far is an issue with the notification volume being super loud sometimes, even when the phone is on silent. I did figure out that this is an Android issue (as opposed to a manufacturer problem) because I found the solution on a Pixel forum - for anyone experiencing this, the OS apparently gets the notification and media volumes mixed up. All you have to do is turn your media volume down to fix it. Kind of annoying, but not a particularly big deal.If you *do* happen to have any actual phone problems, Umidigi's customer service is absolutely top notch. They're super responsive and very helpful. I haven't had any real issues since a couple of phones ago, but any time I have needed to contact them (obviously within the year warranty), they've responded within 24 hours (not including weekends) and have solved my problems quickly - including being happy to replace a defective unit."

Â I've had several UMIDIGI phones before, but this one really stands out.  First, it's the right size for me (I'm 6'4"" and have a big head lol).  It fits perfectly in my hand and feels ""just right"" when making a call.  No fumbling with a smallish phone in my large hands, yet fits nicely in my front pants pocket.  It's amazingly light, too.This listing does a great job of describing the features and the reviews do well too so I will only emphasize ones that stand out for my own use.  They describe the screen as ""cinema-like immersive visual experience"" and it no hyperbole.  It is *stunningly* smooth, no shadowing and has absolutely incredible viewing angles.  It has a nice size for video viewing and is large enough to use for ebook reading.  It's actually the first phone that I found reading ebooks to be comfortable on, without eyestrain.It is fast, too.  Boots immediately and is very smooth between apps.  Battery life is really good too, but isn't too much different than my last UMIDIGI phone.  The very best thing is how well the thumb-based fingerprint reader works!!  This is the *ideal* location for a reader, as it is right where you naturally hold the phone and is on the button to open it.  I have never seen a reader work so fast recognizing and how fast the phone itself opens!I have but 3 negatives - this phone is awesome and loaded, so why not 2 speakers in stereo?  The screen is cinematic and gorgeous, and the absence of this is regrettable.  The next 2 are a bit of personal preference - while the camera is incredibly good, I could do with a bit lesser camera to have to have less of a camera bump.  I go caseless (it is gorgeous and made of durable material) and it rocks all over the place when on a desk or table.  While using the included case alleviates this, it still rocks a lot with it on.  Lastly, while UMIDIGI made the ""Beyond Dreams"" tagline less obtrusive than my previous phone, it is still there and just bugs me.  Just go with your brand and perhaps the model number.I tried to get some nice screenshots and a video of the smoothness of it but I cannot capture how nice it is in person.  It's first rate, comparable to the top of the line phones of other manufacturers.  At this price, it is a terrific buy that will serve well for years to come."
5456,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Let's get this out of the way early, once again Umidigi has created a beautiful phone. I chose the 'Starry Black' over the 'Ocean Blue' this time and it's just as stunning as the blue is.Highlight #1 - NFC  - let me repeat, NFC that supports Google Pay, on an inexpensive phone for the U.S.A. market = #Winning.Highlight #2 - A full 6GB of ram and 128GB of LPDDR4X based storage. Storage is expandable.Highlight #3 - 5150mAh Battery. Coupled with the entry level Unisoc T610 Octa-Core Processor, which basically sips battery, this phone should get you through a full day of useage without breaking a sweat.Highlight #4 - 6.7-inch Display. It's crisp and clear and does surprisingly well outside. Ok, the colors are going to be washed out in bright, direct sunlight, but at least you can still read the screen if the need arises.Highlight #5 - Sony 48MP AI Triple Camera. I;ll need to read up and take some picturesHighlight #6 - Still comes with a headphone jack. Bluetooth still doesn't quite cut it for audio performance and I am glad to promote a phone that still includes a headphone jack.Highlight #7 - They have included a wall charger in the box.For us old-school peeps who still listen to FM Radio, Umidigi has included one. And gome one step farther by NOT requiring a headphone to be connected to be used as an antennae - it works without one just fine.A quick stop at some niggling points: the auto-brightness algorithm could use some improvement and Umidigi doesn't exactly provide timely updates, but does seem to release an update to fix issues.Th UI is basically stock Android. No fluff, no extra, duplicated, unneeded apps.Fingerprint reader is integrated with the power button which is on the right side of the phone beneath the volume rockers, and is as responsive and accurate as expected.On the left side of the phone is a 'smart key' (button) that you can use to initiate up to three different actions such as: screen shot; start recording; open an app.I've gotten some pretty good pictures although I haven't tested the 'night mode' yet. There are standard and 'pro' shooting modes along with HDR and some different filters to enhance your shots and selfies.I still don't know how Umidigi continues to roll out mid-range performing phones and feature sets at bottom-tiered pricing."
5457,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Bought this specifically for the NFC and WIFI calling capability. Only after I bought it did I find out it would not work with both my endoscope and Flir thermal USB cameras. Interestingly the Flir camera actually connects and is visible in the program but then immediately disconnects and terminates the program.  This obviously indicates the phone is capable of the connection and appears to be ""coded"" or programmed to terminate camera operation. When I contacted the seller they said the camera will not work and is not supposed to. Thus four stars."
5458,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I got this phone I liked the phone however it was a 3G phone which most companies no longer support it is not a 5G phone which it is listed under  please change the wording on this phone

Â For the price I paid the phone has everything that I need without breaking the bank. It features a large screen, plenty of storage (128gb) and generous amount of ram (6gb). For this price point I had been looking at phones with 4gb ram and 64gb storage.When first turning on the phone I went through the setup quickly. The fingerprint reader is a must have and I set three fingers with ease. Unlocking the phone with my fingerprint is seamless each time without hesitation. I went to the OTA updates and updated the phone right out of the box, took a few minutes and everything was good to go.Having Voice over LTE and Voice over WiFi is great, it helps the call clarity and VoWiFi for when I'm in a poor reception area. Dual SIM is nice so I can use my personal and work line both on the same phone. You can disable the second SIM when not needed (so my work calls don't come in after hours).The 6.7"" screen makes things very easy to read and view. Playing games works very well for the screen size. It would be nice to have a faster refresh rate but I didn't expect this in the price bracket.The processor, gpu and ram make for a smooth experience for everyday use and handled all my gaming tasks without hesitation.The camera takes good pictures but the response time seems a bit sluggish when moving the phone around. But in all fairness I had compared this to my wife's phone which is the S22 and cost over $1000.The battery is quite large and lasts me a few days with work, games and day to day activities before I need to charge it up.Overall I'm quite pleased with my purchase. Getting the features that I need, and performance that I feel will last me a few years if not more before I feel the need to upgrade."
5460,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I come from Blu G90 Pro and wow with 6GB of ram makes a big difference performance. Screen is bright clear video. Game is not too bad but Helio G90 can tell difference in game. Great phone if your looking for clean android user interface. Umidigi F3S is speedy.
5461,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Phone is great for the price and nice looking.  So far it works fine.  Great that it has large storage size.  Camera quality is not very sharp.  Maybe need to adjust setting.
5462,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Overall an excellent phone for the price with some nice features that exceed the price tag. Phone is very similar to other phones classified as mid end phones.The box comes with a charger, USB type C cable, pre-installed screen protector and phone case. The phone has a good macro camera with a screen that exceeded my expectations for the price tag. Also the 6GB of RAM and the ability to lock apps makes it really easy to multi task. There are 2 key features that exceed the price tag of this phone. First, NFC which is something I need in any phone in order to use Google Pay or scan my house and car keys. Second, the Smart Key which is an extra button on the left side of the phone which is also customizable (see pics).Cons:The single speaker is loud enough but coumd be a little more clear."
5463,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The Umidigi F3s runs lag free, The battery is exceptional, it gives me about a day and a half of use, The camera takes vibrant and well detailed photos, the phone display is bright and good at it's price point. There is 6gb ROM and 128gb of RAM enough storage for all your apps, photos, videos and music. I also like the fact that it's dual sim. Overall it's a great phone at it's price point making it well worth the money."
5464,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Everything good, maden with care, packed with accessories and most handy: 3 in 1 programmable button I use for telegram, teams and flashlight."

Â It's hard to find a reasonably priced phone with good features, but this one seems to come through in a lot of areas while still keeping the price pretty low. 128 GB storage, 6 GB ram, 5,000+ mAh battery... It's hard to complain about this phone! The multifunction button is the cherry on top for this new budget offering from Umidigi."
5466,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Nice product with good capture and navigation.
5467,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I pick this phone and was told it works on the Verizon network. But it doesn't.
5468,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I have had it with my Umidigi Power 3 phone! I absolutely will never buy another product from them. From the first it did NOT work as it should on the most basic of functions of a cell phone---making a phone call! (the sound was barely audible on phone calls even at highest level with using speaker I had to yell at all times when making a call). This occurred as soon as I activated this phone. The screen then cracked shortly thereafter from a very SMALL drop of say 3 feet from my back pocket onto the kitchen floor (linoleum tile). I got my money back though. Maybe their newer phones are better...but I just wish someone warned me about Umidigi cell phones as I researched and believed the hype....what do I have now? a motorola and it too is a brand I will never buy again... its got a bad chip issue which makes ghost calls and the  ringer works only when it wants to.....

5483,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The overall design of the phone is really good. I bought the blue version and it's as in the picture. The phone came in a yellow box with a cable, adapter and papers (also a sim card remover).The phone itself is really powerful because it never lags. it has 6 gb ram and a lot of storage (128gb).As you can also see in the pictures the camera is really good, it takes realistic photos and especially with vif colors.Finally the battery serve well because it's quite big (5150 mah).The phone has also nfc which is great.In short, it's a good phone for pretty much anything : gaming, social networks, youtube, photo shooting..."
5484,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Update: 4g stopped connecting and their customer support is a joke. First impossible to contact then impossible to get any answers.Considering prices inflation these days, you will be having a very hard finding a phone that cam do pretty much everything a top liner would do. The price starts at 240$ tax so imagine when they are on a promotion, the price would be even better.First of all the design is beautiful, I mean the colors and the glass back panel. I am not a big fan of iphone like cameras arrangement but that is fine. The front screen has just a small dot on top which serves as a camera.Some people complain about connectivity when they insert a sim card but I havent experiences anything similar. I would suggest to read the manual carefully and contact the seller, I am pretty sure it could be figures out.The fund works as a charm, it has a prety good battery capacity and it allows it to last for around whole day. Depending on usage of course. The camera doesnt take the best shots but they are still decent. Remember the price and lower your expectations. It allows you to surf internet, play games, do your work, listen to music, study, etc. And all that with ease"

5489,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,For the price it works perfectly. I'm on Bell and calls and data work awesome. Comes with a clear plastic case as well as a preinstalled screen protector.
5490,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,No complaints so far.
5491,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Lors de la premiÃ¨re utilisation le tÃ©lÃ©phone me semblais bien cependant a la premiÃ¨re charge il n'a mÃªme pas charger au complet et un message d'erreur est afficher
5492,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"My wife needed a new phone, as hers was acting up and being unreliable. So I came across this brand, as I remember reading good things about the brand, and reading many reviews and studying the specs. On paper this seems to be a good phone, much better than the Motorola one that my wife wanted to get from Costco for $200. After researching the phone for a while, I decided to order it and give it a try, shipping was fast and arrived the next evening. Opened the box, set up the phone, transfering everything over from the old phone was a breeze. That's where it stopped being a great phone. It couldn't stay connected to WiFi, constantly disconnected without my wife noticing this caused her to go way over her mobile data limit and resulted in a nice extra on the phone bill. Next, call quality was very bad, person on the other end of phone would hear a computerized like voice, with constant cut outs making calls and conversations hard to have. Lastly the camera which is supposed to be 48MP was very grainy/blurry, and the zoom was only 2x which make the picture quality worse.It's too bad since it is a very nice looking phone, maybe I got a lemon, but maybe not. Anyways I returned it after a week of using it without any issues with the return. Didn't want to take a chance and exchange it for another unit."
5493,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"UMIDIGI F3SI spotted this phone and was impressed with the specs to price point.It has a 48 MP camera on the back which takes really nice pictures. I haven't had a chance to take any night pics yet but think that will be good as well. The front camera takes nice selfie pics as wellAndroid 11, lots of internal storage and a spot for an SD card as well.It also has a second sim slot which will come in handy on the next trip down south.I am writing this review on the phone right now and the screen is nice and sharp.I am looking forward to using this as my daily driver."

5495,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Overall, definitely a phone worth it's price. It has good storage and RAM, great battery life, and the 48 mp camera is fantastic. The phone is slimmer and longer than some other phones, allowing it to fit better within my hand, without losing any screen size. The package includes not only the phone, but a simple clear case and a charger (USB Type-C). My one slight problem is some of the UI preferences that I have not been able change to my liking, but I will get used to those over time. As always, UMIDIGI has given me a phone that I very much enjoy with a very affordable price."
5496,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"So far I love it! Very smooth, very fast.  Light weight but not too light where it feels plastic. Audio is good, very clear. Could have a little more bass but not complaining. Pictures are actually excellent. I'm comparing them to my iphone 12 Pro. I'll see how the battery life is but so far its good too. The next thing I would hope to see is wireless charging for this. Comes with its own phone case. But overall, this is an amazing phone for a great price."
5497,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Jâ€™ai commander ce Umidigi comme telephone de backup, mais il mâ€™as beaucoup surpris. Performance / prix trÃ¨s intÃ©ressant. Sont seul point faible est la qualitÃ© des photos. Fonctionnel, mais loin dâ€™un iPhone. Jâ€™en suis satisfait et je recommande!"
5498,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I bought one of these in August and like it so much that I bought my wife one. Great camera on it. It holds a lot of apps and runs all of them great. Lots of memory in it too. I would put it up against other phones that are in the 500-600 dollar range..
5499,UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The F3S with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage is a nice step up from the A13S I was previously using. The apps are snappier, able to handle more open apps at once.I know this is a cost effective phone, but my only drawback is the slow response of the screen. You can see the refresh rate while scrolling through facebook and Instagram, but I'm also spoiled with my Pixel 6. The screen is bright, the face unlock is great.I noticed that this F3S supports dual sim, but you have to sacrifice the microSD slot, where as the A13S has both sims and a MicroSD. But with the 128GB you likely won't need the SD anyway.The camera is much better, with the Sony 48MP lens. Still a bit of a lag between button press and shutter though.Again, comes with a silicon case and screen protector pre-installed. Love this.All in all a decent phone. I would recommend."

5523,ZTE,Blade A5 2020,32 GB,Android 9.0,6 Inches,"It took me hours of figuring out why my Mint Mobile sim wasn't working with this phone. After trying everything on their end (Mint), and the fact that the sim card was working fine with other phones, they told me the phone was locked. But it wasn't!  I looked up the IMEI number on the phone and it said it was all free and clear, not locked and not black listed.  In the end It took me trying 15 different APN variations for Mint mobile until one finally worked. It did not work right away either, so imagine my surprise when I came back to try yet another solution an hour later, and suddenly...everything was fine! Could make calls, send texts, and surf the internet with ease.As far as the phone goes, I will need to use it for a bit before knowing how good/bad the battery, functions, etc are. But so far, all is well, it is doing the job, and it is indeed unlocked.*** just FYI, instructions were only in Spanish and I had to change the language to American English since the default language for the phone is also in Spanish."

5531,ZTE,Blade A5 2020,32 GB,Android 9.0,6 Inches,I guess I didn't look much into it when I purchased it but it had an old android charger and lacked much more than it offered for the price. It is however a sturdy phone and gets decent signal if your carrier will work with it.

5537,ZTE,Blade A5 2020,32 GB,Android 9.0,6 Inches,I bought this phone for the price and to connect with metro pcs in Hidalgo County Texas. The box arrived ok it wasn't sealed when i Open the box the phone came in a plastic bag and the instructions were Spanish nothing english and the set up was Spanish too. After setting up I loging to metro pcs website to try to switch my old phone to the ZTE Blade A5 its ask me to enter the phone IMEI number for the ZTE Blade A5 but it keep saying invalid IMEI I try so many times untill I call customer services were they try charging me $30 to switch  to a new phone but then metro pcs customer service women said that ZTE Blade A5 was not a compatible phone for metro pcs? She told me CDMA didn't work with metro but I told her this phone was a GSM. ZTE Blade A5 is GSM it says in the description I read through it before buy it. I made sure it work and research the bands frequency that work well with MetroPCS  phone it should have work well but it didn't. weird it wasn't compatible and IMEI number was invalid so I'm returning it and I keep reading the Amazon zte Blade A5 description it says it works with metro pcs. Also i search metro band frequency its tells you which ones you need for a phone to work properly. I had high hopes for this phone but oh well
5538,ZTE,Blade A5 2020,32 GB,Android 9.0,6 Inches,"Phones are basically becoming a subscription service, but thankfully you can get a very good one for relatively very little. This puppy turned out to be an amazing value. With all the memory and functionality of my previous android but with a slightly better camera (not nearly like the iPhone's but pretty good in daylight or with a flash). Everything was in espanol so I'm not sure if that's why it was so cheap, but I was able to manage being only so good at spanglish.I've dropped it a couple times already and even without a case and screen protector, it's been perfectly fine. Battery lasts longer than a day's use. And the migration process from my last Android was simple--it's getting easier every time.To think you can get something like this for under $85 is mind-boggling."
5539,ZTE,Blade A5 2020,32 GB,Android 9.0,6 Inches,"Phone makes for a great mini computer but that's about it.Ordered this phone to replace my severely autistic brother's old one so he could switch over to another carrier with me to save some money but unfortunately due to a defect of a critical feature, I had to buy him the same model as mine due to it had proven to be quite durable since I bought it.During operation and charging, the phone developed a hot spot either right next to or on top of where the SIM card would be inside it. I had to order multiple replacement SIMs from the new carrier until the phone completely fried its ability to read them. It scratched up the first two beyond readability and would not register the other two at all.Aside from that issue the phone worked just fine but it made itself useless as a lifeline, the intended purpose in which I bought it."
5540,ZTE,Blade A5 2020,32 GB,Android 9.0,6 Inches,Great phone but with everything switching to 5G it'll be hard to find a carrier that supports it. It worked for me and I loved it then I switched carriers and it now it won't work. Now I have to go hunting for a carrier that supports it or get a new phone. Make sure you check before you buy.
5541,ZTE,Blade A5 2020,32 GB,Android 9.0,6 Inches,This phone is NOT GSM unlocked. It did not work with good2go mobile that uses ATT towers and ATT is the epitome of the GSM carrier in the USA

5545,ZTE,Blade A5 2020,32 GB,Android 9.0,6 Inches,"I bought this phone for my son, it was going to be his first cell phone. I didn't want to spend a ton of money because, let's face it, a child is likely going to break their first phone.  I'm an adult and I've broken plenty of phones.  This LOOKED like a great deal and I was going to put it on ATT  Prepaid.  First, the phone itself is great. If you can get it to activate on a carrier, this is an amazing phone for the price. I have a Samsung S9+ and this thing rivaled my Samsung in size and capability.US BUYERS BEWARE:  I tried to activate this international version of the phone on both US Mobile Prepaid and ATT prepaid.  Both carrier said nope..it won't work.  It started working on ATT's GSM network for about 5 minutes until I tried sending a text message...then I got a message from ATT saying ""we're sorry, this phone won't work on our network.""  Now it's basically a pretty, wifi only device.  Thank God I can still return it for a refund.  Even tho GSM phones are unlocked, many of these carriers have updated their services and for some reason many phones which were once GSM compatible are now NOT compatible. This phone fits that description.  The advent of 5g has changed even 4g and 3g network compatibilities which I don't fully understand but just know this phone likely wont be able to be activated on any network in the U.S."
5546,ZTE,Blade A5 2020,32 GB,Android 9.0,6 Inches,Ok product but setup guide was in Spanish only. Had to go online and download the manual in. English.
5547,ZTE,Blade A5 2020,32 GB,Android 9.0,6 Inches,Not a great phone for 80$ but keep in mind it's a very low budget phone so when compared to other higher priced phones its very cheap and the battery life was mid tier. I wouldn't recommend this phone for the price. I'd recommend saving and buying a Galaxy or budget iPhone. Even older models are better then this.
5548,ZTE,Blade A5 2020,32 GB,Android 9.0,6 Inches,"My father broke his cell and needed something inexpensive, so I came to amazon of course it was an easy set up all I had to do was switch everything over via google then contact att to give them the IMEI number and he was on his way only thing I dislike is when it is on speaker it is not that loud other than that it's perfect."

Fast, decent storage and comfortable in the hand.  Decent camera although even an 8mp camera will look great on any of the new screens,unless you want to print, which I don't do, otherwise a decent cameraUsing as a global phone here in Mexico on a TelCel SIM with no issues. Aftermarket cases are available and fit perfect and buttons all in the right places. Fast charging,but not wireless charging as far as I know.  If you want an inexpensive phone, you can't do much better,IMHO."

5554,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"Now having used the phone for around a month have become familiar with all the capabilities. Operation is dependable. Camera is wonderful. A little large for the non phone obsessed but will nevertheless still fit in the front jeans pocket of a 60+yr old. Biometrics capabilities I've found helpful however seem a bit touchy when access to the reader is limited by a protective phone case. It still works as hoped with the main fingerprint needed however addition prints in the database don't open the phone as easily as #1. Good battery life if not constantly streaming and have found connectivity (both phone and device) to be very good. I haven't seen the night & day difference between 4G & 5G as of yet but again, 60+yrs old so not gaming & streaming... I had to upgrade as my old Samsung's Android version was so old that apps started falling by the wayside so was not thrilled by being forced into the purchase but the phone is growing on me."
5555,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"Seems to work OK so far. No trouble activating it. HOWEVER, BEWARE! Unlike other Tracfones, this one DOES NOT include a way to charge the phone. It only includes a USELESS connectng wire which has a male USB-C connection at both ends. You will have to buy a charging plug with a USB-C to connect it to an electricity source. Or buy another connecting wire that has a normal USB at one end to attach it to your existing plug and/or to use in the car (if you have a car with a USB.) I wish I had seen that info at the time of purchase so I could have bought it all at the same time. Or I would have gladly paid a bit more to have this necessity included."
5556,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"Way better than my old Samsung Galaxy A01.  Has plenty of storage for what I use it for, but recommend you install SD card for photos.  A tad over half of the memory is used though, which is a little concerning. Pretty heavy with a good long lasting battery.  Takes good pics, but I'm not a big picture taker.  Check out the Tracfone $200 per year deal for unlimited text/phone minutes + 24GB data."
5557,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"I like the phone's price and value. Pretty snappy and takes fair pictures. Be sure you get the correct case for yours - specifically for the 5g model. I am disappointed that Tracfone locks out WiFi calling so it always costs you minutes using Over The Air (OTA) signal with Verizon. I understand that in certain countries WiFi calling has to be enabled on the phones but, even then, Tracfone will still deduct minutes - crazy.Remember to also get a good USB-C charging plug for your phone. It came with a cable but no plug-in (wall wart)."
5558,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"Bought it for elderly mother. She seems to like it. Itâ€™s  her first smart phone and she finds it pretty easy to use. She sometimes finds it hard to use the fingerprint reader, but she just puts in her pass code no problem. She is able to take pictures no problem, but the quality could be a little better. She has no problem hearing the ring and also talking on the phone. All and all a good first smart phone."
5559,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"I like the phone very much, just wish they weren't making smartphones so BIG these days. By the time you put a case on this thing, you'd better have large hands to hold it comfortably. It takes a few minutes to remove the unwanted apps, but not as bad as some. Worth the money.  Update: After a reasonable trial, I have determined that this just isn't the phone for me. It's like holding a tablet (a heavy one) to your head to make a phone call. I guess they're trying to please the gamers with the current smartphones, but I'm not one of those. Gone back to my old phone. I hope in the future some of the manufacturers make a reasonable sized phone for the rest of us."
5560,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"It was very easy to setup, I purchased this as a gift and the recipient really loves it."
5561,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"If you thought you could use WIFI calling in your home, you are wrong. I called Samsung and the tech did a remote check/diagnostic on the phone, perfect condition. She said Tracfone locked out the WIFI calling on the SIM card. I called Tracfone service dept, asked for a new SIM and they said I did not need it and they did not lock it out. This is the responsibility of the carrier (if all the searches on the internet are true).  They do not want you to use your internet for calls so you have to use your minutes and data. Just FYi. I am very disappointed with Tracfone or other carriers if they also do this block. The cell phone is great, very intuitive and easy to use and set-up. I maybe should have bought an unlocked phone when I had the money."
5562,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,I am so pleased with my new phone it has 64 G of space which is triple what I had before
5563,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"Got this to replace a much older phone that was starting to have problems. Still getting used to the bigger screen (taller) and a weightier phone. Being familiar with how transferring my old apps and files made it easier to change out phones but if one hasn't any tech savvy might have problems. Some bloatware was easy to remove. Setting up my home screens was fairly easy. A fully charged battery doesn't last as long as stated but is an improvement from my old phone. Took awhile to get screen brightness to my liking and selfie mode is horrible unless all filters are removed. Rear camera(s) take photos with good definition. Overall, decent for money spent."
5564,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,This is a great phone BUT why did Samsung change the charging cable? Tracfone sends you a useless cable that can't be plugged into anything. They also don't send you a wall charger. One end of the cable needs to be normal size. I own nothing that will fit that cable.
5565,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,So far working good ! Easy set up and Tracfone customer service took no time to get phone on and transferred my minutes from old phone a10e to this one .  Was needing a 5 g phone and this one great price ! Been with traction for years never a problem with them. Great service so far anywhere I go !  Hopefully phone won't let me down and no glitches ! Did get 2 yr warranty. Amazon packaged well arriving on time but you will need a charger for phone this one came with none but thankfully I read reviews and ordered one when ordering phone.
5566,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,I love my Samsung Galaxy 13. The 5G works great. So much faster than my old Galaxy.
5567,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,No complaints here. Great phone. Timely delivery
5568,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,Doesn't type very well. Speaker could be improved but it was an upgrade over last phone so I'll have to live with it.
5569,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,I would say for the money I really like this phone. I remember for maybe about a month or so the fingerprint worked maybe one and a half months. The past couple of weeks the fingerprint hasn't been working for some reason. That could just be any old Samsung or maybe it just needs a software update on that issue. But ultimately I do like the phone. And it works well and I like the memory size. The photography camera part is great. It's a great phone to have.
5570,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"I like the phone, but no plug, the usb cord had thesame end so had nothing to plug it into to charge"
5571,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,Phone is not bad but the one I received had been used. The box was open and had scratches on the phone. It dropped every call I made and wouldnt connect to wifi. I figure it was just a bad phone but I decided to return and try something a little better quality.
5572,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,Came without a sim card. Description says it comes with one. Had to order one through Tracfone. Now I have to wait a couple days.
5573,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,Personal use
5574,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"For most users, this phone will surpass your expectations. If I were someone who used it heavily for memory draining games or a zillion apps, I would look for a phone with 6/128. But for us 4/64 is very adequate.Setup using Smart Switch from phone to phone was easy peasy. I was up and running in less than an hour.Tracfone service using Verizon towers is the best. And it's cheap! $199 per year. Unlimited talk/text, gobs of data that carry over (sorry, Mint).If you are using one of the big legacy cell carriers, I guarantee you are over paying - a lot, and getting nothing special."
5575,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,Really happy with this phone.
5576,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"I really wanted to like this phone. My good ole Moto G bit the dust, and I needed one as good...or better. This Samsung does have a better camera than the Moto G. And it has more storage. But I find the navigation cumbersome, and I sorely miss the 3 finger screen shot.But not a deal breaker yet...The final straw is the wifi...or lack of it. I have worked in the same hospital for 11 years. I have had 2 LG phones and 1 Moto G. I never had any trouble accessing the wifi with any of them. But This phone (!) Every time I enter another department, I have to re connect to wifi. Where the very old Moto G still gets 4 bars, the Samsung only gets 2. And it drops with every location change. I mean, permanently drops... you have to go into settings and find the network again.I spent so long configuring this thing, but now I have to send it back. I need my phone and messaging apps. Don't have time to deal with these fatal flaws.."
5577,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"I really like this phone. I have an existing TracFone account so I bought a locked model. Many unlocked offers were priced at $249.00. It's worth shopping, I just paid $119.00 for this phone. I bought a c-wall adapter prior to receiving the phone as it only comes with a charging cable. The Amazon ad claimed it came with a SIM card you have to install. Mine came with the SIM card already installed. I also purchased a great fitting protective back cover from Spiegen."
5578,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"I've had this phone for 8 days now and it still does not work properly. I have tried customer service at both Samsung and Tracfone and they are both worthless.  Not only is my phone still not working, I now have doubts it ever will. In addition to the phone not working, Tracfone, while in the process of supposedly helping me, has managed to clear my account of all of my remaining balances for Voice, Text, and Data and they claim I must have used them all!!!!!  I've just lost about a half year of service and they claim there's nothing they can do. The phone still doesn't work.Yesterday I had to buy a 30 day subscription just to get texting to work.  Then today when I tried to make a call I got a message saying ""There is an issue with my service"". Now I can't make or receive calls but I can text. They claimed it will take a half hour for them to fix it. that was an hour ago and it's still not working.This is not so much a criticism of the phone, but of Tracfone. Steer clear of this phone from Tracfone. It's an absolutely horrendous experience.Update 11/02/22.  It is now 11 days since I received this Tracfone. It still doesn't work properly. I have been on the phone (another phone) with Tracfone Customer Service everyday spending at times several hours.  They cannot resolve the problem.  They tell me they are updating my account and to wait for a certain period of time for the update to take affect. Then they tell me they will give me a call back at a certain time to check with me. Of course the call backs never come and the phone problems remain unresolved. There is no recourse. They will not connect me to a higher level of expertise, supervisory, or management level people."
5579,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"It really works well no problems, and a step up from my J7."

5581,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,Great product and is actually 5G capable
5582,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,Just received my Galaxy A13 today and it is working well so far; it comes with a cable but not the adapter to plug into the wall?  It also does not fit other USB adapters I already have. I was surprised that I would spend $170 and not get the $8.00 adapter to plug it in and charge it?

5593,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"I purchased this Tracfone Samsung phone for a 75 yo brother-in-law who was still using a ""flip phone"". Because he used Tracfone for years I purchased Samsung Tracfone through Amazon. I also purchased Tracfone Unlimited Talk & Text 8GB data card so he could get acquainted with the internet. After 4 days of attempting to get service on the phone...including multiple attempts to get assistance on-line and on the phone...this is as close as I've gotten -  â€œYour phoneâ€™s not registered on a network, so you can only make emergency calls.â€I've been using cell phones for over 30 years with AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon and for my money Tracfone is a definite ""NEVER AGAIN!""UPDATE - After wasting a eeek of my time attempting to get technical assistance from Tracfone both online and via phone, I made one last attempt before returning phone. As luck would have it I was fortunate enough to get EMILY online and she had me working in less than 20 minutes!Based on my experience I could never recommend Tracfone to anyone, but if you go that route and experience technical issues I recommend you try online chat until you get Emily. Sheâ€™s amazing!"
5594,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,It's a good phone
5595,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,Fast shipping.  Easy setup to Trackfone.Pro: Excellent photosCon: menu control leaves a lot to be desired
5596,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"I purchased this phone to upgrade from an A11 but so far it's not working!  I've only been using it for about 3 weeks but it's been disappointing!  It locks up consistently when trying to use the camera, messages, Messenger, etc., just pick an app.  Stays frozen about three minutes then resets.  The return window has closed so I'm stuck with a sporadic phone.  When it works, it appears to be great with good memory but that's a high price to pay for something that doesn't work as prescribed.  If that's the way it's designed to work, I wish that I had been informed up front - wouldn't have bought it!!  If you're feeling lucky, give it a try but I'm considering sending this crap back, refund or not!!!"
5597,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,EVERYTHING GOOD. NICE PHONE. NICE UPGRADE FROM MY J7.
5598,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"We bought one each for my husband and I. Initially, this phone seemed very nice. It was a few days before we realized that while it called out and received calls and it sent texts, it did not RECEIVE texts. We spent all of our free time for the next several days on the phone with customer service at TracFone trying multiple fixes, and nothing worked for either phone. Finally, we gave up and had them transfer our numbers back to our original phones. Until this glitch is worked out, save yourself the headache and buy a different phone."
5599,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,I hate this phone.
5600,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"I disliked the fact that this phone requires a 20W power adapter,that is not included, but I had to pay an additional $20. for."
5601,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,Item defective. 31 days of use.  Volume goes out during calls. Tracfone refused to replace under warranty saying I didn't have the required service plan.
5602,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,"I bought a samsung galaxy A13 5G from Tracfone from Amazon.  It was listed as coming with a sim card.After trying to activate it for two hours, I called Tracfone and they told me I would have to buy a different sim card because the phone would not work with the one in it. I call that false advertising. Now I will return it."
5603,TracFone,Samsung Galaxy A13,64 GB,Android 11.0,6.5 Inches,Received without the sim card. Sent back as defective and I am still waiting on a refund. Almost a month now. Don't order anything that is sold by some other company. No more Prime for me. Now they claim they can't find my order.
UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I purchased the F3S to replace my Umidigi A7 Pro which I purchased in 2020. I was reading about this device and could not find it on Amazon.ca but did find it available on Amazon.com. Shipping to Canada was much faster than I had anticipated taking only 4 business days to get to me. I've used the FS3 for a few days now and here are my first impressions. First off the setup was the easiest I've ever had with a phone(not sure if that praise is to Google or Umidigi or both), I was up and running with all my apps downloading in under 5 minutes. The device arrived with the battery at around 90%. There was a system update waiting after the initial setup. If you haven't used a Umidigi device before one thing that surprises me is their continued update support. The day after purchasing this device I received a system update for my 2 year old A7 Pro, a lot of manufactures will stop releasing any updates a year after they are released Umidigi breaks this norm. The packaging was very slick and simple, it did not give the impression that this was a budget device. The device was very secure in the packaging no jostling what so ever. There were also stickers on the front and back of the device showing the features and layout of the phone which was handy. The package also contains a USB Charger/good quality cable(looks the same as the cable that came with my A7 Pro which is still functioning after 2 years). There is also a gel case that comes with the device, it is good quality but I find that it can get slippery to hold, I have ordered two other cases to replace it. The phone operates smoothly for my day to day tasks, the battery lasts me the day and if I forget to plug it in overnight I still have about 20-25% battery in the morning. It can also handle gaming as well(although the device does get fairly warm). The finger print reader has so far been very reliable not many misreads and no lock outs. The shortcut button is a handy feature although one draw back is it will only function when the screen is on. I've set mine up to: Flash light, Camera, Voice Record for single press, double press, and long press respectively. I did have a minor issue with reconnecting to hidden wi-fi networks but was able to resolve this by going into the developers options and disabling ""Wi-Fi scan throttling"" it seems to be a battery saving option, if you don't need to connect to a hidden network you will have no hassles. The speaker is a single speaker it does the job but its not anything special, I rarely use it I prefer to use headphones. The FS3 also comes with a headphone jack which comes in handy when your ear buds die or are misplaced(hahaha). The headphone jack is on the top of the phone and the power cable plugs in to the bottom, I would have preferred them both being on the bottom but its not a big issue. I've trusted the Umidigi brand the last few years and when I needed a new phone I looked to them first because I knew I was going to get the best bang for my hard earned buck. So far I am very pleased with the phone and hope to get a few good years out of it."
UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"I got this as an ""update"" to my last Umidigi phone - an A11 - because, while I really liked the A11, I've gotten it in my head that I need a phone with NFC capabilities.I'm glad I decided to pull the trigger on the purchase, especially considering the price on Prime day.As always with Umidigi, the packaging itself is attractive, eye-catching, and high quality by itself. The phone inside of that packaging is the same.The screen size is great for watching media and the back of mine is a sparkling black color. All of the Umidigi phones I've had have been made of high-quality materials - both the screen and the rear of the phones are basically impossible to scratch. I'm absolutely *terrible* at holding onto things, so I drop my phone on hard surfaces multiple times a day and keep it in my purse pocket along with my keys. Despite this, I haven't had a screen or screen protector on an Umiidigi phone break or scratch at all.Not only is this F3S fast with its 6gb of RAM, the fingerprint sensor is *extremely* responsive and the battery has lasted me though 36 hours of relatively constant use. The NFC feature is honestly just fantastic. I've used it far more than I probably should have in the seven days I've had it with no problems and I'm so glad they included it on this model.The camera is really nice as well. The shutter speed doesn't have any delay and the image quality is very good. I haven't really had many things to take photos of because the weather has been terrible and my house is a mess, but I got a *really* good picture of my cat in pretty low light (I also included an accidental awesome picture of her from when I was trying out the ""burst"" mode while she was grooming herself in this review even though it's a bit blurred because she was moving lol)The only problem that's come up on this phone thus far is an issue with the notification volume being super loud sometimes, even when the phone is on silent. I did figure out that this is an Android issue (as opposed to a manufacturer problem) because I found the solution on a Pixel forum - for anyone experiencing this, the OS apparently gets the notification and media volumes mixed up. All you have to do is turn your media volume down to fix it. Kind of annoying, but not a particularly big deal.If you *do* happen to have any actual phone problems, Umidigi's customer service is absolutely top notch. They're super responsive and very helpful. I haven't had any real issues since a couple of phones ago, but any time I have needed to contact them (obviously within the year warranty), they've responded within 24 hours (not including weekends) and have solved my problems quickly - including being happy to replace a defective unit."

 I've had several UMIDIGI phones before, but this one really stands out.  First, it's the right size for me (I'm 6'4"" and have a big head lol).  It fits perfectly in my hand and feels ""just right"" when making a call.  No fumbling with a smallish phone in my large hands, yet fits nicely in my front pants pocket.  It's amazingly light, too.This listing does a great job of describing the features and the reviews do well too so I will only emphasize ones that stand out for my own use.  They describe the screen as ""cinema-like immersive visual experience"" and it no hyperbole.  It is *stunningly* smooth, no shadowing and has absolutely incredible viewing angles.  It has a nice size for video viewing and is large enough to use for ebook reading.  It's actually the first phone that I found reading ebooks to be comfortable on, without eyestrain.It is fast, too.  Boots immediately and is very smooth between apps.  Battery life is really good too, but isn't too much different than my last UMIDIGI phone.  The very best thing is how well the thumb-based fingerprint reader works!!  This is the *ideal* location for a reader, as it is right where you naturally hold the phone and is on the button to open it.  I have never seen a reader work so fast recognizing and how fast the phone itself opens!I have but 3 negatives - this phone is awesome and loaded, so why not 2 speakers in stereo?  The screen is cinematic and gorgeous, and the absence of this is regrettable.  The next 2 are a bit of personal preference - while the camera is incredibly good, I could do with a bit lesser camera to have to have less of a camera bump.  I go caseless (it is gorgeous and made of durable material) and it rocks all over the place when on a desk or table.  While using the included case alleviates this, it still rocks a lot with it on.  Lastly, while UMIDIGI made the ""Beyond Dreams"" tagline less obtrusive than my previous phone, it is still there and just bugs me.  Just go with your brand and perhaps the model number.I tried to get some nice screenshots and a video of the smoothness of it but I cannot capture how nice it is in person.  It's first rate, comparable to the top of the line phones of other manufacturers.  At this price, it is a terrific buy that will serve well for years to come."
UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Let's get this out of the way early, once again Umidigi has created a beautiful phone. I chose the 'Starry Black' over the 'Ocean Blue' this time and it's just as stunning as the blue is.Highlight #1 - NFC  - let me repeat, NFC that supports Google Pay, on an inexpensive phone for the U.S.A. market = #Winning.Highlight #2 - A full 6GB of ram and 128GB of LPDDR4X based storage. Storage is expandable.Highlight #3 - 5150mAh Battery. Coupled with the entry level Unisoc T610 Octa-Core Processor, which basically sips battery, this phone should get you through a full day of useage without breaking a sweat.Highlight #4 - 6.7-inch Display. It's crisp and clear and does surprisingly well outside. Ok, the colors are going to be washed out in bright, direct sunlight, but at least you can still read the screen if the need arises.Highlight #5 - Sony 48MP AI Triple Camera. I;ll need to read up and take some picturesHighlight #6 - Still comes with a headphone jack. Bluetooth still doesn't quite cut it for audio performance and I am glad to promote a phone that still includes a headphone jack.Highlight #7 - They have included a wall charger in the box.For us old-school peeps who still listen to FM Radio, Umidigi has included one. And gome one step farther by NOT requiring a headphone to be connected to be used as an antennae - it works without one just fine.A quick stop at some niggling points: the auto-brightness algorithm could use some improvement and Umidigi doesn't exactly provide timely updates, but does seem to release an update to fix issues.Th UI is basically stock Android. No fluff, no extra, duplicated, unneeded apps.Fingerprint reader is integrated with the power button which is on the right side of the phone beneath the volume rockers, and is as responsive and accurate as expected.On the left side of the phone is a 'smart key' (button) that you can use to initiate up to three different actions such as: screen shot; start recording; open an app.I've gotten some pretty good pictures although I haven't tested the 'night mode' yet. There are standard and 'pro' shooting modes along with HDR and some different filters to enhance your shots and selfies.I still don't know how Umidigi continues to roll out mid-range performing phones and feature sets at bottom-tiered pricing."
UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Bought this specifically for the NFC and WIFI calling capability. Only after I bought it did I find out it would not work with both my endoscope and Flir thermal USB cameras. Interestingly the Flir camera actually connects and is visible in the program but then immediately disconnects and terminates the program.  This obviously indicates the phone is capable of the connection and appears to be ""coded"" or programmed to terminate camera operation. When I contacted the seller they said the camera will not work and is not supposed to. Thus four stars."
UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I got this phone I liked the phone however it was a 3G phone which most companies no longer support it is not a 5G phone which it is listed under  please change the wording on this phone

 For the price I paid the phone has everything that I need without breaking the bank. It features a large screen, plenty of storage (128gb) and generous amount of ram (6gb). For this price point I had been looking at phones with 4gb ram and 64gb storage.When first turning on the phone I went through the setup quickly. The fingerprint reader is a must have and I set three fingers with ease. Unlocking the phone with my fingerprint is seamless each time without hesitation. I went to the OTA updates and updated the phone right out of the box, took a few minutes and everything was good to go.Having Voice over LTE and Voice over WiFi is great, it helps the call clarity and VoWiFi for when I'm in a poor reception area. Dual SIM is nice so I can use my personal and work line both on the same phone. You can disable the second SIM when not needed (so my work calls don't come in after hours).The 6.7"" screen makes things very easy to read and view. Playing games works very well for the screen size. It would be nice to have a faster refresh rate but I didn't expect this in the price bracket.The processor, gpu and ram make for a smooth experience for everyday use and handled all my gaming tasks without hesitation.The camera takes good pictures but the response time seems a bit sluggish when moving the phone around. But in all fairness I had compared this to my wife's phone which is the S22 and cost over $1000.The battery is quite large and lasts me a few days with work, games and day to day activities before I need to charge it up.Overall I'm quite pleased with my purchase. Getting the features that I need, and performance that I feel will last me a few years if not more before I feel the need to upgrade."
UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I come from Blu G90 Pro and wow with 6GB of ram makes a big difference performance. Screen is bright clear video. Game is not too bad but Helio G90 can tell difference in game. Great phone if your looking for clean android user interface. Umidigi F3S is speedy.
UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Phone is great for the price and nice looking.  So far it works fine.  Great that it has large storage size.  Camera quality is not very sharp.  Maybe need to adjust setting.
UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"Overall an excellent phone for the price with some nice features that exceed the price tag. Phone is very similar to other phones classified as mid end phones.The box comes with a charger, USB type C cable, pre-installed screen protector and phone case. The phone has a good macro camera with a screen that exceeded my expectations for the price tag. Also the 6GB of RAM and the ability to lock apps makes it really easy to multi task. There are 2 key features that exceed the price tag of this phone. First, NFC which is something I need in any phone in order to use Google Pay or scan my house and car keys. Second, the Smart Key which is an extra button on the left side of the phone which is also customizable (see pics).Cons:The single speaker is loud enough but coumd be a little more clear."
UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,"The Umidigi F3s runs lag free, The battery is exceptional, it gives me about a day and a half of use, The camera takes vibrant and well detailed photos, the phone display is bright and good at it's price point. There is 6gb ROM and 128gb of RAM enough storage for all your apps, photos, videos and music. I also like the fact that it's dual sim. Overall it's a great phone at it's price point making it well worth the money."

 It's hard to find a reasonably priced phone with good features, but this one seems to come through in a lot of areas while still keeping the price pretty low. 128 GB storage, 6 GB ram, 5,000+ mAh battery... It's hard to complain about this phone! The multifunction button is the cherry on top for this new budget offering from Umidigi."
UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,Nice product with good capture and navigation.
UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I pick this phone and was told it works on the Verizon network. But it doesn't.
UMIDIGI,F3S,6 GB,Android 11.0,6.7 Inches,I have had it with my Umidigi Power 3 phone! I absolutely will never buy another product from them. From the first it did NOT work as it should on the most basic of functions of a cell phone---making a phone call! (the sound was barely audible on phone calls even at highest level with using speaker I had to yell at all times when making a call). This occurred as soon as I activated this phone. The screen then cracked shortly thereafter from a very SMALL drop of say 3 feet from my back pocket onto the kitchen floor (linoleum tile). I got my money back though. Maybe their newer phones are better...but I just wish someone warned me about Umidigi cell phones as I researched and believed the hype....what do I have now? a motorola and it too is a brand I will never buy again... its got a bad chip issue which makes ghost calls and the  ringer works only when it wants to.....
